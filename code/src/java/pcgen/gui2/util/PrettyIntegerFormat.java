 * This is to format little integers, usually ability modifiers. It uses the  * plus and minus sign (and not the

 * <p>
 * It will not display big modifiers correctly {@literal (modifiers > 1,000)}, because the thousand separator is locale dependent.
 * This is not really a problem, because their is an ability limit of 1,000 in PCGen.
