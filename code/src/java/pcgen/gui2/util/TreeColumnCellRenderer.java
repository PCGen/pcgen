/**
 * The parent class for all TreeCellRenderers used in JTreeTable. The whole point of this class is
 * to solve a very particular quirk in how tree cells are rendered vs how table cells are rendered.
 * Without forcefully setting the cell's background prior to rendering it will use some default
 * color (usually white) instead of the table's background color to render the tree cell. As a
 * consequence you will see an outer background (the table cell's background) and an inner
 * background (the tree cell's background) on top of it which don't match. We solve this problem by
 * setting the tree's background color before rendering the tree cell to that of the rendering table
 * cell. Then in this class we assign this tree cell's background color to the one that was set for
 * the tree.
