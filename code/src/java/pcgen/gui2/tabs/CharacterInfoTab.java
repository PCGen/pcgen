/**
 * This interface must be implemented by all tabs that display character
 * information: summary tab, classes tab, abilities tab, inventory tab, etc....
 * <br>
 * The goal of this class is to create a separation of UI models and the UI
 * components that use them. By doing this, knowledge of the CharacterFacade can
 * be isolated from the tab itself and stored solely within the models that use
 * the CharacterFacade. These models can then be cached so that new models are
 * not created each time a charcter is selected. Reusing models, although it
 * increases overhead, can make swiching between character tabs several times
 * faster than if a new model was created each time. A fast UI greatly enhances
 * a user's experience when using a program.
 * <p>
 * To achieve this speed goal this interface defines the following methods:<br>
 * <code>
 * createModels(Character)<br>
 * restoreModels(Hashtable)<br>
 * storeModels(Hashtable)<br>
 * </code> These methods are used by the character tab handler to allow each tab
 * to independently store and manage its own UI models within a hashtable of its
 * own creation. Each of these methods are used in a defined order. When a new
 * character is created the {@code createModels} is called by the tab
 * handler to create the models for this tab. Whenever characters selection
 * occurs, the tab handler calls {@code storeModels} with the old selected
 * character's state hashtable followed by a call to {@code restoreModels}
 * with the new selected character's state hashtable. It is guaranteed that any
 * call to {@code restoreModels} will be preceded by a call to
 * {@code storeModels} if a character is currently displayed on this tab.
 * <p>
 * Note: The states crated by the a tab's {@code createModels} are
 * guaranteed to not be modified in anyway by the tab handler. The only changes
 * that would occur to any state would be in a call to {@code storeModels}.
 *
