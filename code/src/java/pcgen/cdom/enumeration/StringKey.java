/**
 * This is a Typesafe enumeration of legal String Characteristics of an object.
 * It is designed to act as an index to a specific String (set by various tokens
 * in LST terms). This is legacy support for tokens that PCGen does not process
 * beyond simple input/output (e.g. holy symbol of a deity). If possible, it is
 * preferred to use a FACT: token rather than a StringKey based token.
 * 
 * These are distinct from PCStringKey items, in order to separate two different
 * types of function. StringKey should be used when items are being attached to
 * a CDOMObject (although a FACT is generally preferred at this point),
 * PCStringKey should be used when a piece of information is attached to a
 * PlayerCharacter (typically by the UI).
