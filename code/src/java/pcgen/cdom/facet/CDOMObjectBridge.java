/**
 * CDOMObjectBridge is a class that performs the breaking of cycles in the
 * connection of Facets that form the CDOM core of PCGen. In particular, there
 * are events that add objects (such as Templates) and as those objects are
 * added, they can themselves add objects which result in the addition of
 * objects of the same type. In order to deal with this (eventually)
 * self-referencing cycle, CDOMObjectBridge acts as the underlying storage for
 * two different Facets: CDOMObjectConsolidationFacet and CDOMObjectSourceFacet.
 * 
 * Note that listening to CDOMObjectConsolidationFacet is the preferred method
 * of listening to addition of (all) CDOMObjects, where possible.
