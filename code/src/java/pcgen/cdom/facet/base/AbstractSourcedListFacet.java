/**
 * An AbstractSourcedListFacet is a DataFacet that contains information about
 * Objects that are contained in a resource when a resource may have more than
 * one of that type of Object (e.g. Language, PCTemplate) and the source of that
 * object should be tracked.
 * 
 * This class is designed to assume that each Object may only be contained one
 * time by the resource, even if received from multiple sources. The Object will
 * only trigger one DATA_ADDED event (when added by the first source) and if
 * removed by some sources, will only trigger one DATA_REMOVED event (when it is
 * removed by the last remaining source). Sources do not need to be removed in
 * the order in which they are added, and the first source to be added does not
 * possess special status with respect to triggering a DATA_REMOVED event (it
 * will only trigger removal if it was the last source when removed)
 * 
 * The sources stored in this AbstractSourcedListFacet are stored as a List,
 * meaning the list of sources may contain the same source multiple times. If
 * so, each call to remove will only remove that source one time from the list
 * of sources.
 * 
 * null is a valid source.
