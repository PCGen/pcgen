/**
 * A GroupDefinition is effectively a factory able to produce ObjectContainers
 * containing groups of objects. The GroupDefinition is the framework used to
 * provide the construction and other common underlying behavior of those
 * ObjectContainers.
 * 
 * As an example, TYPE=Foo can be used to create an ObjectContainer (the
 * CDOMGroupReference is the ObjectContainer). That would be a static grouping
 * based on TYPE. A Primitive is also an ObjectContainer, that is loaded as a
 * separate token (vs. being built-in like TYPE=)
 * 
 * GroupDefinition is useful for producing dynamic groupings. This "dynamic"
 * behavior does not mean that the set can change after data is loaded - it
 * can't based on the design of the system and the semantic definition of
 * FACT/FACTSET, but that the grouping is not known until the Data Control file
 * is loaded. Since they are not static tokens (like Primitives), we need
 * another method to produce the ObjectContainer. The GroupDefinition provides
 * that capability.
