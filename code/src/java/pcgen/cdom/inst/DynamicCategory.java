/**
 * A DynamicCategory is a method for keeping different Formats of Dynamic objects
 * separated.
 * 
 * For example, when Movement and Vision are defined as DYNAMIC objects, we need a method
 * of keeping those separated when someone tries to look up a certain object (e.g. "Fly").
 * Since those objects share a class upon construction (Dynamic.class), it can't be done
 * like a Skill or Language, we need to have a more complicated method like what we use
 * with Abilities. We thus use a higher level of separation - which is a Category.
 * Therefore, all Dynamic objects are categorized, that category name is defined by the
 * DYNAMICSCOPE (which in effect triggers the construction of the DynamicCategory for a
 * certain type of Dynamic).
 * 
 * This is a simple, non-hierarchical Category.
