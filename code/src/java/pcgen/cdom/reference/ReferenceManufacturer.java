/**
 * A ReferenceManufacturer is an object capable of creating CDOMReferences of a
 * given "form". That "form" includes a specific Class of CDOMObject, or a
 * specific Class/Category for Categorized CDOMObjects.
 * 
 * The Class serves two purposes.
 * 
 * 1) This provides a universal interface, so it simplifies the LoadContext
 * class structure/code under categorized/non-categorized conditions
 * 
 * 2) This provides a method of constructing references after the class (or
 * class and context) have been established. By separating these actions,
 * references can be constructed at a time that is independent of the
 * class/context resolution. This allows for tokens which can refer to both
 * categorized and non-categorized objects (e.g. QUALIFY) to operate clearly and
 * with methods that are Generic-friendly.
 * 
 * Behavioral Notes: It is expected that various methods will interact with each
 * other. This is especially true with respect to buildDeferredObjects(). It is
 * expected that object identifiers passed to constructIfNecessary(String) not
 * result in objects being constructed (with appropriate consequences to methods
 * like containsObject(T) ) before buildDeferredObjects() is called, but will
 * result in objects being constructed (with appropriate consequences to methods
 * like containsObject(T) ) after buildDeferredObjects() is called.
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            The Class of object this ReferenceManufacturer can manufacture
