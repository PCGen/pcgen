/**
 * A TransparentReference is a Reference that can be resolved using a
 * ReferenceManufacturer.
 * 
 * TransparentReference is designed to be used in situations where a reference
 * to a specific object is required, but the appropriate ReferenceManufacturer
 * has not yet been constructed.
 * 
 * Implementation Note: In a particular example of where TransparentReference is
 * required, a ReferenceManufacturer is typically built during the load of a
 * Campaign (PCC and LST files). Since there are global tokens work in a Game
 * Mode (which is loaded only once at program launch, not when individual
 * Campaigns are loaded), the references in the Game Mode must be reusable for
 * every collection of Campaigns loaded under that Game Mode. By creating
 * TransparentReferences when the Game Mode is loaded, those
 * TransparentReferences can be resolved using the ReferenceManufacturer for the
 * Campaigns, and the TransparentReferences can be reused as the set of
 * Campaigns is changed during runs of PCGen.
 * 
 * It is intended that this interface is used on an object that extends
 * CDOMReference.
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            The Class of object this TransparentReference references
