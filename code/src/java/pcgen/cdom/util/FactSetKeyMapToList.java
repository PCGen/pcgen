/**
 * This encapsulates a MapToList in a typesafe and value-semantic way.
 * 
 * Specifically, when Generics are properly used by a class using a
 * FactSetKeyMapToList, this class ensures that any FactSetKey will only return
 * a List of the same Generic type as the FactSetKey. Note this relationship is
 * only enforced with Generics, and could be violated if Generics are not
 * properly used.
 * 
 * This Class also is reference-semantic with respect to the Map and the List.
 * In other words, the modification of any Collection returned by a
 * FactSetKeyMapToList will not impact the internal contents of the
 * FactSetKeyMapToList. Also, any Collection used as a parameter to a method is
 * not stored directly, the Collection can be modified after the method has
 * returned without impacting the internal contents of the FactSetKeyMapToList.
 * 
 * **NOTE** This class is NOT thread safe.

	 * to change for each individual FactSetKey/List contained within the
	 * HashMapToList. I don't believe it is possible with Generics in Java.
	 * Thus, this entire class is filled with Generic warnings.
	 * 
	 * The advantage of having this class is two-fold: 1) It is value-semantic
	 * with respect to the Map and the List [but not the contents of the Lists])
	 * 2) It hides all of the generic warnings in once place where they can be
