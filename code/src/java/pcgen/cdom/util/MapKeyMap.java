/**
 * This encapsulates a DoubleKeyMap in a typesafe and value-semantic way.
 * 
 * Specifically, when Generics are properly used by a class using a MapKeyMap,
 * this class ensures that any MapKey will only return a Map of the same Generic
 * type as the MapKey. Note this relationship is only enforced with Generics,
 * and could be violated if Generics are not properly used.
 * 
 * This Class also is reference-semantic with respect to the Maps. In other
 * words, the modification of any Collection returned by a MapKeyMap will not
 * impact the internal contents of the MapKeyMap. Also, any Collection used as a
 * parameter to a method is not stored directly, the Collection can be modified
 * after the method has returned without impacting the internal contents of the
 * MapKeyMap.
 * 
 * **NOTE** This class is NOT thread safe.
