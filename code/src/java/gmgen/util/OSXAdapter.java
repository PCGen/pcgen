/*
 * OSXAdapter.java
 *
 * This is a modified version of Apple's OSXAdapter.java developers example.
 *
 * This sample uses a single class with clear, static entry points for hooking existing preferences,
 * about, quit functionality from an existing Java app into handlers for the Mac OS X application
 * menu.  The class is loaded using reflection, so that it will only be referenced by platforms
 * that actually support the Apple EAWT.  The built product should run unmodified on any
 * Java implementations.  Useful for developers looking to support multiple platforms with
 * a single codebase, and support Mac OS X features with minimal impact.
 * Requirements: Mac OS X 10.2 or later; Java 1.4.1 or later
