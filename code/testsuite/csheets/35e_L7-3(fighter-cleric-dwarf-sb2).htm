    <TITLE>Thor Khazad - David (0 Points) in Statblock Format</TITLE>
    <!--
        This format was requested by one of the people in my group.
        It's designed to match the official WotC Statblock style.
        ~~~ arcady 11/10/2001

           Barak helped me (basically, he told me what to do!) update this.  Changes include:
           modifying the spellbook so it conforms with WotC style better by listing the
           number of times a spell is memorized, listing multiple spellbooks, listing only
           chosen feats (not class feats or virtual feats, as WotC statblocks do not do this
           either), correcting some syntax for 4.x.x, and a few other minor format changes.
