    <TITLE>Gulak Kurgar - (0 Points) in Statblock Format</TITLE>
    <!--
        This format was requested by one of the people in my group.
        It's designed to match the official WotC Statblock style.

           Barak helped me (basically, he told me what to do!) update this.  Changes include:
           modifying the spellbook so it conforms with WotC style better by listing the
           number of times a spell is memorized, listing multiple spellbooks, listing only
           chosen feats (not class feats or virtual feats, as WotC statblocks do not do this
           either), correcting some syntax for 4.x.x, and a few other minor format changes.
