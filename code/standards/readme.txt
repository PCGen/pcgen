Code in this project is supposed to follow Sun's Java Code Conventions (http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/), with the following exceptions/clarifications:

Braces on next line.
Indent with tabs only (set tab size to 4.)
Single-class imports only, and they must be sorted.
It's strongly discouraged to have lines longer than 80 characters, but it's currently allowed to have up to 120.
It's ok, but not required, to sort methods.
Otherwise, follow Sun's guidelines.


Settings files for various code formatting tools can be found in this directory. The Jalopy file is considered to be the master. I've tried to set up the others to match that.

eclipse30_pcgen.xml is for Eclipse 3.0 M6 with the 'new' code formatter.
idea_pcgen.xml is for Intellij IDEA Aurora build 1035
jalopy_pcgen.xml is for jalopy 1.0b10

If you can provide setting files that match the jalopy settings for other tools, feel free to add them.

Before you change this file or any of the settings files, please bring it up on the forum.
