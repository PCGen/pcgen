Code in this project is supposed to follow Sun's Java Code Conventions (http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/), with the following exceptions/clarifications:

Braces on next line.
Indent with tabs only (set tab size to 4.)
Single-class imports only, and they must be sorted.
The line length is strictly 90 characters.
It's ok, but not required, to sort methods.
Otherwise, follow Sun's guidelines.


Settings files for various code formatting tools can be found in this directory. The Jalopy file is considered to be the master. I've tried to set up the others to match that.

idea_pcgen.xml is for Intellij IDEA Aurora build 1035

Before you change this file or any of the settings files, please bring it up on the forum.
