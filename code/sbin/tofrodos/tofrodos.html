<h1>Tofrodos - Converts text files between MSDOS and Unix file formats</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>
<span class="programname">fromdos</span> [options] [<span class="filename">file...</span>]<br />
<span class="programname">todos</span> [options] [<span class="filename">file...</span>]<br />
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
DOS text files traditionally have carriage return and line feed pairs
as their newline characters while Unix text files have the line feed
as their newline character. <span class="programname">fromdos</span>
converts ASCII and Unicode UTF-8 text files from the DOS format to the Unix format, while
<span class="programname">todos</span>
converts them from the Unix format to the DOS format.
</p>

<p>
The programs accept multiple filenames and wildcards as their arguments.
You may also use them in a pipe.
If either program finds its input redirected, it will process stdin
and place the output on stdout.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<dl title="List of options available for Tofrodos">
<dt>-a</dt>
<dd>
This option is deprecated. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing. By default,
Tofrodos does the expected thing for text files. That is, when converting from
DOS to Unix, it will remove carriage returns only if they are followed by line feeds.
When converting from Unix to DOS, it will add carriage returns only if the linefeeds
are not already preceeded by carriage returns. When Tofrodos is run on a normal text file that
has already been converted, the resulting file should be identical to the original. However,
if you use this option, the program will always remove carriage returns in the DOS to Unix mode
and always add carriage returns in the Unix to DOS mode even if it is not appropriate.
</dd>
<dt>-b</dt>
<dd>
Make a backup of original file. The original file is renamed
with a <span class="filename">.bak</span> extension appended to the original
filename, silently replacing any existing file of that name. For example,
"<span class="filename">filename.ext</span>" becomes
"<span class="filename">filename.ext.bak</span>" replacing any existing file
having the name "<span class="filename">filename.ext.bak</span>". Important: the program behaves
differently if it is compiled for DOS (as compared to being compiled for Windows, Linux,
Mac OS X or other systems). In view of the filename restrictions present on DOS, the DOS executable
will strip the original file extension, if any, from the file
before appending the <span class="filename">.bak</span> extension. For example,
"<span class="filename">filename.ext</span>" becomes "<span class="filename">filename.bak</span>".
</dd>
<dt>-d</dt>
<dd>
Convert from DOS to Unix. This forces the program to convert the file in
a particular direction. By default, if the program is named
<span class="programname">fromdos</span> or <span class="programname">dos2unix</span>
it will assume that the input file is in a DOS format and convert it to
a Unix format. If the program is named <span class="programname">todos</span> or
<span class="programname">unix2dos</span> it will assume that the input file is in a Unix format and convert it to
a DOS format. Using the <span class="optionchar">-d</span> option forces the program to convert from a DOS
format to a Unix format regardless of how the program is named. Likewise, using the
<span class="optionchar">-u</span> option forces the program to convert from a Unix format to a DOS format
regardless of the name of the program.
</dd>
<dt>-e</dt>
<dd>
Abort processing on any error in any file. Normally, the program will
simply skip to process the next file on the command line when it encounters
any errors. This option causes it to abort on errors.
</dd>
<dt>-f</dt>
<dd>
Force: convert even if the file is not writeable (read-only). By default,
if the program finds that the file does not have write permission, it will not process
that file. This option forces the conversion even if the file is read-only.
</dd>
<dt>-h</dt>
<dd>
Display a short help screen on the program usage and quit.
</dd>
<dt>-l &lt;logfile&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Log error messages to &lt;logfile&gt;. Note that if your command line has an
error, such as when you specify an unknown option, the error message for the
command line option error will be issued to stderr instead and not logged.
</dd>
<dt>-o</dt>
<dd>
Overwrite the original file (no backup). This is the default.
</dd>
<dt>-p</dt>
<dd>
Preserve file ownership and time on Unix-type systems (like Linux). On Windows and MSDOS, it only
preserves the file time. Note that on many Unix-type systems, including Linux, the file
ownership will only be preserved if the program is run as root, otherwise it
will just set the file time and silently fail the change of file
ownership. On such systems, if you want a warning message when the file ownership
cannot be changed, use <span class="optionchar">-v</span> (the verbose flag) as well.
</dd>
<dt>-u</dt>
<dd>
Convert from Unix to DOS. See the <span class="optionchar">-d</span> option above for more information.
</dd>
<dt>-v</dt>
<dd>
Verbose.
</dd>
<dt>-V</dt>
<dd>
Show version message and quit.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Exit Code</h2>

<p>
Tofrodos terminates with an exit code of 0 on success and 1 on error.
</p>
<p>
If the program is invoked with multiple files on the command line, the default behaviour is to skip to the next
file in the list if an error is encountered with any file. In such a case, the exit code returned will the
status of the last file processed (ie, 0 on success, 1 on failure). If this is not desirable, use the
<span class="optionchar">-e</span> option, which will force the program to abort immediately with the appropriate exit
code on encountering any error.
