  <h1>
   Installation of Java and PCGen
  </h1>
  <p>
   The following sections describe how to install Java and PCGen
Manually for PC, Macintosh, and the UNIX and Linux varieties.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first section describes the steps for manually installing
Java on your specific OS and how to determine what version you may
have and which version to install.
  </p>
  <p>
   The later sections describes how to install PCGen directly from
the zip files, and how to upgrade from a previous version.
  </p>
  <p>
   PCGen is distributed in 4 different versions:
  </p>
  <ol class="indent2">
   <li>
    pcgenXXX_full.zip : everything including GMGen and PDF, best
installed in new directory.
   </li>
   <li>
    pcgenXXX_partial.zip : everything except the GMGen
plugins.
   </li>
   <li>
    pcgenXXX_win_install.exe : A Windows specific installer.
   </li>
   <li>
    pcgenXXX_mac_install.dmg : A Macintosh specific installer.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Where XXX is the version number of PCGen (e.g. 5140 for version
5.14.0.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The platform specific installers are the same PCGen version
everyone else is using, just packaged with installers which target
Windows and Mac OSX users specifically. Typically there is a gap
between when the official release is done and when these special
installers are ready.
