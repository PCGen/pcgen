      Can you explain to me the whole
WOTC/OGL/SRD/D20 Thing?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     When 3rd edition came out in 2000, Wizards of the Coast (WotC)
also created the
     <a href="http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/OGLv1.0a.rtf">
      Open Gaming License
(OGL)
     </a>
     . This would allow 3rd party publishers to use Open Game
Content (OGC) as long as they followed the rules laid out in the
OGL. WotC took most, but not all, of the material in the PHB, DMG
and MM and created the System Reference Document (SRD). They
declared this to be OGC, which is what the 3rd party publishers
initially used. At a later date, WotC added material from the
Psionics Handbook to the SRD.
    </p>
    <p>
     When d20 Modern came out, WotC created the Modern
     <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/msrd">
      System
Reference Document (MSRD)
     </a>
     . This contains material from d20
Modern, d20 Future, Menace Manual and Urban Arcana.
    </p>
    <p>
     When 3.5 came out, WotC created the
     <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35">
      Revised
System Reference Document (RSRD)
     </a>
     . This contains material from
the 3.5 PHB, 3.5 DMG, 3.5 MM, Expanded Psionics Handbook, Deities
and Demigods (not everything in this material was converted to
3.5), Epic Level Handbook (as Deities and Demigods) and a little
bit from Manual of the Planes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any material that WotC did not place in the various Reference
Documents is not available for 3rd party publishers to use. The Red
Wizard of Thay did not make it into the RSRD, so PCGen can not
include that in our distribution.
