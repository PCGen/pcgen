<h1>I Want to Help to Make Datasets</h1>
<p><span class="underline">How do I get started?</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>
<p class="indent1">First do you have the current version of PcGen
running on your system. If you do then you have Java installed and
are ready for fun. If you need help, open a command box and
type:</p>
<p class="indent2"><code>java -version</code></p>
<p class="indent2">And you should get something like:</p>
<p class="indent3"><code>java version "1.5.0_06"</code></p>
<p class="indent3"><code>Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard
Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)</code></p>
<p class="indent3"><code>Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build
1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode, sharing)</code></p>
<p class="indent2">If you don't, you need to get it from Sun
Systems. <a href=
"http://www.sun.com/java/"><strong>http://www.sun.com/java/</strong></a></p>
<p class="indent2">If you're having problems with the operation of
PCGen you likely have a "less-than-complete" version of Java and
need to replace it, see above.</p>
<p class="indent2">Java comes in two variety's, the JRE that you
need and the JDK that you don't unless you are planning on coding
the PCGen program itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="indent1">Secondly you should have a look at what is in
your library at home and compare that against what is listed in
<a href=
"../acknowledgments/publishersandsources.html#sources">Sources</a>
and see if we already have that product in PCGen. If not then check
the <a href=
"../acknowledgments/publishersandsources.html#publishers">Publisher
Permissions</a> section to see if we have permission to create a
dataset for that publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="indent1">This next section no longer holds true, we are
working on removing this information and putting it into these docs
instead.</p>
<p class="indent2">The wiki is at: <a href=
"http://wiki.pcgen.org/"><strong>http://wiki.pcgen.org/</strong></a></p>
<p class="indent2">Find the link marked Publishers, that's the list
of "The following publishers have either Supported Datasets, Alpha
Datasets or have been requested as part of New Data set
Wishlist."</p>
<p class="indent2">What the separations mean:</p>
<p class="indent3">Supported Datasets - Been thrown in the mill and
tested and used and we think they are right.</p>
<p class="indent3">Alpha Datasets - Fully tested as we can, now its
time for the users to use them and figure what's wrong and tell us
all about it.</p>
<p class="indent2">Click the link 'New Data set Wishlist", there is
everything that someone wants that we have permission to do.</p>
<p class="indent2">Click on the "SourcesInDevelopment" and that's
one of the two places to find out who is working on what. If you
are working on something list it here. The other is at <a href=
"http://jira.pcgen.org/"><strong>the JIRA issue tracker.</strong></a></p>
<p class="indent2">This is a look but don't mess with place.</p>
<p class="indent2">The three/four newsgroups you might want to
monitor:</p>
<ol class="indent2">

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p class="indent1">Ok so we have figured out that you have PcGen
and a book to code, so how to make a dataset. Open the PcGen
directory, open the docs directory, down at the bottom are a bunch
of .html files:</p>
<ul class="indent2">
<li><code>greetings.html</code> - just that a greeting from us to
the user. Used in index.html</li>
<li><code>index.html</code> - combination of help and
documentation. This is the same help file accessed from inside the
program. It tells new/old users all they need to know. Check often
it does change. I'll probably put this up there somewhere.</li>
<li><code>navlistindex.html</code> - Documents all of the lst tags
that we know of. This is the one that you want.</li>
<li><code>navtokenindex.html</code> - this is the output sheet tags
(they call then tokens), if you need to make a output sheet this is
the instructions and index.html has a section on output sheets, the
making of.</li>
<li><code>navtree.html</code> - the is the selector part of
index.html.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="indent1">Ok you know where the tags are located
(navlistindex.html), you have a book, now you need an editor to
work in. You can use the built in editor if it saves as text only,
with no special formatting, or you can try a special editor with
syntax coloring.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="indent1">Go over to Experimental <a href=
"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/"><strong>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/</strong></a>
, go into the files, (err you do have a yahoo account don't you,
their free and I keep being asked my password to get in so.) and
down towards the bottom is the folder Application Support, this
holds most of the editors that we have syntax modules for. If you
want to use one and need help, just ask on PcGen if you can't find
a thread about it in the archives. While you are there download a
copy of prettylst_1-35_ build-561.zip or whatever prettylst.zip
that is there.</p>
<p class="indent2">While you are there look in the files
marked:</p>
<p class="indent2">Step 1 - WORK IN PROGRESS, INCOMPLETE DATASETS
GO HERE</p>
<p class="indent2">New datasets and work in progress (Once
completed move to Step 2 and the senior data monkeys will begin the
review process)</p>
<p class="indent2">This will have the partial datasets that the
developer ran out of time to do. You might check and see if someone
did some work on yours.</p>
<p class="indent2">Go ahead and look through the rest of them, they
basically tell you the way the submission process goes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="indent1">Ok now you have all the bits and pieces that you
need. Almost. Did you close your docs directory, well you need to
go up one level and open the data directory.</p>
<p class="indent2">alpha directory - Remember the Alpha Datasets,
this is where they are placed.</p>
<p class="indent2">customsources directory - No young Grasshopper,
this is not for you, this is where PcGen places custom items it
creates inside the program. Unless its code is in the character it
never looks at this directory for any reason.</p>
<p class="indent2">d20ogl directory - Remember the Supported
Datasets, this is where they are placed.</p>
<p class="indent2">homebrew directory - This is where you will find
a directory with a blank starter dataset, both titled <span class=
"lstfile">my_dataset</span>, for you to play with. One thing to
keep in mind when using this dataset is that you will need to move
this set to the next version of the program when you upgrade.</p>
<p class="indent2">permissioned directory - Remember the New Data
set Wishlist, this is where they are placed. After they are passed
threw Step 2 and later. Until then...</p>
<p class="indent2">Either make a new directory and drop the starter
set in it and copy as needed, or as a lot of other people are doing
and moving the datafile directory outside PcGen directory
structure. To just right off the drive root,</p>
<p class="indent2">Inside the program is the Preferences screen (do
you still have the docs directory open? Double click on the
index.html, click on the Menu Items -&gt; Settings Menu -&gt;
Preferences Menu -&gt; PCGen Menu -&gt; Location ). You are now
looking at the configuration screen for darn near everything.
Please note one thing, there is no reset to factory button. You
mess this up and its reinstall time, including the homebrew
directory if you don't take steps to protect it.</p>
<p class="indent2">What I am pointing out is two fields only at
this time:</p>
<p class="indent2">The Custom Directory - This is where the list
files for custom source files generated by the list editors are
located. Point this at where you put your now custom directory.</p>
<p class="indent2">The Vendor Data Directory - This is where the
list files for additional source files produced by third parties of
the users are located.</p>
<p class="indent2">You may not have found out yet, but PcGen has a
total removal built in to the program, with no verify that you mean
to remove the whole thing, the next thing you know everything,
including the files that you spent six months on are gone. So get
that directory clear of the program and pit it just off the root of
the drive, you need it there in the future.</p>
<p class="indent2">All this reading, downloading, and snooping and
no coding yet. Nope still some other things first.</p>
<p class="indent2">Go to the directory that you made, go in and
make a copy of the homebrew directory and name the directory (in
abbreviated form) after your book. See the data directory for
ideas. I'm coding the d20 Weapons Locker by Wizard of the Coast.
That's a long name, shortened to d20WL.</p>
<p class="indent2">Now open the copy of the directory and stick the
shortened name in front of the files in there (go from
my__campaign.pcc to d20WL_my__campaign.pcc). Don't get attached,
the publisher gets final say on the product I do believe.</p>
<p class="indent2">Now your ready to dive in and start coding the
dataset. Did you close the index.html, if you did, reopen it, if
you didn't close everything and open the List Files -&gt; LST File
Class (My goodness someone did some classes) -&gt; Lesson #1: PCC -
Campaign Info.. The information may be old, but its still useful
and if you want to get the new classes as they come out:</p>
<p class="indent2"><a href=
"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lstfileclass"><strong>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lstfileclass</strong></a></p>
<p class="indent2">There is a bunch of new tags out, so there is a
rewrite of old classes and new classes for not yet covered
items.</p>
<p class="indent2">Have questions about how to setup a tag, ask on
<a href=
"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp"><strong>PCGenListFileHelp</strong></a>,
remember don't ask about the non-OGL, but feel free to ask about
anything else including Foo items. A food item might sound a lot
like a non-OGL item, but since its not using the Product Identity
name (PI) that can't be used its permitted, Besides I don't have a
certain book that is non-OGL that is sold over at <a href=
"http://www.codemonkeypublishing.com/"><strong>Code Monkey
Publishing</strong></a> in a dataset format that we can almost use
(you need their core rule set as well to use their datasets) but I
have feats that come out of it, inflicted on me by the GM. So I
know the name and the effects. I just call it a food feat that
gives me a capability to move underwater and someone comes back
with the appropriate combination of tags to give me the movement
underwater that I lack and the movement rate.</p>
<p class="indent2">So you have a bunch of files in a directory to
be checked (either for your own use or for inclusion in the
repository). A month or two later do you really think you remember
where you put the prettylst.zip that I had you download. I'll tell
you right now that the version of prettylst that I have hates two
part words, so if the word Program Files (or any other phrases that
have a space in them) is between prettylst and your custom
directory, its time to move the directory to where I told you.</p>
<p class="indent2">There is one more file that you need to find,
download and install. Get Perl. It is necessary to run prettylst.
You can use Active Perl from
http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ or find another
distribution at http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html. Just install
Perl and you are ready to go.</p>
<p class="indent2">Ok open a command line box and type</p>
<p class="indent2">perl prettylst.pl -h</p>

<p class="indent2">=================================</p>
<p class="indent2">You don't get the == but you get the rest. Its
the short instructions.</p>
<p class="indent2">I use command lines saves to a word document.
The first:</p>
<p class="indent2">perl prettylst.pl
-i=c:\prettylst\my_customfiles\d20_weapons_locker</p>
<p class="indent2">-o=c:\prettylst\sort
-e=c:\prettylst\error\d20wl_error.txt</p>
<p class="indent2">and what it means:</p>
<p class="indent2">perl prettylst.pl</p>
<p class="indent2">Calls the perl oerating system and tells it to
start rettylsy.pl</p>
<p class="indent2">
-i=c:\prettylst\my_customfiles\d20_weapons_locker</p>
<p class="indent2">This is the line that tells it where the input
directory is at</p>
<p class="indent2">-o=c:\prettylst\sort</p>
<p class="indent2">This tells it where to put the output, prettylst
will create new files that it works on and this is where it is it.
Rettylst not only tell you the wrong tags that you are using, but
it also reformats it according to someone's standards</p>
<p class="indent2">-e=c:\prettylst\error\d20wl_error.txt</p>
<p class="indent2">This is the error report. Lets take a close-up
