   The JIRA issue tracker
  </h1>
  <p>
   The PCGen project uses a system named
   <code>JIRA</code>
   , located at
   <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">
    jira.pcgen.org
   </a>
   , to track bug reports and feature requests (
   <em>
    issues
   </em>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   This page explains how to submit bug reports or feature requests for the PCGen project.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note: JIRA has replaced the previous issue tracker at SourceForge, which is no longer used.

      Your

      </em>

      If you are experiencing a bug, then describe:
      <ul>
       <li>
        What you were trying to do
       </li>
       <li>
        What you

         expected
        </em>
        to happen
       </li>
       <li>
        What went wrong, i.e. how the program failed to do what you expected. Include details of any error messages that appear.
       </li>
       <li>
        Instructions for re-producing the error. Ex:
        <em>
         Open PCGen, click New Character, go to Skills tab, add a rank in the Climb skill...
        </em>
       </li>
       <li>
        Any troubleshooting steps you have already tried: i.e.
        <em>
         I uninstalled PCGen, then re-installed the latest version of PCGen...

        An example description of a bug is shown in the screenshot.

   The JIRA system contains several "sub-projects", representing parts of the overall PCGen project.

   Filing your issue under the right sub-project helps members of the development team to keep track of their part of the project. If in doubt, pick the sub-project you think is the closest match for your issue; someone will fix it up afterwards, if required.
