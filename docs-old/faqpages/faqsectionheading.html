  <h2>
   The
   <big>
    BIG
   </big>
   Question:
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   "What is PCGen?" they cry. Well ladies and
gentlemen (and chimps), let us tell you. PCGen is a
   <strong>
    FREE
   </strong>
   open source software application for creating
characters in RPG role-playing games. Simple as that, good eh!
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   It is also a religion for some, a home for lost
souls (We are really nice to them), a place to party online,
somewhere to brush up on those IT skills, a place to practice your
good natured insults and most importantly a project of
   <strong>
    Fun!
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   PCGen has been a massive labor of love started
by Merton Monk (Bryan McRoberts) and now shared by 100+ helpers and
_thousands_ of users. It's cool, it rocks and you should use it
because it is.............
   <strong>
    FREE
   </strong>
   .

  <h2>
   The
   <small>
    Little
   </small>
   Question:
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   <em>
    "Who are the dictators of these mindless
hoards of monkeys?"
   </em>
   they cry. Well ladies and gentlemen (and
chimps), let us tell you.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   An acknowledgment section has been added to the
documentation that endeavors to include all PCGen
participants.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The Board of Directors list in that section
shows the current team leadership. These monkeys got their
positions by contributing more on a consistent basis than any of
the other volunteers. They have displayed an in depth working
knowledge of their area and are willing to put countless hours of
time into ensuring that PCGen continues to be the best Character
Generator available anywhere. You'll see them trying to suck souls,
crack whips and generally bullying the monkey populace for the good
of all PCGen :) We've even made one sing "I'm a little teapot" at
Gencon, you've been warned.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   If you have contributed in the past and are not
mentioned as you rightly should be, please email the current
Content Silverback or the Documentation Second with the team you
were a part of and what you actually worked on. You will then be
added to the relevant section for posterity :)
