      Where do I download PCGen
from?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     You can download the latest version of PCGen from:
     <br/>
     <a href="http://pcgen.org/">
      http://pcgen.org/
     </a>
     ,
see the
     <strong>
      "Get PCGen"
     </strong>
     tab which will answer all of
your questions on this!

      How do I unzip the zipped up
files?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the install packages are zipped up. Those types of
downloads
     <strong>
      must
     </strong>
     be unzipped to
     <strong>
      the same
directory / folder
     </strong>
     . Unzipping is done differently on
different platforms (don't ya hate that?).
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Windows
     </strong>
     users should download a zip utility
such as
     <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">
      WinZip
     </a>
     . Here are some
sample instructions for WinZip. After WinZip has been installed,
double-click the file. This will open the file in WinZip. On the
menu-bar, click the "Extract to..." button, and enter the location
where you want to have PCGen (Example:
     <code>c:\tools\pcgen</code>
     ). Make sure you have the "Include
Subfolders" option checked!!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mac OS X
     </strong>
     users can simply double-click the file
which unzips it. Then it is simply (we FAQ authors _love_ that
word) a case of moving the new folder somewhere (preferably in the
Applications folder).
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Linux/Unix
     </strong>
     users should use Gzip. Unix/Linux
users by there nature should know what they are doing by now
;-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, as an alternative to the 3 above, you can download one of
the platform-specific installer-files. _Most_ of these will do all
the work for you if you just download them, and then double-click
on whatever came down.

      How do I start PCGen?
     </span>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      In
      <strong>
       Windows
      </strong>
      , simply double-click
      <strong>
       PCGen.bat
      </strong>
      or
      <strong>
       PCGen.Jar
      </strong>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      In
      <strong>
       Mac OS 10.1+
      </strong>
      , simply double-click
      <strong>
       PCGen.jar
      </strong>
      file, if you d/l'd the zipped file. If
you installed PCGen from the Mac Install file you will simply
doule-click on the PCGen application file copied to your
hard-drive.
     </li>
     <li>
      In
      <strong>
       Unix/Linux
      </strong>
      , you need to execute
      <code>java
-jar pcgen.jar</code>
      .

      What do I need besides the zip-files to
get the program running?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Glad you asked, because for many of you the instructions failed
didn't they? Well here's why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Make sure that have the Java 2 v1.6.x or above Runtime
Environment (or the SDK) installed on your machine. It's available
from:
     <a href="http://java.com/en/download/">
      http://java.com/en/download/
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Mac users should note that Apple does not, and will not, support
Java 2 v1.7.x or greater for Mac OSX 10.6.8 or earlier.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <span class="underline">
      Will PCGen run on my machine?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     That depends. The one thing that decides if you can run PCGen or
not, is whether you have at least JAVA 1.6+ installed. If you do,
then it should run. If not, it won't. It really is that simple.
    </p>

      Mac OSX telling me "PCGen can't be
opened because . . . "
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Starting with Mac OSX 10.7 Apple added an anti-malware
application called the
     <strong>
      Gatekeeper
     </strong>
     . The purpose of
this addition to the Mac OS was to restrict applications downloaded
from the Internet from launching. Initially Gatekeeper had no
teeth, requiring the user to "opt-in" as it's default startup
settings were to allow everything to run. Starting with Mac OSX
10.8, Gatekeeper's default setting was changed to restrict
everything that was not downloaded either from the App Store or
from an otherwise "identified" developer. Fortunately Apple did
provide for a workaround which is described below:
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Gatekeeper Bypass Instructions
     </strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Open System Preferences by choosing it from the Apple
menu.
     </li>
     <li>
      Select the "Security &amp; Privacy" control panel and go to the
"General" tab.
     </li>
     <li>
      Under "Allow applications downloaded from:" click the radio
button next to "Anywhere".
     </li>
     <li>
      On the dialog box that pops up select the "Allow From Anywhere"
button to change the setting and close the Preferences window.
     </li>
     <li>
      Launch PCGen and verify that it is working. (If PCGen still
doesn't launch please drop by the PCGen forum and provide a
report.)
     </li>
     <li>
      Relaunch System Preferences and change Gatekeeper's settings
back to the original setting.
     </li>
    </ol>

     * - There are several different messages that
can be seen as part of this issue including the following:
     <br/>
     a.
     <em>
      "PCGen x.xx.xx" can't be opened because it is
from an unidentified developer.
     </em>
     <br/>
     b.
     <em>
      "PCGen x.xx.xx" is damaged and can't be opened.
You should move it to the Trash.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The installed version of PCGen will now run without the need to
change Gatekeeper's setting.

      Why is the Source "Load" tab all
grey?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     This might be because your machine have a problem finding the
files PCGen refers to. There is no easy way to fix this (there
never is). There are machine-specific releases of PCGen available,
but unless you choose to use one of these, you'll have to manually
change the addressing in the files you're to access. Normally this
is a case of changing a
     <code>/</code>
     to a
     <code>\</code>
     or the
other way round. Also make sure that you don't try to access
something like
     <code>c:/program files/pcgen/</code>
     when you should
be accessing
     <code>c:/program~1/pcgen/</code>
     , or vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
     Note that on Windows, enclosing the entire path in double
quotation marks is an acceptable way to accessing the directory,
i.e.
     <code>"c:\program files\pcgen\"</code>
     .

     Why can't I make a new character? The
"New" menu-item is grayed out.
    </span>
    <p>
     This is probably the most asked question so far. The answer is
this: Before you can make a character, you must tell PCGen which
rule books it should use. In other words, you must load one or more
source books or modules listed under the "Source Material"-tab
before you can make a new character. Make sure that at least one
module is marked by a "Y" instead of a "N".
    </p>
    <p>
     You might wonder why PCGen doesn't do this automatically. This
is because PCGen is made to be a RPG-generator. As it stands now,
you may choose to load a Fantasy, Sci-Fi or Contempory module
instead. Had PCGen automatically loaded a module, say the Fantasy
module, it would have been the wrong one and you would then grumble
about our stupid defaults while you unloaded that module so you
could then load the module you wanted, the Sci-Fi
RPG-character.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are options to load sources on start up or as you open a
PC, take your pick, we don't mind ;-).

    <span class="underline">
     What values can be passed in on the
command line?
    </span>
    <p>
     When runing pcgen form the command line, the following options
are recognised. Please note that the options are expected to
formatted as -Doption=value
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       pcgen.filepaths
      </strong>
      - Specify the location of the
filepaths file, which lists where the other settings files are
expected.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       pcgen.options
      </strong>
      - Specify the location of the
options file, which lists what options have been selected, mainly
in the preferences section.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       pcgen.filter
      </strong>
      - Specify the location of the
filter file, which lists what filters were last selected for each
tab.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       pcgen.templatefile
      </strong>
      - Specify the character
sheet template file to be used for automatically generating a
character sheet.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       pcgen.inputfile
      </strong>
      - Specify the PCG file of the
character to be used for automatically generating a character
sheet.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       pcgen.outputfile
      </strong>
      - Specify the name of the
output file in which the automatically generated character sheet
will be stored.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     When a value is specified for pcgen.inputfile, the program runs
in command line only mode and does not display the gui, but instead
generates a character sheet and exits.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition you can provide any number of character or party
files for PCGen to load on startup by just listing them on the
command line.
