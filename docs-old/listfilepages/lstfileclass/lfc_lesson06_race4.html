   This will be the final lesson on creating "monster" race files.
Once you've read through this and understand it (and the preceding
lessons) you should not have too much difficulty in creating a
monster race file for PCGen.
  </p>
  <p>
   With that said, there's a lot of material to be covered, so lets
dive right in.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>MONCSKILL</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   To define the skills that are considered class skill for each
race we use the
   <code>MONCSKILL</code>
   tag.  Following the tag
is a list of the race's class skills, separated by the pipe ("|")
character.
  </p>
  <p>
   To determine a race's class skills, we once again turn to the
"Skills" section of the race's listing (when entering an existing
source and not making up a new race).  Every skill listed
there is a class skill for that race.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar's entry would be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>MONCSKILL:Concentration|Escape
Artist|Hide|TYPE.Knowledge|TYPE.Craft|Listen|Move
Silently|Search|Sense Motive|Spellcraft|Spot</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Note that we have granted ALL Knowledge and Craft skills as
racial skills since they may choose from among all of them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The entry for the Ninja Monkey will be much shorter.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>MONCSKILL:Balance|Hide|Jump|Listen|Move
Silently|Spot</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The class skills for the Solar in the RSRD are a little different
than in the SRD. The tag in 3.5 would look like:
   <br/>
   MONCSKILL:Concentration|TYPE.Craft|TYPE.Knowledge|Diplomacy|Escape
Artist|Hide|Listen|Move Silently|Search|Sense
Motive|Spellcraft|Spot.
   <br/>
   Note the neither Survival nor Use Rope are class skills since they
are only listed for skill synergy purposes.
   <br/>
   The Ninja Monkey is unchanged. It should be noted that Balance
   <strong>
    is
   </strong>
   a class skill even though they have no ranks in
it since they have a racial bonus to Balance.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   The PCGen data team is moving away from
using the "Default Monster" setting.  Default Monster Kits are
being used instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now comes another section where we have to work backwards to
arrive at the numbers we need to use.  This would be to
determine what ranks the race gets in each skill.
  </p>
  <p>
   To begin, we look in the race listing at the "Skills"
section.  The numbers given here are the final numbers 
once everything (racial bonuses, armor/encumbrance, stat modifiers,
feats, etc) is taken into account.  They assume that all
equipment listed for the monster is present and equipped and
affecting those physical skills where they should.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Solar, the first skill listed is Concentration. 
The final value should be +16.  We'll begin by subtracting the
appropriate stat modifier (5 from constitution), so we're down to
+11.  Looking further, we see no racial skill modifiers for
this skill, no feats that affect it and since it's not a physical
feat equipment would have no effect.  Our tag for this skill
would be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK|Concentration|11|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Next up is the Escape Artist skill.  The final value needs
to be +30. Subtracting the stat modifier for the skill (5 from
dexterity) puts us at +25.  Once again there are no racial
bonuses or feats affecting this skill. It is physical so we need to
check that there are no armor or encumbrance to affect it. 
The two  pieces of equipment for a solar are it's greatsword
and it's longbow.  These are not enough to encumber it, so
there is no effect on the physical skills.  Leaving us with a
skillrank of 25.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several of the other skills work out to have this value after
doing all the math, and the BONUS:SKILLRANK tag  will let us
apply the same bonus to multiple skills by simply listing them in a
comma separated list.  Our final tag for this skill (and
several others) would be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK|Escape Artist,Hide,Listen,Move
Silently,Sense Motive,Spot|25|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Note that a Solar gets a choice of any five craft skills OR any
five knowledge skills.  To let the PCGen user  make these
choices, we need to get a little bit creative.  :)  I've
created a set of feats that will present a chooser for knowledge or
craft skills, and after choosing one it will present a chooser
listing all of the  skills of the selected type and allow them
to pick five of them and then assign the appropriate number
of  ranks to those skills.  I use an
"
   <code>ADD:FEAT(TYPE=FiveKnowledge22,TYPE=FiveCraft22)</code>
   " tag
in this race file to  start the feat chooser.
  </p>
  <p>
   I will wait to cover the creation of these feats until we go
over feat files, but I wanted to make sure and  mention their
use here as the situation of a race getting a choice of certain
skills comes up with some regularity and you need to know how to
deal with it.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Ninja Monkey its somewhat simpler.  We just need to
determine how many skill points he should have for  his race
type and HD and then choose what skills he gets ranks in. 
According to the MM (pg. 11) A Monstrous Humanoid should have 2 x
Intelligence score +2/EHD.  So the Ninja Monkey gets 30
skillpoints to spend.
  </p>
  <p>
   I think I'll give him ranks in Balance, Hide, Jump, Listen, Move
Silently and Spot.  TO keep it simple I'll  just divide
the skillranks equally among these skills.  Our tag would
be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK|Balance,Hide,Jump,Listen,Move
Silently,Spot|5|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The calculations for coming up with skill ranks is the same as in
3.0 so I will just present the revised tags. Note that you also
need to account for synergy bonuses when calculating ranks.
   <br/>
   BONUS:SKILLRANK|Concentration,Escape
Artist,Hide,Listen,Move Silently,Search,Sense
Motive,Spot|25|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
   <br/>
   BONUS:SKILLRANK|Diplomacy|23|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
   <br/>
   BONUS:SKILLRANK|Spellcraft|21|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
   <br/>
   For the Ninja Monkey the skill ranks would be divided as
follows:
   <br/>
   BONUS:SKILLRANK|Hide,Move
Silently|4|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
   <br/>
   BONUS:SKILLRANK|Listen,Spot|3|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
   <br/>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>BONUS:SKILL</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Several races get racial modifiers to certain skills.  Some
of them are listed in the race write up (often these are skills
such as Search, Spot and Listen), and some (movement related ones)
are not.  (Gotta love WotC). Creatures that have a natural
Climb movement rate get a +8 to the Climb skill.  Creatures
that have a natural swimming movement rate get +8 to their Swim
skill.  These bonuses are now coded in the skill entry 
however so we do not need to enter them in the race file.
  </p>
  <p>
   We apply these racial skill bonuses using the
   <code>BONUS:SKILL</code>
   tag.  You can use this tag for a
single skill, or multiple ones separated by commas as long as the
bonus value is the same for each skill.  If there are two
skills with two different bonus values, you have to use two
separate
   <code>BONUS:SKILL</code>
   tags.
  </p>
  <p>
   To indicate that these are Racial bonuses we add
"
   <code>|TYPE=Racial</code>
   " to the end of the tags.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reading through the Solar write-up we discover that they do not
get any racial bonuses to skills.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Ninja Monkey, I'm going to give them a +4 racial bonus
to both Balance and Jump checks.  Our tag for this would
be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>BONUS:SKILL|Balance,Jump|4|TYPE=Racial</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The "hidden" bonuses referred to above are explicitly spelled out
in the RSRD.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>MFEAT</code>
   </strong>
   (
   <span class="new">
    Deprecated
   </span>
   ) This tag is no longer supported by
PCGen.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   The PCGen data team is moving away from
using the "Default Monster" setting.  Default Monster Kits are
being used instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   To grant racial feats we use the
   <code>MFEAT</code>
   tag. 
This is very similar to the
   <code>MONCSKILL</code>
   tag in that the
tag is followed by a list (of feats instead of skills) separated by
the pipe character.
  </p>
  <p>
   To determine a race's feats we simply look in the "Feats"
section of their listing.
  </p>
  <p>
   A couple of things to pay special attention to when entering
feats using the
   <code>MFEAT</code>
   tag:  Often a race will
have a feat multiple times, but with a different target, such as
Weapon Focus with their claws and their bite.  This would be
entered as a single entry with two targets, like this: 
Weapon  Focus(Bite,Claw).
  </p>
  <p>
   It should also be noted that there should be no space between
the feat name and the left paren.  This is true whenever you
reference a feat with a target, in any kind of .lst file.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our entry using this tag for the Solar would be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>MFEAT:Cleave|Dodge|Great Cleave|Improved
Initiative|Mobility|Power Attack</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The racial feats for a Solar in the RSRD are coded as
follows:
   <br/>
   MFEAT:Cleave|Dodge|Great Cleave|Improved
Initiative|Improved Sunder|Mobility|Power Attack|Track
   <br/>
   No feats were listed in the original Ninja Monkey writeup so I
selected Alertness and Improved Initiative.  This would be
coded as:
   <br/>
   MFEAT:Alertness|Improved Initiative
   <br/>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     CR
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The CR tag is used to set the challenge rating for the race. It
takes the form of CR:&lt;number&gt;. A creature with a challenge
rating of 4 would get a "CR:4" tag. One with a challenge rating of
1/2 would get "CR:1/2".
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar has a challenge rating of 19, so the tag would read
"
   <code>CR:19</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ninja Monkey has a challenge rating of 2, so his tag would
read "
   <code>CR:2</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The Solar's challenge rating in the RSRD is 23 so the tag would be
"CR:23".
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>PREALIGN</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Next up is our race's alignment.  In many cases while a
certain race might lean towards one alignment, they don't always
have to be that alignment.  The key word to look for when
creating LST files and doing alignments is "always".  Looking
at the alignment entry for a Solar, we see that is says "Always
good (any)".  So we need to restrict the alignments available
to the race to the 'good' ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   To set the alignment a creature MUST be, we use the PREALIGN
tag.  The format is "PREALIGN:#,#,#" and the requirement is
that the race be one of the listed alignments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The alignments have been defined by numbers as follows: 0
(Lawful Good), 1 (Lawful Neutral), 2 (Lawful Evil),  3
(Neutral Good), 4 (True Neutral), 5 (Neutral Evil), 6 (Chaotic
Good), 7 (Chaotic Neutral), 8 (Chaotic  Evil).
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   In PCGen versions after 5.7.6 you can
(and should) use the two letter abbreviations for alignments:
LG,LN,LE,NG,TN,NE,CG,CN,CE.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the Solars must be of good alignment, the tag for them
will read "
   <code>PREALIGN:0,3,6</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ninja Monkey race is usually Chaotic Good, but not always,
so we will simply not put in a PREALIGN tag for them.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     HITDICEADVANCEMENT
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   We use the HITDICEADVANCEMENT tag for those races that change
size as their hitdice change. It takes the format of
HITDICEADVANCEMENT:#,#,#. The "#" should be replaced by the number
corresponding to the last number of HD for that size. For a race
that was Small from 3-4 HD, Medium from 5-6 HD and Large from 7-10
HD the tag would read "HITDICEADVANCEMENT:4,6,10".
  </p>
  <p>
   When the race advances by class or has no advancement listed
this tag should be left out.
  </p>
  <p>
   The solar shows an advance of 22-33 for Large size and 34-66 for
Huge. So the tag for him will be
"
   <code>HITDICEADVANCEMENT:33,66</code>
   "
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Ninja Monkey, he's advances by character class, so will
get no HITDICEADVANCEMENT tag.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     LEVELADJUSTMENT
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The LEVELADJUSTMENT tag is used for those races that might
conceivably be used as player characters to keep them in balance
with all the regular PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar is such a high-level creature that it does not have a
level adjustment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ninja Monkey, due to his several small special abilities
would get a +2 level adjustment, so his tag would read
"
   <code>LEVELADJUSTMENT:2</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>FAVCLASS</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   We use the FAVLASS tag to set a race's favored class.  The
Solar doesn't have one, so we'll skip this tag for them, but I want
the Ninja Monkey favored class to be Monk.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the Ninja Monkey line I put in a tab or two and then
enter:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>FAVCLASS:Monk</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>LANGAUTO</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Many races get certain languages automatically by the simple
virtue of being of that race.  To grant these languages to the
races we create we use the LANGAUTO tag.  Immediately
following the tag is a comma delimited list of the languages the
race receives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at the Solar listing, it says nothing about languages in
the specific description, but again in the general section about
all celestials, it says they speak Celestial, Infernal and
Draconic.  So our LANGAUTO tag for them will look like
this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>LANGAUTO:Celestial,Infernal,Draconic</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   For the Ninja Monkey I think the only two languages I'll grant
them automatically are their own Monkey  language and Common,
so their tag will look like this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>LANGAUTO:Common,Monkey</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>LANGBONUS</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Races that can be player character races generally also have a
number of bonus languages that the creature can pick from when
spending its Int-based language picks.  The tag for this works
just like the
   <code>LANGAUTO</code>
   tag.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the Solar can't really be a player character no bonus
languages are listed so we skip this tag.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Ninja Monkey I will grant them Elven, Goblin, and Sylvan
as their bonus languages.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>LANGBONUS:Elven,Goblin,Sylvan</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>LEGS</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The LEGS tag is used to denote the number of legs a creature
has. PCGen uses this in the calculation of what the
load/encumbrance ranges for a race are. Sometimes the description
of the race will tell you how many legs it has, sometimes you have
to just refer to the pictures provided. :p
  </p>
  <p>
   Both the Solar and our Ninja Monkey have two legs, so the tag
for both races will be "
   <code>LEGS:2</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     HANDS
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The HANDS tag is used to denote the number of hands a creature
has. This is used to determine how many weapons it can hold. When
you go to the equipping screen it will offer to let you equip
weapons to your primary hand and also show a location for each
secondary hand. So a creature with four hands could equip one
weapon as primary and three as secondary. This tag has no affect on
a race's natural attacks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar and our Ninja Monkey both have two hands, so our tag
for both races would be "
   <code>HANDS:2</code>
   "
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     SPELLS
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <code>SPELLS</code>
   tag is used to grant innate spellcasting
(and some spell-like abilities). We use it for spell-like abilities
when they grant the full spell effect. If it is restricted in some
way (some races can use a summon monster spell but only to summon a
certain creature, etc.), we simply list it as an SA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alternately, you can create a version of the spell with the
modifications the race needs included in the description.  The
spell should be added with no
   <code>CLASS</code>
   or
   <code>DOMAIN</code>
   tags.  Once the spell is created you can
use the
   <code>SPELLS</code>
   as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The format is SPELLS:&lt;name of spellbook&gt;|TIMES=&lt;times
per day&gt;|CASTERLEVEL=&lt;level the spell is cast at&gt;|&lt;name
of spell&gt;,&lt;DC of spell&gt;|&lt;name of spell&gt;,&lt;DC of
spell&gt;|etc... If you put a "-1" in the times per day slot that
means that they can use the spell at will, and on output, "At Will"
will appear in the spell listing. For the spellbook name, we
usually use "Innate" for racial spells.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar has a whole listing of spells, so the tag for them
would be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=-1|CASTERLEVEL=20|Aid|Animate
Objects|Commune|Continual Flame|Dimensional Anchor|Greater
Dispelling|Holy Smite,21|Imprisonment|Improved Invisibility (Self
Only)|Lesser Restoration|Remove Curse|Remove Disease|Remove
Fear|Resist Elements|Summon Monster VII|Speak with Dead
     <br/>
     SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=3|CASTERLEVEL=20|Blade
Barrier,23|Earthquake,25|Heal|Permanency|Resurrection|Shapechange,
     <br/>
     SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=20|Greater Restoration|Mass
Charm,25|Power Word (Blind),25|Power Word (Kill),26|Power Word
(Stun),24|Prismatic Spray,24|Symbol,24|Wish</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The Ninja Monkey has one very simple spell-like ability and that
is Pass without Trace at will. The monster description does not
specify a caster level for the ability so we will leave that field
blank.  The tag would then look like:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=-1|Pass Without Trace</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>

   This is just what it seems, where we indicate the page from the
source material where you can find the text and stats for the
race.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you are going from an OGL book the format is usually
SOURCEPAGE:p.#
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are working from an online document such as the SRD, it
would be the filename, so SOURCEPAGE:&lt;filename&gt;/
  </p>
  <p>
   For the solar, we pulled him from the SRD so his tag would be
"
   <code>SOURCEPAGE:srdmonstersc.rtf</code>
   ".

  <p>
   The Ninja Money is from my custom races file, so Il make the tag
for him "
   <code>SOURCEPAGE:customraces.txt</code>
   ".

   Well, this brings to a close the lessons on creating monster
races for use in PCGen. Hopefully everything I've talked about has
made sense to you all. :)
