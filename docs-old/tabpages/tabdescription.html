   <strong>
    Detail

page to the character sheet. Clicking the
   <strong>
    None
   </strong>

  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Other Notes" src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_03_other.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   PCgen's other standard notes are very similar in form and
function. These include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Bio
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Descriptions
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Companions
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Other Assets
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Magic Items
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     GM Notes
    </strong>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    GM Notes
   </strong>
   is special as notes put in here
will not be printed out on character sheets, keeping those
particular notes safe from prying eyes!
  </p>
  <p>

   <strong>
    Description
   </strong>
   tab by clicking on the
   <strong>

Note" in the right hand window and the top of the new note. To
rename the note you will need to edit the name in the name field
above the new note.
  </p>
  <p>

   <strong>

   </strong>
   button. This will remove the note.
