  </p>
  <p>
   This Sub-tab allows the Gear that was purchased to be equipped.
It also allows the creation of multiple equipment sets so you can
print output sheets based on different weapon, armor and item
combinations for your character.
  </p>
  <p>
   Select locations for the items your character owns on the upper
right frame.
  </p>
  <p>
   Armors, shields, and magical items need to be marked as
"Equipped" so that PCGen gives you the appropriate benefit for
using them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weapons can be equipped as Single Handed, Two Handed and Both
Hands. The equipped style determines what bonuses/penalties apply.
Weapons that are carried will appear on the character sheet in the
weapons section.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some items are containers and can hold other items.
  </p>
  <p>
   Every item your character is carrying should be marked "Carried"
so your encumbrance will be figured correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can add additional equipment sets by typing in the name of
an equipment set and clicking on the Add button (in the Upper right
hand frame).
  </p>
  <p>
   You can then select equipment from the left hand frame (this
contains what you bought in the gear tab) into the equipment sets
you chose (e.g. Dungeon, City etc). You can do this by selecting an
item and double clicking on it or clicking on the
   <strong>
    Add
   </strong>
   ("&gt;") button.
