  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Output
   </strong>
   option allows the user to select a
default
   <strong>
    HTML
   </strong>
   (Used by Print Preview),
   <strong>
    PDF
   </strong>
   (used by Print) and
   <strong>
    EquipSet
   </strong>
   (generated from the
   <strong>
    Inventory
   </strong>
   ,
   <strong>
    Equipping
   </strong>
   Sub-tab) output sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also allows the user to select the paper type, the ability to
delete temporary files on exit and toggles the weapon proficiency
display in the sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
   A new addition is the ability to add a command that will be
executed after every export (HTML, PDF or others). If you use a %
on the command, it will be replaced by the fully qualified name of
the file just created by the export.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Example:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>cmd /c echo % &gt;&gt; exported_files_list.txt</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   This will keep a list of every exported file in
exported_files_list.txt in your PCGen directory.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Include Skills on Sheet
   </strong>
   option allows the
user to select which set of Skills will appear on the exported
sheet. The default setting is
   <strong>
    Untrained
   </strong>
   which will
output all skills the character has ranks in as well as skills the
character may not have ranks in but can be used untrained.
   <strong>
    Skills w/ranks only
   </strong>
   will output only those skills
the character has ranks in.
   <strong>
    All
   </strong>
   will output all
skills from the loaded sources.
   <strong>
    Use the option selected on
the Skills tab
   </strong>
   will default to the option selected on the
Skills tab.
