   The
   <strong>
    Sources
   </strong>
   menu is used to select, load,
reload, and unload data sets within PCGen for the use of the user.
The menu options are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Select Sources
   </strong>
   command will call up the
   <a href="sourcesselectionoptions.html">
    <strong>
     Select
Sources
    </strong>
   </a>
   window where you can select and load data sets
from the large collection of data sets distributed by PCGen.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Sourses Menu Options" src="../../images/menus/sources/menu_sources_02_loadsources.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Load Sources
   </strong>
   command presents a list of
standard pre-configured sets. These sets consist of the
following:
   <br/>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    MSRD
   </li>
   <li>
    Pathfinder RPG for Game Masters (includes Monsters)
   </li>
   <li>
    Pathfinder RPG for Players
   </li>
   <li>
    Pathfinder for Players - Advanced
   </li>
   <li>
    SRD 3.0 for Players
   </li>
   <li>
    SRD 3.5 for Game Masters (includes Monsters)
   </li>
   <li>
    SRD 3.5 for Players
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   You can add your own custom configurations to this list through
the
   <a href="sourcesselectionoptions.html#savecustom">
    Select
Sources
   </a>
   window.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Reload Sources
   </strong>
   command will reload the
current sources.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Unload Sources
   </strong>
   comman unloads the current
sources.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   The
   <a href="sourcesinstalldataoptions.html">
    <strong>
     Install
Data
    </strong>
   </a>
   command allows the installation of data sets
completed and distributed by the PCGen team as Out-of-Cycle (OOC)
data sets. This is also particularly useful for GMs who have
created their own campaign files as it simplifies the process of
sharing the sets with their players.
