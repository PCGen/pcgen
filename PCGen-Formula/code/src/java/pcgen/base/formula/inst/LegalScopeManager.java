 * A LegalScopeManager is a storage location for LegalScope used to track the children of
 * LegalScope objects.
 * 
 * Note: If a complete set of LegalScope objects is not loaded (meaning some of the
 * parents are not themselves loaded), then certain behaviors (like getScope) are not
 * guaranteed to properly behave.
 * 
 * Relationship between two LegalScope objects extends to this form of ambiguity: When
 * in a known scope, a variable name should be unique (regardless of being in the local
 * scope or implied from a parent scope).
 * 
 * If a variable name is defined for an existing parent or child (both recursively) of a
 * LegalScope, then adding that variable name to that LegalScope should be prohibited.
 * Otherwise, ambiguity (1) above would be violated.
