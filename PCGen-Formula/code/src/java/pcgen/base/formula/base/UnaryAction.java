/**
 * A UnaryAction is used to process a unary operator (e.g. ! or -) in a Formula.
 * 
 * This interface is an abstract definition of the operation to be performed
 * (evaluate always takes Object) as the formula system can process multiple
 * formats of variables.
 * 
 * It is a conscious decision to have evaluate take Object, Object as parameters
 * and do casting. Given the abstract definition, it is possible for more than
 * one UnaryAction to act upon a given operator. This is generally done with
 * different classes being processed by a UnaryAction. This "selection" of the
 * appropriate UnaryAction is often performed by an OperatorLibrary, and is
 * typically done by using the abstractEvaluate method of the UnaryAction
 * objects.
 * 
 * The reason for Object is easier definition and use, without any material
 * penalty. The cast must occur *either way* (here or EvaluationVisitor) based
 * on how the visitation works. The difference is whether the system makes
 * multiple types of operators and thus adds fields to SimpleNode to hold the
 * different types (or worse - holds them in once place and does instanceof
 * checks). Since that has limited value (doesn't avoid operations, just changes
 * where they reside), it doesn't seem worthwhile and all Operators are
 * centralized by using Object as the class of the parameter.
