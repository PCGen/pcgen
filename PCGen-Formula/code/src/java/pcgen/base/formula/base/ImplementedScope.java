/**
 * ImplementedScope identifies a scope in which a particular part of a formula
 * (usually a variable) is valid.
 * 
 * This effectively provides a concept similar to a local variable scope in many
 * programming languages.
 * 
 * ImplementedScope provides the ability to not only distinguish the different scopes,
 * but also to define the relationship between the scopes (each scope can
 * identify scopes it draws from).
 * 
 * It is perhaps important to recognize that a ImplementedScope is simply an identifier. This
 * means it does not contain information about what the scope contains (it does not, for
 * example, have a list of legal variables for the scope).
 * 
 * ImplementedScope also just a template of sorts for actual ScopeInstance objects. You cannot
 * actually instantiate a VariableID in a ImplementedScope. (That would be like asking to
 * instantiate a non-static variable on just a class [not an instance of that class] in
 * Java). You need to instantiate the ImplementedScope (see ScopeInstanceFactory) and in that
 * ScopeInstance, the variables can be processed (this is like creating a new instance of
 * a class in Java, where the local variables and methods can then be processed).
 * 
 * In general a VariableID HAS-A ScopeInstance, not a ImplementedScope or ScopeInstance HAS-A
 * list of VariableIDs. (The exact reasoning for this relates to how VariableIDs are
 * constructed, as well as the fact that they can be "destroyed" by losing a reference to
 * the VariableID, in which case we do not want the contractual requirement on a developer
 * to have to call back to the scope in order to clean up a collection).
