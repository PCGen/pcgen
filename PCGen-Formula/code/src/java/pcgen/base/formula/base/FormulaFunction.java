/**
 * A FormulaFunction is part of a Formula that performs an operation. It can be
 * distinguished by a set of identifying characters surrounding zero or more arguments to
 * the function. (An example is the min function which might look like: "min(a, b)")
 * 
 * In practice (but not enforced by this interface), there are two types of functions,
 * parenthesis functions, such as min() and bracket functions like COUNT[]. The two
 * functions are distinct in parsing.
 * 
 * For ease of use, it is recommended that FormulaFunction names be considered
 * case-insensitive, but that is not a contractual requirement of this interface. Rather,
 * it is enforced by the system that manages Functions, see
 * pcgen.base.formula.manager.FunctionLibrary
 * 
 * This interface represents the common behaviors of a function, including the ability to
 * validate the arguments, the ability to evaluate the value of the function, and
 * determine if the FormulaFunction will return a static value (does not depend on any
 * variables).
 * 
 * Note that it is a contractual obligation of the FormulaFunction interface that the
 * combination of allowArgs() and getDependencies() can identify all situations that could
 * cause evaluate() to fail. For example, the formula "age("Bob")" may be passed by
 * allowArgs() because the database to determine "Bob" being a legal name is not present
 * (and allowArgs is designed to be used as early as possible). If allowArgs returns TRUE
 * and has NOT validated the person "Bob" actually exists, then getDependencies() MUST be
 * able to load an appropriate manager with a DependencyManager in order to indicate that
 * "Bob" is a name upon which the formula is dependent.

	 * calculated once and cached if it is static. Any formula/function that contains a

	/**

	 * any necessary information into the given FormulaSemantics.
	 * 
	 * This must check the entire set of arguments to the FormulaFunction for validity, as
	 * best can be done (assuming no items are resolvable to actual values).
	 * 
	 * For example: A function such as: classlevel("Fighter","APPLIEDAS=NonEpic") should:
	 * (a) Ensure that two arguments is a legal form (b) Check that the "APPLIEDAS="
	 * string is a valid prefix to the second argument (c) Check that "NonEpic" is a valid
	 * suffix for the second argument.
	 * 
	 * Optionally, some processing of to ensure that "Fighter" is a legal first argument
	 * may be possible. This will be domain-specific.
	 * 
	 * This optional situation is a recognition that allowArgs is not required to catch
	 * situations it cannot reasonably predict: Specifically an unconstructed object which
	 * should be present at the time of evaluation. allowArgs is thus checking mostly for
	 * semantic legality, not necessarily content legality. However, allowArgs is part of
	 * a contractual obligation to eventually provide content legality.
	 * 
	 * Specifically, an example may be "age("Bob")". Since it is intended for allowArgs to
	 * be used early in a program life-cycle, it is not reasonable to assume the database
	 * indicating legal names is present. Some checking, such as ensuring the name doesn't
	 * have illegal symbols ("*" or "$") may optionally be reported in allowArgs.
	 * 
	 * However, if the database indicating that "Bob" is a legal name is not present when
	 * allowArgs is (designed to be) called, then it is a contractual obligation of the
	 * FormulaFunction interface that getDependencies indicate that "Bob" is a required
	 * name for the Formula to be evaluated.
	 * 
	 * Note also that the legality of variables or content within the FormulaFunction that
	 * can be evaluated as a sub formula (e.g. both "min(4,T)" and "Y" as part of
