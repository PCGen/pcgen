 * A FormulaManager exists as compound object to simplify those things that
 * require context to be resolved (legal functions, variables). This provides a
 * convenient, single location for consolidation of these capabilities (and thus
 * keeps the number of parameters that have to be passed around to a reasonable
 * level).
 * 
 * This is also an object used to "cache" the SemanticsVisitor (since the
 * visitor needs to know some of the contents in the FormulaManager, it can be
 * lazily instantiated but then effectively cached as long as that
 * FormulaManager is reused - especially valuable for things like the global
 * context which in the future we can create once for the PC and never have to
 * recreate...)
