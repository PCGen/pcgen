/**
 * A RelationshipManager tracks relationships of ImplementedScope objects.
 * 
 * Note: If a complete set of ImplementedScope objects is not loaded (meaning some of the
 * parents are not themselves loaded), then certain behaviors (like getScope) are not
 * guaranteed to properly behave.
 * 
 * Relationship between two ImplementedScope objects extends to two forms of ambiguity:
 * (1) When in a known scope, a variable name should be unique (regardless of being in the
 * local scope or implied from a parent scope) (2) When in an unknown child scope, the
 * presence of a variable should imply the full parent scope hierarchy. Said another way,
 * in any given context of interpreting a variable name, there should always be one and
 * only one possible interpretation. Given potential overlaps, this can be a subtle
 * problem.
 * 
 * If a variable name is defined for an existing parent or child (both recursively) of a
 * ImplementedScope, then adding that variable name to that ImplementedScope should be
 * prohibited. Otherwise, ambiguity (1) above would be violated.
