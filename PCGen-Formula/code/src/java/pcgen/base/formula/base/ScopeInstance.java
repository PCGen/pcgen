/**
 * ScopeInstance identifies an instance of a scope in which a particular part of
 * a formula (usually a variable) is valid.
 * 
 * Combined with LegalScope, this effectively provides a concept similar to a
 * local variable scope in many programming languages.
 * 
 * ScopeInstance provides the ability to not only distinguish the different
 * scopes, but also to define the relationship between the scopes (each scope
 * can identify its parent scope - if you need to know child scopes, see
 * ScopeInstanceFactory).
 * 
 * It is perhaps important to recognize that a ScopeInstance is simply an
 * identifier. This means it does not contain information about what the scope
 * contains (it does not, for example, have a list of legal variables for the
 * scope).
 * 
 * LegalScope was the template of sorts for actual ScopeInstance objects. You
 * must have a ScopeInstance to create a VariableID. (Creating a ScopeInstance
 * is must like creating a new instance of a class in Java, where the local
 * variables and methods can be processed).
 * 
 * In general a VariableID HAS-A ScopeInstance, not a ScopeInstance HAS-A list
 * of VariableIDs. (The exact reasoning for this relates to how VariableIDs are
 * constructed, as well as the fact that they can be "destroyed" by losing a
 * reference to the VariableID, in which case we do not want the contractual
 * requirement on a developer to have to call back to the scope in order to
 * clean up a collection).
