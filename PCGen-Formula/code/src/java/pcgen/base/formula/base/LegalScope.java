/**
 * LegalScope identifies a scope in which a particular part of a formula
 * (usually a variable) is valid.
 * 
 * This effectively provides a concept similar to a local variable scope in many
 * programming languages.
 * 
 * LegalScope provides the ability to not only distinguish the different scopes,
 * but also to define the relationship between the scopes (each scope can
 * identify its parent scope - if you need to know child scopes, see
 * LegalScopeLibrary).
 * 
 * It is perhaps important to recognize that a LegalScope is simply an
 * identifier. This means it does not contain information about what the scope
 * contains (it does not, for example, have a list of legal variables for the
 * scope).
 * 
 * LegalScope also just a template of sorts for actual ScopeInstance objects.
 * You cannot actually instantiate a VariableID in a LegalScope. (That would be
 * like asking to instantiate a non-static variable on just a class [not an
 * instance of that class] in Java). You need to instantiate the LegalScope (see
 * ScopeInstanceFactory) and in that ScopeInstance, the variables can be
 * processed (this is like creating a new instance of a class in Java, where the
 * local variables and methods can then be processed).
 * 
 * In general a VariableID HAS-A ScopeInstance, not a LegalScope or
 * ScopeInstance HAS-A list of VariableIDs. (The exact reasoning for this
 * relates to how VariableIDs are constructed, as well as the fact that they can
 * be "destroyed" by losing a reference to the VariableID, in which case we do
 * not want the contractual requirement on a developer to have to call back to
 * the scope in order to clean up a collection).
