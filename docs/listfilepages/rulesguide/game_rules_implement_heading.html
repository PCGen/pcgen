<h1>
    Game Rules Implementation Guide
</h1>
<p class="indent1">
    The Game Rules Implementation Guide provides a
    series of rules implementation explanations, organized in two
    sections: The
    <a href="#pcgendist">
        PCGen Distributed Rules
    </a>
    and
    the
    <a href="#homebrew">
        Rules for Homebrews
    </a>
    . The examples
    provided are not the only way to implement the subject rules. They
    are given here simply as examples of how different rules can be
    implemented. For more general information on writing standard LST
    files please visit the
    <a href="../lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">
        LST File Class
    </a>
    page.

<h2>
    PCGen Distributed Rules
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    This section includes those rules that have been
    implemented as part of the officially distributed datasets from
    PCGen.

    <dl class="indent1">
        <dt>
            <a href="grig_negative_levels.html">
                Negative Levels
            </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Equipment/Items can now bestow negative levels upon a
            character.

<h2>
    Rules for Homebrews
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    This section includes rules implementation
    solutions aimed at homebrew datasets. As game rules can have many
    different implementations within PCGen, you will find
    implementations included below that address the same game rule. In
    these cases, each solution is presented on its own page for
    clarity.
