  <h2>
   Implementation Discussion
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   Implementing "Priesthoods" for deities requires
entries in two lst files. These will be entries for the priesthood
feats, one for each priesthood created, in the
   <em>
    feat.lst
   </em>
   file, and the "Deity" entry in the
   <em>
    deity.lst
   </em>
   file where
the priesthood feats are selected and applied. It is through the
selection and application of these feats that the various "domains"
are made available, and it is through these domains that the powers
and abilities that differentiate each of a Deity's priesthoods from
the others are granted.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   To help you better understand these entries, we
will be using a fictitious deity called the "The Monkey God" who
has four priesthoods, each with their own selection of domains.
These priesthoods, and the domains they have access to, are listed
below:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p class="indent1">
    Priesthood of Code Monkey - Domains of
Knowledge, Madness, Creation, and Magic.
    <br/>
    Priesthood of Data Monkey - Domains of Knowledge, Madness,
Creation, and Artifice.
    <br/>
    Priesthood of Doc Monkey - Domains of Knowledge, Madness, Artifice,
and Magic.
    <br/>
    Priesthood of the Monkey - Domains of Knowledge and Madness.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent1">
   We will discuss, below, each of the LST entries
required, and the tags that make them work, to implement these
priesthoods. For assistance in understanding how to read this page

   Feat File
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   The specific feat entries in the
   <em>
    feat.lst
   </em>
   file are made one per line and begin with the
name of the feat. Our feats are called "Priesthood of the Code
Monkey", "Priesthood of the Data Monkey", "Priesthood of the Doc
Monkey", and the generic "Priesthood of the Monkey". For this rules
implementation these feats are used to simply identify which
"priesthood" the character belongs to. The tags used to do this are
explained below:

  <h3>
   Deity File
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   The specific deity entry in the
   <em>
    deity.lst
   </em>
   file is made on a single line and begins with
the name of the deity. For this implementation we will be using the
name "The Monkey God". The particular mechanism used to implement
this rule is that of the domains granted by the deity to bestow the
differing powers upon his clerics. Specifically, it is the PRExxx
tags that make the difference possible. Each preisthood will have
access to a different set of domains and it is the presence of the
preisthood feat that establishes the prerequisite. Of course the
first thing that needs to happen is the choice of the Monkey God's
preisdthoods, a choice which is made when the deity is first
selected. The tags used to do this are explained below:

   Variations on a Theme

  <h4>
   Additional Powers and Abilities
  </h4>
  <p class="indent1">
   The example above demonstrates how to grant
different domains, and their associated powers, to a cleric based
upon not only which deity he follows, but also based upon which of
that deity's priesthoods he belongs to. It is possible, through the
same "Priesthood" feats, to grant other powers and abilities
directly that effect the characters skills, combat, spellcasting
ability, and even the characters hit dice. To get a better idea of
what powers and abilities can be granted, all you have to do is
browse through the various feats and templates distibuted with the
RSRD. A few examples of such effects are listed below:
