<h2>
    Implementation Discussion
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    Implementing "Priesthoods" for deities requires
    entries in two lst files. These will be entries for the priesthood
    feats, one for each priesthood created, in the
    <em>
        feat.lst
    </em>
    file, and the "Deity" entry in the
    <em>
        deity.lst
    </em>
    file where
    the priesthood feats are selected and applied. It is through the
    selection and application of these feats that the various "domains"
    are made available, and it is through these domains that the powers
    and abilities that differentiate each of a Deity's priesthoods from
    the others are granted.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    To help you better understand these entries, we
    will be using a fictitious deity called the "The Monkey God" who
    has four priesthoods, each with their own selection of domains.
    These priesthoods, and the domains they have access to, are listed
    below:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="indent1">
        Priesthood of Code Monkey - Domains of
        Knowledge, Madness, Creation, and Magic.
        <br/>
        Priesthood of Data Monkey - Domains of Knowledge, Madness,
        Creation, and Artifice.
        <br/>
        Priesthood of Doc Monkey - Domains of Knowledge, Madness, Artifice,
        and Magic.
        <br/>
        Priesthood of the Monkey - Domains of Knowledge and Madness.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent1">
    We will discuss, below, each of the LST entries
    required, and the tags that make them work, to implement these
    priesthoods. For assistance in understanding how to read this page
    you may review the

<h3>
    Feat File
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    The specific feat entries in the
    <em>
        feat.lst
    </em>
    file are made one per line and begin with the
    name of the feat. Our feats are called "Priesthood of the Code
    Monkey", "Priesthood of the Data Monkey", "Priesthood of the Doc
    Monkey", and the generic "Priesthood of the Monkey". For this rules
    implementation these feats are used to simply identify which
    "priesthood" the character belongs to. The tags used to do this are
    explained below:

<h3>
    Deity File
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    The specific deity entry in the
    <em>
        deity.lst
    </em>
    file is made on a single line and begins with
    the name of the deity. For this implementation we will be using the
    name "The Monkey God". The particular mechanism used to implement
    this rule is that of the domains granted by the deity to bestow the
    differing powers upon his clerics. Specifically, it is the PRExxx
    tags that make the difference possible. Each preisthood will have
    access to a different set of domains and it is the presence of the
    preisthood feat that establishes the prerequisite. Of course the
    first thing that needs to happen is the choice of the Monkey God's
    preisdthoods, a choice which is made when the deity is first
    selected. The tags used to do this are explained below:

<h4>
    Additional Powers and Abilities
</h4>
<p class="indent1">
    The example above demonstrates how to grant
    different domains, and their associated powers, to a cleric based
    upon not only which deity he follows, but also based upon which of
    that deity's priesthoods he belongs to. It is possible, through the
    same "Priesthood" feats, to grant other powers and abilities
    directly that effect the characters skills, combat, spellcasting
    ability, and even the characters hit dice. To get a better idea of
    what powers and abilities can be granted, all you have to do is
    browse through the various feats and templates distibuted with the
    RSRD. A few examples of such effects are listed below:
