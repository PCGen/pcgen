<p class="indent1">
    Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate
    what you would see in a LST file we are going to use certain
    conventions to convey these ideas.

    <dd>
        Tags in LST files are &lt;TAB&gt; delimited, that is, the tags
        are separated by TABs. Because this is difficult to show, the LST
        examples will have their tags separated by simple line breaks with
        no additional indentation.

        files (i.e. feat.lst, class.lst, etc.) and LST objects (i.e. feats,
        spells, deities, etc.), that will be required. If the rule being
        implemented has been incorporated into a PCGen distributed set,
        this sub-section will also include instructions for using the rule
        in new LST objects.
