<h1>System List Files</h1>
<p>System list files are used across all of PCGen's abilities and
should not be tampered with lightly, even for an experienced List
Monkey!&nbsp; The next few sections describe each of the system
list files and what they do.</p>
<p>There are 2 main sections to contend with, Game System files and
System files.</p>
<p>Game System files are specific to the rules for a gaming system,
such as 3e, Unisystem, D6, etc. These files define what rules apply
for that system, such as Hit Points, vs Vitality Points, Armor
Class vs Damage Reduction, etc.</p>
<p>System files are just that, files that the PCGen system uses. As
such, these files are more susceptible, to errors, so edit them
with care!</p>
<p>Starting in the 5.9 line the remaining system files which have
any game specific bearing are being moved into the gameModes to
make them available for customization. A new directory named
"default" has been added to the gameModes directory which contains
default versions of each of the newly integrated files. If a
gameMode is loaded which does not contain one or more of these
files then the files from the default directory or loaded in their
place.</p>
