<h1>System List Files</h1>
<p>System list files are used across all of PCGen's abilities and
    should not be tampered with lightly, even for an experienced List
    Monkey!&nbsp; The next few sections describe each of the system
    list files and what they do.</p>
<p>There are 2 main sections to contend with, Game System files and
    System files.</p>
<p>Game System files are specific to the rules for a gaming system,
    such as 3e, Unisystem, D6, etc. These files define what rules apply
    for that system, such as Hit Points, vs Vitality Points, Armor
    Class vs Damage Reduction, etc.</p>
<p>System files are just that, files that the PCGen system uses. As
    such, these files are more susceptible, to errors, so edit them
    with care!</p>
<p>Starting in the 5.9 line the remaining system files which have
    any game specific bearing are being moved into the gameModes to
    make them available for customization. A new directory named
    "default" has been added to the gameModes directory which contains
    default versions of each of the newly integrated files. If a
    gameMode is loaded which does not contain one or more of these
    files then the files from the default directory or loaded in their
    place.</p>
