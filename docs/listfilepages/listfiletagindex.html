   List File Tag Index
  </h1>
  <p>
   We have several resources to help those wishing to learn the
arcane craft of dataset creation. A good place to start is the
   <a href="lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">
    LST File
Classes
   </a>
   , they give a good overview of the basics of the dataset
structure as well as detailed instructions on coding races. Another
good resource is the homebrew/my_dataset directory in the data
folder. This is a framework for a PCGen dataset. It is meant for
beginners who want to take their first steps in entering their own
custom data into PCGen and have found that the built-in List
Editors are too limiting for what they intend to do. It contains
some commented out examples and a lot of advice and tips for
putting your own sets together. You can get up and running fast by
renaming the elements in this set to your suit your needs. Once you
start delving deep into LST code you're going to want to keep the
   <a href="../navlistindex.html">

   </a>
   , most LST tags
have been documented with details on their use.

   Some tags are labeled New or Updated as well as Deprecate.

  <div class="indent1">

    <strong>
     New:
    </strong>
   </div>
   New tags usually indicate the version in which they were added to
the program.
  </div>
  <div class="indent1">
   <div class="alpha">
    <strong>
     Updated:
    </strong>
   </div>
   Updated tags also indicate the version in which they were
updated.
  </div>
  <div class="indent1">
   <div class="alpha">
    <strong>
     Deprecated:
    </strong>
   </div>
   Deprecated tags are scheduled to be removed from the program.
Deprecated tags should still parse and work as they did before but
will not in future versions. Deprecated tag entries should indicate
the tag that replaces it.
