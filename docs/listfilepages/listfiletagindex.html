<h1>
    List File Tag Index
</h1>
<p>
    We have several resources to help those wishing to learn the
    arcane craft of dataset creation. A good place to start is the
    <a href="lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">
        LST File
        Classes
    </a>
    , they give a good overview of the basics of the dataset
    structure as well as detailed instructions on coding races. Another
    good resource is the homebrew/my_dataset directory in the data
    folder. This is a framework for a PCGen dataset. It is meant for
    beginners who want to take their first steps in entering their own
    custom data into PCGen and have found that the built-in List
    Editors are too limiting for what they intend to do. It contains
    some commented out examples and a lot of advice and tips for
    putting your own sets together. You can get up and running fast by
    renaming the elements in this set to your suit your needs. Once you
    start delving deep into LST code you're going to want to keep the
    <a href="../navlistindex.html">

    </a>
    , most LST tags
    have been documented with details on their use.

    Some tags are labeled New or Updated as well as Deprecate.

<div class="indent1">
    <div class="alpha">
        <strong>
            New:
        </strong>
    </div>
    New tags usually indicate the version in which they were added to
    the program.

<div class="indent1">
    <div class="alpha">
        <strong>
            Updated:
        </strong>
    </div>
    Updated tags also indicate the version in which they were
    updated.
</div>
<div class="indent1">
    <div class="alpha">
        <strong>
            Deprecated:
        </strong>
    </div>
    Deprecated tags are scheduled to be removed from the program.
    Deprecated tags should still parse and work as they did before but
    will not in future versions. Deprecated tag entries should indicate
    the tag that replaces it.
