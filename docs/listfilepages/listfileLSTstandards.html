<h1>Official Release LST standards</h1>
<p>Guidelines for Official Release source submissions.</p>
<p>Please put [SUBMIT] in the subject line when emailing the team
with submissions issues.</p>
<p><strong>RULE 1</strong>: Be true to the Source Product (i.e. do
not make any judgment calls). If the source doesn't say it, it
doesn't go in. It is better to leave incorrect or unclear
information out.</p>
<p><strong>RULE 2</strong>: Leave any calls about gray areas to the
PCGen Submission Team member.</p>
<p><strong>RULE 3</strong>: Mechanics are NOT to be described. If
the final result can be displayed, that is good, but no describing
the mechanics behind it on the character sheet.</p>
<p><strong>RULE 4:</strong> Capitalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>HARDCODE = ALLCAPS.</li>
<li>Defined in List files (GameMode or otherwise) =
ProperCase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|5|TYPE=MyType</code></p>
<p>BONUS, COMBAT, AC, and TYPE= are all hardcoded. MyType is
defined in the List file (because it just got added!)</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<code>VISIBLE:YES, VISIBLE:NO, VISIBLE:DISPLAY,
VISIBLE:EXPORT</code></p>
<p>YES, NO, DISPLAY, and EXPORT are the only valid values of the
VISIBLE tag.&nbsp; Since those values and what they do are
hardcoded into PCGen, they are done in ALLCAPS in the data
files.</p>
<h2>Basics:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Plain TEXT file, with a .LST ending for data files, or .PCC for
campaign files, instead of .txt<br />
Use Text editors, such as Wordpad (notepad sometimes has problems
with the length of the lines), UltraEdit, Textpad, vi, or ee.<br />
Microsoft Word has problems with formatting and layout of text, it
is not recommended to be used to create files.<br />
Some LST Monkeys use Excel, and export to a tab delimitated file,
which works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tabs between objects. No spaces before or after those tabs. Tab
should NEVER be the first character on a line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the first character is either a # (for comment) or a
name of the object being defined such as a TAG.<br />
Tabs and spaces are hard to see, and cause loading issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your text editor to 6 spaces per tab, as that is the
standard for columnizing the files.</p>
</li>
<li>Comments on ANYTHING you are unsure about, or haven't been able
to implement correctly.<br />
Comments are always done on their own line, and start with #.<br />
<ul>
<li>If you have a suggestion on how to do something, but not
totally sure, include that.</li>
<li>If you have a suggestion on how to do something that would
require some code changes, comment on that.<br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comment line at top of LST files: # Original Entry by: &lt;your
name&gt;.<br />
You want credit for the hard work you've done, right?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ogl">OGL Compliance</h2>
<p>The Open Game License (OGL) is a royalty free copyright license
developed by Wizards of the Coast. The OGL has revitalized the RPG
industry by creating a way for third party publishers to easily
create and publish material they might not otherwise be free to.
Publishers use the OGL to release Open Game Content (OGC) which can
be used by other publishers seeking publish content based on the
original publishers work. Open Game Content is any material that is
distributed using the Open Game License clearly identified by the
publisher as Open Game Content.</p>
<p>You can read the OGL <a href=
"../acknowledgments/ogllicense.html">here in our documentation</a>
or here at <a href=
"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/welcome">Wizards of the
Coast's web site</a> which contains additional information about
the OGL.</p>
<p>PCGen publishes its data via the OGL. As an OGL publisher we
have to insure that the data we publish complies in all respects
with the Open Game License. All data is reviewed for OGL Compliance
before being entered into the project data files.</p>
<p>At this time we only publish Open Game Content. Though not
required by the OGL, PCGen also seeks permission from publishers
before including their data in our releases.</p>
<h2>OGC vs. Product Identity:</h2>
<p><strong>OGC</strong>: For OGL sources, OGC is declared somewhere
in the book. It is usually on the title/copyright page (front of
book) or the OGL page (usually in the very back). Including that
declaration in a separate file with your submission will greatly
speed its inclusion into PCGen, since it will give us a quick way
of verifying Product Identity to ensure compliance with the OGL on
our part.</p>
<p><strong>Product Identity</strong>: For names of objects, use the
NAMEISPI:YES tag in your submission. For a first submission, please
do not include any other Product Identity unless you have discussed
it with a PCGen Submission Team member. If you receive a go ahead,
follow the restrictions set by it down to the letter.</p>
<h2>Other Topics:</h2>
<h3>Copyright (in PCC)</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ONLY and EXACTLY what is in the Sec. 15 of the OGL.
<strong>VERBATIM</strong>.<br />
If there are Typos, leave them in.&nbsp; Weird characters, leave
them in.&nbsp; Stupid comments, leave them in.<br />
Including a scanned page from the book with your submission would
be nice but not completely necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>List each source mentioned in the Section 15 in its own
COPYRIGHT tag line - see Cityscape files (by Battlefield Press) for
a superb example.</li>
</ol>
<h3>General Object Naming Standards</h3>
<p>These are general rules for the naming of classes, feats, races
and other objects.</p>
<p>Characters approved for use in object names are: upper and lower
case letters, numbers, single spaces in between multiple words
(never before or after) and the following glyphs: underscore (_),
dash (-), apostrophe ('), parentheses (), slash (/), and a tilde
(~).</p>
<p>Characters which should never be used in object names are Commas
(,), Pipes (|), Backslashes (\), Colons (:), Semicolons (;),
Periods (.), Brackets ([]), Percent (%), Asterisk (*) and Equals
(=).</p>
<p>Two words separated by a dash should both be capitalized.</p>
<p>If the name of the object must be different from the source (due
to commas or math symbols in the name or other reasons), an
OUTPUTNAME: tag with the EXACT name must be included.</p>
<p>Potions should be listed as Potion (&lt;name&gt;) with
OUTPUTNAME:Potion of [NAME] unless the source lists it as otherwise
(see part 1 for rules to follow in that case). Poisons, Rods,
Staffs, Wands and same way as Potions.</p>
<p>Within these limits the name should be as close as possible to
the published source.</p>
<h3>Additional Restrictions</h3>
<p>No object may be named a valid number (even 0x45 or 1e20 could
be a problem) as items with optional count can fail.</p>
<p>No object may be called "ANY" or "ALL" or "LIST".</p>
<p>No Class may be called "HIGHESTLEVELCLASS".</p>
<p>No Equipment may be called "Total".</p>
<p>No Weaponprof may be called "DEITYWEAPON".</p>
<p>No equipment (or eqmod ITYPE) may use the types "ADD" or
"REMOVE".</p>
<h3>General EQMOD Naming Standards</h3>
<p>EQMOD keys are to be in all capital letters and may only contain
letters, numbers and underscores ("_").</p>
<p>Each word should be separated by an underscore character for
ease in reading.</p>
<p>For purposes of abbreviation the letter limit on the first and
second sections of the Key name is 8 and 7.</p>
<p>EQMODs for different item types (Weapon vs. Armor for example)
will be done as separate EQMODs.</p>
<p>Materials which list different pricing for different item types
or sub types (Light Armor vs. Medium Armor for example) will be
done as separate EQMODs for each price type.</p>
<h3>File names</h3>
<p>LST file names for PCGen follow a certain naming conventions.
You should use all lowercase letters in the file name. The first
part of any file will be a short version of the source name, for
example if the source is named 'The Foo Handbook' we can shorten it
to foohandbook or even fhb. The source name will be followed by
words indicating what type of objects the file contains. These
words are separated an underscore (_) symbol. Using our example
here are some names for a typical source. These are not required
but it does help to quickly identify the contents of the file. This
list is incomplete but should give you a good idea of how you
should name your files as well as how you should divide up the
contents of your dataset. Take a look at other sources that come
with PCGen for more examples.</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb.pcc</code> - loads all the LST
files</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_classes_base.lst</code> - Contains
base classes</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_classes_prestige.lst</code> - Contains
prestige classes</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_companionmods.lst</code> - Contains
companion mods</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_deities.lst</code> - Contains
deities</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_domains.lst</code> - Contains
domains</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_equip.lst</code> - Contains general
equipment</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_equipmods.lst</code> - Contains
equipment mods</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_feats.lst</code> - Contains feats</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_feats_hidden.lst</code> - Contains
hidden feats</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_equip_armorshields.lst</code> -
Contains armor and shields</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_equip_armorshields_specific.lst</code>
- Contains specific kinds of armor and shields, magical,
extraordinary, etc..</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_equip_equip_weap_melee.lst</code> -
Contains melee weapons</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_equip_equip_weap_ranged.lst</code> -
Contains ranged weapons</p>
<p class="indent1"><code>fhb_equip_wondrousitems.lst</code> -
Contains wondrous items</p>
<h3>SOURCELONG, SOURCESHORT, SOURCEWEB, SOURCEPAGE</h3>
<p>SOURCELONG, SOURCESHORT, and SOURCEWEB are defined in both the
PCC and the top of the LST files. These can easily be changed by
the submission team, so do not feel bad if they are. <b>Note:</b>
Prior to version 5.10 SOURCE header tags were grouped in a single
block separated with pipe (|) symbols. This has been changed to
allow for easier parsing, SOURCE header tags should still be put on
one line at the top of the file but should be separated by tabs
instead of pipes.</p>
<p>Formats should be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SOURCELONG</strong>:&lt;name of publisher&gt; -
[&lt;name of product group, if any&gt; - ] &lt;name of product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOURCESHORT</strong>:&lt;10 letter or less abbreviation
of the name of the product&gt;<br />
Leave the first name of the product whole, if possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOURCEWEB</strong>:http://&lt;web address of publisher,
or product group if the publisher has a page for that&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOURCEPAGE</strong> is done on object lines.<br />
Use the first page the object is described (so if a class is
defined on pages 51-54, the tag would read SOURCEPAGE:p.51)<br />
Format should be SOURCEPAGE:p.#</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="STDSPELLNAME" id="STDSPELLNAME">Standard Spellbook
Names</a></h3>
<p>Spellbook names for the <code>SPELLS</code> tags are used to
identify the source of a Spell Like Ability (SLA). The Spellbook is
the first variable in the SPELLS tag, in the following example
"innate" is the name of the spellbook.</p>
<p><code>SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=5|TIMEUNIT=Week|Wall of
Stone</code></p>
<p>Using the word "Class" or "Race" alone as a spellbook name
creates a problem within PCGen. The standard convention is to use
one of three spellbook names to indicate the origin of the
spell-like ability.</p>
<ol class="indent1">
<li><strong>Innate</strong> - For racial and template acquired
SLA's<br />
If it comes from a race, the race name (Gnome, etc)<br />
<br /></li>
<li><strong>Class Ability</strong> - For SLA's derived from
classes.<br />
If it comes from a class, the class name (Sentinel, Paladin,
etc)<br />
<br /></li>
<li><strong>Magic Item</strong> - For SLA's provided by
equipment.<br />
If it comes from an magic item, the item name (Belt of Magic
Spells, etc)<br />
<br /></li>
</ol>
<h3>SAB (formerly SA)</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Name ONLY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type of Special ability in Parentheses only if mentioned in
Source: (Ex) (Su) (Sp) etc. If not mentioned, don't put one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a Dynamic formula, and the formula can be
calculated, it can be included, but no Formulas described.<br />
See Monk Stun, and Dragon SA's. If it has a static range (like 10'
no matter what) then that should not be listed.<br />
The user will need to own the source in that case. The dynamic
formulas should be done via DEFINE/BONUS:VAR tags.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>DESC (Feats, Spells, Deities, Domains)</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check for Open Game Content.&nbsp; If the DESC (see below for
what to look for) is not OGC, leave as DESC:See text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If OGC, for Feats: Use only a 1 line description w/o mechanics.
This is best by grabbing the "flavor" line after the feat name but
before the "Benefits" or mechanics portion of the feat. This is
usually before any prerequisites are listed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If OGC, for Spells: Use only a 1 line description that comes
with the class spell lists. Some sources have a purely descriptive
element for the Spells that are NOT OGC. Consulting with the
publisher (and getting permission for the IP/PI) is for the PCGen
Submissions Team. Please leave those with See Text, and when
submitting the files, include a file with comments such as this, so
we know where we stand, and can progress with acquiring permission
for the PI or leaving it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If permission is granted for closed content PI by the publisher
(submission team will inform you if so), then the DESC can be
filled in with the same rules as above, but a DESCISPI:YES tag must
also be added.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>DEFINE/BONUS:VAR and Variable Naming Standards</h3>
<p>These two tags are used to track variables across different
objects.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Variables syntax should start with a letter and should be
composed of only letters, _ and numbers (no spaces). The standard
Convention is to use only letters, capitalizing individual words
for readability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full words where possible (no over compressing to the point
where it isn't readily understandable to what you are referring
to).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please use formulas where possible. Such as CL=Name in for class
abilities. 1 Bonus statement with a formula is processed faster
than a BONUS statement on every class line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where it is possible to do so there should be only one DEFINE
statement per variable and the DEFINE should be set at 0 with a
BONUS:VAR used to adjust the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable names in all capitals are reserved for hard coded
variables or variables defined within the system files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where it is possible to do so variables should be DEFINEd within
the parent object where it is first used or encountered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is good practice to leave comments within the data sets LST
code explaining what variables have been used in the set, what
their purpose is and how they are to be used.</p>
<h3>DR / Damage Reduction</h3>
<p>This tag is used to track Damage Reduction. Recent Code
enchantments compare different DRs, and list only the highest per
type. This requires some standardization in how DR is coded up, to
ensure items are being compared properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Types of DR (after the /) are in Proper Case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerical DR, as used in 3.0 format is +#</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DR that has no bypass is listed as -</p>
</li>
<li>Several Key names are used across the datasets.
<ul>
<li>+1, +2, +3, +4, +5</li>
<li>Silver, Adamantine, Cold Iron</li>
<li>Magic, Epic</li>
<li>Lawful, Chaotic, Good, Evil</li>
<li>Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Ballistic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use ' and ' and ' or ' between types in the same DR tag.
<ul>
<li>Bludgeoning or Piercing</li>
<li>Magic and Silver</li>
<li>Epic and Evil</li>
<li>Good or Silver</li>
<li>Cold Iron or Good</li>
<li>Lawful or Good</li>
<li>Bludgeoning and Magic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
