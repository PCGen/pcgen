   Welcome to the LST File Class on Companion_Mod
creation and editing. In this class we cover the basics tags
required to make a complete companion_mod file and how the file
works. As in all things, this is a small part of the whole, PCGen
works in many parts - Which is why I cover two tags not part of
this file, but must be included to get the "bigger picture".
  </p>
  <h4>
   Style Guide
  </h4>
  <p>
   This LST File Class follows the
   <a href="lfc_style_guide.html">
    LST File Class Style Guide
   </a>
   .

  <h2>
   SECTION 1: How to Create Your Own Companions
  </h2>
  <p class="indent0">
   There may come a time when you want to make your
own special companion which doesn't match the rules. That's okay.
Setting up a new companion with different powers or grants
different bonuses to the master is acceptable. That is what this
section is here for, to guide you through the process of making
your companion - be it a Special Familiar, a War mount or anything
else you might want.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   So without further adieu...
  </p>
  <h3>
   Sample Sly Slink Companion
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   I have a creature that when I gain have 3
levels, grants me a +2 to my Hide Skill; at 5th level I can use
Shadow Walk once per day. It also gains 3 hit dice when I reach 3rd
and 5th.. Sly Slink is only available as a Shadow Ferret.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h3>
   Required Tags
  </h3>
  <h4>
   FOLLOWER
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   The first tag we're going to look at is
   <span class="lstobj">
    FOLLOWER
   </span>
   , each line generally starts
with the Follower tag.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Think of the Follower as sort of a class Tag
telling the program what "level" things happen at. So like we have
Class Level Lines to tell PCGen what is applied at that level and
lower so to do we have a tag called
   <code>FOLLOWER</code>
   which
acts in much the same way.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>FOLLOWER:MonkeyFu=1</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   The Follower tag can take variables or Class
names. So if MonkeyFu is a Class then you need to have the first
level to qualify, however, MonkeyFu is a variable, so you need to
have this variable of at least 1 to obtain the rest of the benefits
derived from the rest of the line.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>FOLLOWER:Paladin=1</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   You need to have 1 level in paladin class.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>FOLLOWER:MagicItem=1</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   You need to have 1 in a variable name called
MagicItem
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   TYPE
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   The second and VERY important tag is
   <code>TYPE</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Type tells pcgen what applies to this line. The
ones used commonly in PCGen's main sets are: Familiar, Animal
Companion, Special Mount, Mount and Follower.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Any Creature meeting that "TYPE" will have the
benefits applied to them. Simply put without a TYPE PCGen won't be
able to able the changes you code up. TYPE has to match exactly the
name from
   <code>COMPANIONLIST</code>
   . Think of TYPE as a Group as
it groups things together, so with that frame of mind, Familiar is
a group, as is Special Mount.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Example of a Familiar:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:Familiar|Bat,Cat</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   Bat and Cat are both of the Familiar TYPE or
group.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h3>
   Miscelaneous Tags
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   You can use any Tags that are appropriate for
your Companion.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   The following tags are commonly use on the
Follower Line.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   COPYMASTERBAB
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This tag identifies the companion's Base Attack
Bonus (BAB) progression and can be set to that of its master, by
using the
   <code>MASTER</code>
   parameter, or you may use a number,
variable or formula.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   So, if you want your companion to either follow
the Master PC's BAB progression you would use the following
tag:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COPYMASTERBAB:MASTER</code>
   (Common for
familiars)
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   If you wanted to set the companion's BAB to
%quot;5%quot; no mater what level the master is, you would use the
following tag:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COPYMASTERBAB:5</code>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   COPYMASTERCHECK:MASTER
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   That's it, this only copies the Master's Base
Checks (Commonly Fortitude, Reflex and Will) The creature will use
it's Stats to modify the base though (Common for Familiar)
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COPYMASTERCHECK:MASTER</code>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   FOLLOWERADJUSTMENT
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This is used appended to the COMPANIONLIST tag.
COMPANIONLIST is a Tag that is not used in a companion mod file.
However, it is important to mention it's uses as it pertains to the
companionmod file.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Example from the docs
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:Animal
Companion|Ape|FOLLOWERADJUSTMENT:-3</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   An Ape companion to a 4th level Druid gains the
benefits normally granted to a companion of a 1st level Druid.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   HD
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This will grant bonus Hit Die of the creature
type.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>HD:5</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   Will grant 5 bonus Hit Die (Or class levels) of
the creatures type (The Creature TYPE is called RACETYPE and
normally follows the standard choices. The RACETYPE can be changed
inside the CompanionMod lst file any bonus HD will use that Race
Type. If the Creature is Fey it will gain the HD and class benefits
of being 5 HD stronger
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   NOTE: The base creature can exceed the maximum
HD cap for its race in this manner.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   MASTERBONUSRACE
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   Sets any special bonuses a particular race or
creature may grant to the master (Common for familiar).
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Common tags to follow this are BONUS and
VFEAT.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   The uses of this tag are not to be
underestimated, with this tag you can grant a level dependent bonus
to the master at a certain level.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Bat &lt;TAB&gt;
BONUS:SKILL|Spot|3</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   Would give the master +3 bonus to Spot checks if
he has a Bat.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Bat &lt;TAB&gt;
BONUS:VAR|MyCoolVar|3|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   At 10th level the Master of this Bat gets 3 to
his 'MyCoolVar' which can be attached to a feat, ability, or even
an item with a Variable in the SPROP.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Magic Item - Sword
&lt;TAB&gt;
BONUS:VAR|MagicWeaponPlusIncrease|2|PREVARGTEQ:MagicItem,1</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   This will grant two (2) to the varaible
MagicWeaponPlusIncrease when the PREVAR requirements are met.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   RACETYPE
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This tag will change the base creature's type to
the one listed. RACETYPE affects the Bonus HD and progression of
the creature.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>RACETYPE:Fey</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   The creature now has the Fey Type which replaces
its previous RACETYPE as assigned by the race file.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   USEMASTERSKILL
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   Determines whether the creature will have the
exact same skill ranks as the master.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Your choices are
   <code>YES</code>
   and
   <code>NO</code>
   (Default).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>USEMASTERSKILL:YES</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   Creature will have the exact same ranks in the
skills chosen by the master.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   BONUS:FOLLOWERS
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   Although this tag is not used in a
   <span class="lstfile">
    companionmods.lst
   </span>
   file, it does deserve mention in
this class.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   The
   <code>BONUS:FOLLOWER</code>
   tag is what
allows us to actually gain a creature in a particular TYPE or
group. Without it you won't be able to select or add any creatures
from that TYPE or group. This needs to match the
   <code>COMPANIONLIST</code>
   definition, which is seen as the
companion type inside our actual file.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   The following line will be found in your
non-companion mod lst file (e.g.
   <span class="lstfile">
    class.lst
   </span>
   ,
   <span class="lstfile">
    feat.lst
   </span>
   ,
   <span class="lstfile">
    race.lst
   </span>
   ,
   <span class="lstfile">
    template.lst
   </span>
   , etc.)
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>BONUS:FOLLOWERS|
    <b>
     Familiar
    </b>
    |1</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   You can gain one (1) Familiar
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   The following line is the corresponding line in
the
   <span class="lstfile">
    companionmod.lst
   </span>
   :
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>FOLLOWER:Whatever=1 &lt;TAB&gt;
TYPE:
    <b>
     Familiar
    </b></code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:
    <b>
     Familiar
    </b>
    |Foo</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Notice the pattern, if you don't match those
exactly you won't get access to that TYPE or group. I bolded the
entries for you to see what must match.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h3>
   Putting it All Together
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   Okay, lets put together the sample critter
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Remember the sample from the begining? "I have a
creature that when I gain have 3 levels, grants me a +2 to my Hide
Skill; at 5th level I can use Shadow Walk once per day. It also
gains 3 hit dice when I reach 3rd and 5th. Sly Slink is only
available as a Shadow Ferret.". Well we are going to make that into
something PCGen understands.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="indent1">
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:SlySlinkLvl=3 &lt;TAB&gt;
TYPE:Sly Slink &lt;TAB&gt; HD:3</code>
   </p>
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:SlySlinkLvl=5 &lt;TAB&gt;
TYPE:Sly Slink &lt;TAB&gt; HD:3</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="indent1">
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Shadow Ferret
&lt;TAB&gt; TYPE:Sly Slink &lt;TAB&gt;
BONUS:SKILL|Hide|2|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=3 &lt;TAB&gt; SAB:use Shadow Walk
once per day|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=5</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent0">
   In an ability or somewhere else you would need
this:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="indent1">
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>FOLLOWERS:Sly Slink|1 &lt;TAB&gt;
COMPANIONLIST:Sly Slink|Shadow Ferret &lt;TAB&gt;
DEFINE:SlySlinkLvl|0 &lt;TAB&gt;
BONUS:VAR|SlySlinkLvl|TL</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent0">
   Okay, lets put together another sample
critter
  </p>
  <blockquote class="indent1">
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:Monkey Warrior=1 &lt;TAB&gt;
HD:5 &lt;TAB&gt; TYPE:Monkey Mount &lt;TAB&gt; ABILITY:Special
Ability|AUTOMATIC|Dodging Foo|Nasty Breath &lt;TAB&gt;
RACETYPE:Dragon &lt;TAB&gt; USEMASTERSKILL:YES</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent2">
   Okay Class, I threw a few curve balls in there.
As a 1st level Monkey Warrior,
   <code>FOLLOWER:Monkey
Warrior=1</code>
   , my critter of the Monkey Mount type,
   <code>TYPE:Monkey Mount</code>
   , will become a Dragon race type,
   <code>RACETYPE:Dragon</code>
   . It will use my skill rank selection,
   <code>USEMASTERSKILL:YES</code>
   , and get the special abilities of
Dodging Foo and Nasty Breath,
   <code>ABILITY:Special
Ability|AUTOMATIC|Dodging Foo|Nasty Breath</code>
   , as automatic
abilities.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>FOLLOWER:Monkey Warrior=5 &lt;TAB&gt; HD:5
&lt;TAB&gt; SR:12+HD</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   When Monkey Warrior becomes 5th level, my
critter will gain another 5 bonus hit die and gain Spell Resistance
of 12 + it's HD.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   This is showing you what is possible in your own
Companion Mod file.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Now, we shouldn't leave you at this... You need
to place the COMPANIONLIST tag somewhere outside this file, either
a feat, ability, template or even inside a class, and with the tag
you choose what creatures belong in the Monkey Mount (TYPE) or
group.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:Monkey Mount|Wolf,Fuzzy
Bear</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   That would make a Wolf and Fuzzy Bear part of
the Monkey Mount (TYPE) or group.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:Monkey
Mount|Bat|FOLLOWERADJUSTMENT:-5</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   If my Monkey Warrior takes a bat companion he
needs to be 6th level before the 1st level effect takes place and
then 10th level for the level 5 effect. The '-5' means the creature
in that grouping will act as if five (5) levels lower, this works
regardless of Class or Variable. Druid Class in the SRD and RSRD
makes a great example of this case.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Now an advanced technique for those that feel
they understand this.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:Intelligent Item|Intelligent
Weapon - Longsword</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>BONUS:FOLLOWERS|Intelligent
Item|1</code>
  </p>
  <blockquote class="indent1">
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Intelligent Weapon -
Longsword &lt;TAB&gt; BONUS:SKILL|Move Silently|5|TYPE=Competence
&lt;TAB&gt; AUTO:FEAT|Weapon Focus(Longsword) &lt;TAB&gt;
BONUS:VAR|WeaponPlusIncrease|1|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent0">
   Can you figure it out? If I have the Intelligent
Weapon - Longsword I'll get a plus five (+5) competence bonus to
Move Silently, Weapon Focus for the Longsword as an Automatic Feat
and when I attain a total character level of eight (8th level) I
will get plus one (+1) to the variable name 'WeaponPlusIncrease'.
Were you able to follow that? If not, it's okay, this can become
complex quickly.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Okay, that should get you on the path of
Companion Mod file creation. In the next section we discuss
applications of adding and modifying the Companion List.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
   SECTION 2: Modifying Companion Lists
  </h2>
  <p class="indent0">
   It always happens, either through a feat, new
power or just a whim. Regardless of the source, there may come a
time when you wish to add to the list of available critters to a
certain class or group.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST</code>
   is additive. A good
example of this case is Improved Familiar.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:Familiar|Shocker
Lizard,Stirge|PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=5</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   This will grant the Shocker Lizard and Stirge to
the available list in the Familiar (TYPE) if the master is an
Arcane Spell Caster of 5th level or higher.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>COMPANIONLIST:Monkey Mount|Sand
Shark</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   This will grant the Sand Shark to the available
list in the Monkey Mount (TYPE) group.
