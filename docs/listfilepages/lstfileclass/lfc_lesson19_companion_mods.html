<p class="indent0">
    Welcome to the LST File Class on Companion_Mod
    creation and editing. In this class we cover the basics tags
    required to make a complete companion_mod file and how the file
    works. As in all things, this is a small part of the whole, PCGen
    works in many parts - Which is why I cover two tags not part of
    this file, but must be included to get the "bigger picture".
</p>
<h4>
    Style Guide
</h4>
<p>
    This LST File Class follows the
    <a href="lfc_style_guide.html">
        LST File Class Style Guide
    </a>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
    SECTION 1: How to Create Your Own Companions
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
    There may come a time when you want to make your
    own special companion which doesn't match the rules. That's okay.
    Setting up a new companion with different powers or grants
    different bonuses to the master is acceptable. That is what this
    section is here for, to guide you through the process of making
    your companion - be it a Special Familiar, a War mount or anything
    else you might want.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    So without further adieu...
</p>
<h3>
    Sample Sly Slink Companion
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    I have a creature that when I gain have 3
    levels, grants me a +2 to my Hide Skill; at 5th level I can use
    Shadow Walk once per day. It also gains 3 hit dice when I reach 3rd
    and 5th.. Sly Slink is only available as a Shadow Ferret.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>
    Required Tags
</h3>
<h4>
    FOLLOWER
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    The first tag we're going to look at is
    <span class="lstobj">
    FOLLOWER
   </span>
    , each line generally starts
    with the Follower tag.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Think of the Follower as sort of a class Tag
    telling the program what "level" things happen at. So like we have
    Class Level Lines to tell PCGen what is applied at that level and
    lower so to do we have a tag called
    <code>FOLLOWER</code>
    which
    acts in much the same way.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:MonkeyFu=1</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    The Follower tag can take variables or Class
    names. So if MonkeyFu is a Class then you need to have the first
    level to qualify, however, MonkeyFu is a variable, so you need to
    have this variable of at least 1 to obtain the rest of the benefits
    derived from the rest of the line.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:Paladin=1</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    You need to have 1 level in paladin class.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:MagicItem=1</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    You need to have 1 in a variable name called
    MagicItem
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    TYPE
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    The second and VERY important tag is
    <code>TYPE</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Type tells pcgen what applies to this line. The
    ones used commonly in PCGen's main sets are: Familiar, Animal
    Companion, Special Mount, Mount and Follower.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Any Creature meeting that "TYPE" will have the
    benefits applied to them. Simply put without a TYPE PCGen won't be
    able to able the changes you code up. TYPE has to match exactly the
    name from
    <code>COMPANIONLIST</code>
    . Think of TYPE as a Group as
    it groups things together, so with that frame of mind, Familiar is
    a group, as is Special Mount.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Example of a Familiar:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:Familiar|Bat,Cat</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    Bat and Cat are both of the Familiar TYPE or
    group.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>
    Miscelaneous Tags
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    You can use any Tags that are appropriate for
    your Companion.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The following tags are commonly use on the
    Follower Line.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    COPYMASTERBAB
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag identifies the companion's Base Attack
    Bonus (BAB) progression and can be set to that of its master, by
    using the
    <code>MASTER</code>
    parameter, or you may use a number,
    variable or formula.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    So, if you want your companion to either follow
    the Master PC's BAB progression you would use the following
    tag:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COPYMASTERBAB:MASTER</code>
    (Common for
    familiars)
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    If you wanted to set the companion's BAB to
    %quot;5%quot; no mater what level the master is, you would use the
    following tag:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COPYMASTERBAB:5</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    COPYMASTERCHECK:MASTER
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    That's it, this only copies the Master's Base
    Checks (Commonly Fortitude, Reflex and Will) The creature will use
    it's Stats to modify the base though (Common for Familiar)
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COPYMASTERCHECK:MASTER</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    FOLLOWERADJUSTMENT
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This is used appended to the COMPANIONLIST tag.
    COMPANIONLIST is a Tag that is not used in a companion mod file.
    However, it is important to mention it's uses as it pertains to the
    companionmod file.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Example from the docs
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:Animal
        Companion|Ape|FOLLOWERADJUSTMENT:-3</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    An Ape companion to a 4th level Druid gains the
    benefits normally granted to a companion of a 1st level Druid.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    HD
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This will grant bonus Hit Die of the creature
    type.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>HD:5</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    Will grant 5 bonus Hit Die (Or class levels) of
    the creatures type (The Creature TYPE is called RACETYPE and
    normally follows the standard choices. The RACETYPE can be changed
    inside the CompanionMod lst file any bonus HD will use that Race
    Type. If the Creature is Fey it will gain the HD and class benefits
    of being 5 HD stronger
</p>
<p class="sidebar1">
    NOTE: The base creature can exceed the maximum
    HD cap for its race in this manner.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    MASTERBONUSRACE
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    Sets any special bonuses a particular race or
    creature may grant to the master (Common for familiar).
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Common tags to follow this are BONUS and
    VFEAT.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The uses of this tag are not to be
    underestimated, with this tag you can grant a level dependent bonus
    to the master at a certain level.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Bat &lt;TAB&gt;
        BONUS:SKILL|Spot|3</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    Would give the master +3 bonus to Spot checks if
    he has a Bat.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Bat &lt;TAB&gt;
        BONUS:VAR|MyCoolVar|3|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    At 10th level the Master of this Bat gets 3 to
    his 'MyCoolVar' which can be attached to a feat, ability, or even
    an item with a Variable in the SPROP.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Magic Item - Sword
        &lt;TAB&gt;
        BONUS:VAR|MagicWeaponPlusIncrease|2|PREVARGTEQ:MagicItem,1</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    This will grant two (2) to the varaible
    MagicWeaponPlusIncrease when the PREVAR requirements are met.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    RACETYPE
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag will change the base creature's type to
    the one listed. RACETYPE affects the Bonus HD and progression of
    the creature.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>RACETYPE:Fey</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    The creature now has the Fey Type which replaces
    its previous RACETYPE as assigned by the race file.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    USEMASTERSKILL
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    Determines whether the creature will have the
    exact same skill ranks as the master.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Your choices are
    <code>YES</code>
    and
    <code>NO</code>
    (Default).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>USEMASTERSKILL:YES</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    Creature will have the exact same ranks in the
    skills chosen by the master.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    BONUS:FOLLOWERS
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    Although this tag is not used in a
    <span class="lstfile">
    companionmods.lst
   </span>
    file, it does deserve mention in
    this class.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <code>BONUS:FOLLOWER</code>
    tag is what
    allows us to actually gain a creature in a particular TYPE or
    group. Without it you won't be able to select or add any creatures
    from that TYPE or group. This needs to match the
    <code>COMPANIONLIST</code>
    definition, which is seen as the
    companion type inside our actual file.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The following line will be found in your
    non-companion mod lst file (e.g.
    <span class="lstfile">
    class.lst
   </span>
    ,
    <span class="lstfile">
    feat.lst
   </span>
    ,
    <span class="lstfile">
    race.lst
   </span>
    ,
    <span class="lstfile">
    template.lst
   </span>
    , etc.)
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>BONUS:FOLLOWERS|
        <b>
            Familiar
        </b>
        |1</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    You can gain one (1) Familiar
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The following line is the corresponding line in
    the
    <span class="lstfile">
    companionmod.lst
   </span>
    :
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:Whatever=1 &lt;TAB&gt;
        TYPE:
        <b>
            Familiar
        </b></code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
</p>
<p class="indent0">
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:
        <b>
            Familiar
        </b>
        |Foo</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Notice the pattern, if you don't match those
    exactly you won't get access to that TYPE or group. I bolded the
    entries for you to see what must match.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>
    Putting it All Together
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    Okay, lets put together the sample critter
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Remember the sample from the begining? "I have a
    creature that when I gain have 3 levels, grants me a +2 to my Hide
    Skill; at 5th level I can use Shadow Walk once per day. It also
    gains 3 hit dice when I reach 3rd and 5th. Sly Slink is only
    available as a Shadow Ferret.". Well we are going to make that into
    something PCGen understands.
</p>
<blockquote class="indent1">
    <p class="tagindent1">
        <code>FOLLOWER:SlySlinkLvl=3 &lt;TAB&gt;
            TYPE:Sly Slink &lt;TAB&gt; HD:3</code>
    </p>
    <p class="tagindent1">
        <code>FOLLOWER:SlySlinkLvl=5 &lt;TAB&gt;
            TYPE:Sly Slink &lt;TAB&gt; HD:3</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="indent1">
    <p class="tagindent1">
        <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Shadow Ferret
            &lt;TAB&gt; TYPE:Sly Slink &lt;TAB&gt;
            BONUS:SKILL|Hide|2|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=3 &lt;TAB&gt; SAB:use Shadow Walk
            once per day|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=5</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent0">
    In an ability or somewhere else you would need
    this:
</p>
<blockquote class="indent1">
    <p class="tagindent1">
        <code>FOLLOWERS:Sly Slink|1 &lt;TAB&gt;
            COMPANIONLIST:Sly Slink|Shadow Ferret &lt;TAB&gt;
            DEFINE:SlySlinkLvl|0 &lt;TAB&gt;
            BONUS:VAR|SlySlinkLvl|TL</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent0">
    Okay, lets put together another sample
    critter
</p>
<blockquote class="indent1">
    <p class="tagindent1">
        <code>FOLLOWER:Monkey Warrior=1 &lt;TAB&gt;
            HD:5 &lt;TAB&gt; TYPE:Monkey Mount &lt;TAB&gt; ABILITY:Special
            Ability|AUTOMATIC|Dodging Foo|Nasty Breath &lt;TAB&gt;
            RACETYPE:Dragon &lt;TAB&gt; USEMASTERSKILL:YES</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent2">
    Okay Class, I threw a few curve balls in there.
    As a 1st level Monkey Warrior,
    <code>FOLLOWER:Monkey
        Warrior=1</code>
    , my critter of the Monkey Mount type,
    <code>TYPE:Monkey Mount</code>
    , will become a Dragon race type,
    <code>RACETYPE:Dragon</code>
    . It will use my skill rank selection,
    <code>USEMASTERSKILL:YES</code>
    , and get the special abilities of
    Dodging Foo and Nasty Breath,
    <code>ABILITY:Special
        Ability|AUTOMATIC|Dodging Foo|Nasty Breath</code>
    , as automatic
    abilities.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>FOLLOWER:Monkey Warrior=5 &lt;TAB&gt; HD:5
        &lt;TAB&gt; SR:12+HD</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    When Monkey Warrior becomes 5th level, my
    critter will gain another 5 bonus hit die and gain Spell Resistance
    of 12 + it's HD.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This is showing you what is possible in your own
    Companion Mod file.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Now, we shouldn't leave you at this... You need
    to place the COMPANIONLIST tag somewhere outside this file, either
    a feat, ability, template or even inside a class, and with the tag
    you choose what creatures belong in the Monkey Mount (TYPE) or
    group.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:Monkey Mount|Wolf,Fuzzy
        Bear</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    That would make a Wolf and Fuzzy Bear part of
    the Monkey Mount (TYPE) or group.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:Monkey
        Mount|Bat|FOLLOWERADJUSTMENT:-5</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    If my Monkey Warrior takes a bat companion he
    needs to be 6th level before the 1st level effect takes place and
    then 10th level for the level 5 effect. The '-5' means the creature
    in that grouping will act as if five (5) levels lower, this works
    regardless of Class or Variable. Druid Class in the SRD and RSRD
    makes a great example of this case.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Now an advanced technique for those that feel
    they understand this.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:Intelligent Item|Intelligent
        Weapon - Longsword</code>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>BONUS:FOLLOWERS|Intelligent
        Item|1</code>
</p>
<blockquote class="indent1">
    <p class="tagindent1">
        <code>MASTERBONUSRACE:Intelligent Weapon -
            Longsword &lt;TAB&gt; BONUS:SKILL|Move Silently|5|TYPE=Competence
            &lt;TAB&gt; AUTO:FEAT|Weapon Focus(Longsword) &lt;TAB&gt;
            BONUS:VAR|WeaponPlusIncrease|1|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent0">
    Can you figure it out? If I have the Intelligent
    Weapon - Longsword I'll get a plus five (+5) competence bonus to
    Move Silently, Weapon Focus for the Longsword as an Automatic Feat
    and when I attain a total character level of eight (8th level) I
    will get plus one (+1) to the variable name 'WeaponPlusIncrease'.
    Were you able to follow that? If not, it's okay, this can become
    complex quickly.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Okay, that should get you on the path of
    Companion Mod file creation. In the next section we discuss
    applications of adding and modifying the Companion List.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
    SECTION 2: Modifying Companion Lists
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
    It always happens, either through a feat, new
    power or just a whim. Regardless of the source, there may come a
    time when you wish to add to the list of available critters to a
    certain class or group.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST</code>
    is additive. A good
    example of this case is Improved Familiar.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:Familiar|Shocker
        Lizard,Stirge|PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=5</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This will grant the Shocker Lizard and Stirge to
    the available list in the Familiar (TYPE) if the master is an
    Arcane Spell Caster of 5th level or higher.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>COMPANIONLIST:Monkey Mount|Sand
        Shark</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This will grant the Sand Shark to the available
    list in the Monkey Mount (TYPE) group.
