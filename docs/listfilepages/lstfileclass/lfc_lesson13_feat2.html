    This tutorial will cover the use of prerequisite
    tags (which we refer to as PRExxx tags in general) in feats as they
    relate to actually qualifying for the feat. They may also be used
    to limit the application of the benefits of the feat, but that
    usage will be discussed in the tutorial on the BONUS tags at a
    later time.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    As with the CHOOSE tag from the previous
    tutorial, there are *many* PRExxx tags. I will cover some of the
    ones I believe you might commonly see/use, but for a full listing
    and syntax rules, you should browse the PRExxx section of the
    documentation included with PCGen.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    A few general notes in regards to using PRExxx
    tags in feats:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    1) To be a feat PRExxx (used to qualify you to
    actually take the feat itself) it must *not* be attached to another
    tag.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    2) You may put as many PRExxx tags on a feat
    line as you want and *all* must be met before the feat can be taken
    (unless the feat is granted by a tag that allows the user to bypass
    PRExxx tags, such as the VFEAT tag).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    3) You may use PRExxx attached to other tags
    within the feat to control what bonuses are applied and where and
    when, but they will not be used in the determination of whether or
    not you can take the feat itself. While VFEAT will bypass PRExxx
    tags for the taking of the feat, the ones attached to other tag
    will still be active.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    4) The general format of a PRExxx tag is either
    PRExxx:#,y=z,y=z for those that compare something to a number or
    PRExxx:#,z,z for those that do not compare to a number.; The #
    determines how many of the y=z pairs (or z specs) you must qualify
    for to be considered as having met the prereq. Although, as with
    almost everything in life, there are exceptions.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    5) In the documentation, some of these tags are
    referred to as "Global". This means that they are supposed to work
    in any file type (feat, template, spell, etc.) *NOT* that they will
    work with any tag. This is an important distinction. If a tag is
    not documented as being able to have PRExxx tags applied, then it
    most likely will not function if you try to do so.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    6) When a PRExxx tag is doing a comparison with
    a number, it is assumed to be met if equal to or greater than in
    most instances. Those tags that do not function this way have
    suffixes (explained further below) that modify the comparison
    behavior.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    7) Any PRExxx tag may be prefixed with a "!"
    character (!PRExxx) in order to invert the requirement. The PRExxx
    tag will be evaluated as normal, then the result reversed (meaning
    you CAN NOT have the things listed in this tag) when determining
    whether the prerequisite is passed or not.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        EQ, NEQ, GT, LT, GTEQ, LTEQ
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    There are several tags that do comparisons other
    than the normal "greater than or equal to" that is the standard. In
    these cases there are suffixes that get attached to the tag to tell
    it what type of comparison is desired to make it evaluate as true.
    Those tags that these suffixes go with will not function without
    them, so make sure and note which tags use them.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The suffixes and their meanings are:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        EQ - &gt; Equal
        <br/>
        NEQ -&gt; Not Equal
        <br/>
        LT -&gt; Less Than
        <br/>
        LTEQ -&gt; Less Than or Equal
        <br/>
        GT -&gt; Greater Than
        <br/>
        GTEQ -&gt; Greater Than or Equal
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent1">
    So when in use you would basically see "&lt;base
    tag&gt;EQ" or "&lt;base tag&gt;LTEQ:", and that is the condition
    that must be satisfied for that PRExxx tag to be evaluated to
    true.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    I will note which tags take these suffixes when
    I cover them below.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PREALIGN
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag is one of the exceptions mentioned
    above to the standard PRExxx format rule. This one takes the format
    of PREALIGN:&lt;align1&gt;,&lt;align2&gt;,etc. To pass this PRExxx
    you need only meet one of the listed criteria.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    You may use number or text representations for
    the alignments. The identifiers for the alignments are as
    follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        0 or LG = Lawful Good
        <br/>
        1 or LN = Lawful Neutral
        <br/>
        2 or LE = Lawful Evil
        <br/>
        3 or NG = Neutral Good
        <br/>
        4 or TN = True Neutral
        <br/>
        5 or NE = Neutral Evil
        <br/>
        6 or CG = Chaotic Good
        <br/>
        7 or CN = Chaotic Neutral
        <br/>
        8 or CE = Chaotic Evil
        <br/>
        9 or None = None
        <br/>
        10 or Deity = Deity's alignment
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREALIGN:LG,CG</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must be Lawful Good or Chaotic Good
    alignment
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREALIGN:Deity</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Character's alignment must match that of their
    chosen deity.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PREATT
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag checks the value of the characters Base
    Attack Bonus (the attack bonuses granted from class advancement and
    race). If the character's BAB is equal to or greater than the
    number given the PRExxx is met.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This is another tag that does not follow the
    standard format. It takes the form of PREATT:#.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREATT:3</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Characters BAB must be 3 or greater
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PRECHECK/PRECHECKBASE
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    These tags compare the value of the
    check(s)/saving throw(s) against the number(s) you supply in the
    tag and if the value of the check is equal to or higher than the
    prereq value given, the prereq is considered to be met.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The PRECHECKBASE compares the base save (defined
    in game play as the total from classes... in program terms, it will
    add in anything defined by BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.&lt;checkname&gt;|#).
    The PRECHECK compares the total (which would include bonuses from
    items, stats, etc.) of the check to the given number.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The check/save to be checked *must* be one of
    the ones defined in your gamemode files or the tag will fail.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=1,Reflex=3</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Would evaluate as true if the character's base
    Fortitude meets or exceeds 1 or their base Reflex meets or exceeds
    3
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PRECHECK:2,Fortitude=2,Will=2,Reflex=2</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Would evaluate as true if any 2 of the 3 three
    listed conditions were met.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PRECLASS
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag is used to check class levels, and
    whether the character meets or exceeds the specified level(s). The
    general format is
    PRECLASS:#,&lt;classparameter&gt;=&lt;level&gt;.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    You can reference the classes in several ways;
    by explicit name, type (TYPE.Base, TYPE.PC, TYPE.Monster,
    TYPE.Prestige, etc), whether the character has spellcasting levels
    in general (SPELLCASTER) or of a specific type (SPELLCASTER.Arcane
    or SPELLCASTER.Divine).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PRECLASS:1,Fighter=3</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have three levels in the Fighter class
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PRECLASS:2,TYPE.Prestige=1,SPELLCASTER=3</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have one Prestige level and three levels in
    a spellcasting class
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=1</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have one level in an arcane casting
    class
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PREEQUIP
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This PRExxx checks for equipment items that you
    have equipped. It will ignore items that are not set as
    "equipped".
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The format for this tag is
    PREEQUIP:#,&lt;itemspecifier&gt;,&lt;itemspecifier&gt;,etc. The
    item may be specified by name or by type (which refers to the TYPE
    tag used in the equipment definition file). If you use the name
    option you may use a wildcard (the % symbol) in it.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    You may also specify the item by it's wield
    category (by using WIELDCATEGORY=... this basically referring to
    weapons). You may use any wield category that is defined in the
    game mode files.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREEQUIP:1,Longsword</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have an item with the exact name "Longsword"
    equipped.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREEQUIP:2,TYPE=Armor,TYPE=Shield</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have both a piece of equipment with "Armor"
    contained in its TYPE tag and one with "Shield" contained in its
    TYPE tag equipped.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREEQUIP:1,WIELDCATEGORY=OneHanded</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have a weapon equipped that has a wield
    category of One Handed.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PREFEAT
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Used to check for the character having the
    specified feats (or not having them when reversed. This tag is used
    very frequently, so it would be advisable to learn this one
    well.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag has a slightly different format in that
    there are not x=y pairs. The basic format is PREFEAT:x,y,z. The x
    is the number of feats (or instances of the same feat in certain
    circumstances) that the character must have. Y is an optional
    parameter called "CHECKMULT" that makes the tag count each instance
    of a feat that can be taken multiple times separately. For example:
    if you do not use the CHECKMULT tag and are checking for the Spell
    Focus feat and the character had it in three different schools, it
    would only count as one feat. Z would be the feat parameters
    themselves.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag also has a special option to allow you
    to specify that the character *doesn't* have a certain feat (while
    still specifying that they do have others). This is done by
    enclosing the feat specification in brackets.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The feat specifications can be done either by
    the feat name or the feat type. For feats that have choices, you
    can specify the general feat only, or a certain specific version of
    it by adding the specific choice in parentheses following the feat
    name (with no space in between).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREFEAT:1,Dodge,Combat Reflexes</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have the Dodge feat or the Combat Reflexes
    feat
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREFEAT:2,TYPE=Fighter</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have two feats with a type of Fighter
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREFEAT:2,CHECKMULT,Spell Focus</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have any two Spell Focus feats
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREFEAT:1,Spell
        Focus(Evocation)</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have Spell Focus in the Evocation
    school
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREFEAT:2,CHECKMULT,Spell Focus,[Spell
        Focus(Evocation)]</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have two Spell Focus feats, and *not* have
    Spell Focus(Evocation)
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PREITEM
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This PRExxx checks for items in a characters
    possession. Note that these items do not have to be equipped or
    carried, they must just appear in the characters inventory.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    It has the general format of
    PREITEM:#,&lt;itemparameter&gt;. The item may be specified by name
    or by type (which refers to the TYPE tag used in the equipment
    definition file). If you use the name option you may use a wildcard
    (the % symbol) in it.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREITEM:1,Longsword</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    <code>Must have an item named
        "Longsword"</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREITEM:1,Longsword %</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have an item that has Longsword as the
    beginning of the name. This would match "Longsword +1" and
    "Longsword (Soulstealer)" but not "Soulstealer Longsword"
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREITEM:2,Longsword,Shortsword</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have a "Longsword" and a "Shortsword"
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREITEM:2,TYPE=Sword,TYPE=Sword</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Must have two different items that have "Sword"
    in the TYPE tag of their .lst definition
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PRELEVEL
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag checks for the total number of class
    levels. Note that it includes monster hit dice and levels.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The format is PRELEVEL:#, where # represents the
    total number of levels the character must meet or exceed to pass
    the PRExxx.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PRELEVEL:4</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Character must have at least four levels between
    all class levels, monstrous hit dice or monstrous class levels.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PRELEVELMAX
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag sets the maximum level. It only counts
    character (non-monster) levels. To meet the PRExxx you must be of
    the specified character level or lower.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    A special note about this token: when used as a
    PRExxx for a feat you will not be allowed to take the feat after
    the specified level, but as long as you take the feat before you
    reach that level you will still receive the benefits of the feat
    even after you are above the level specified (however, it *will*
    show in red on your feat list in the GUI).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PRELEVELMAX:3</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Character may not have more than three character
    (class) levels
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PREMOVE
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag checks that the character meets or
    exceeds the specified types/rates of movement specified. It takes
    the format of
    PREMOVE:#,&lt;movementtype&gt;=&lt;movementrate&gt;,etc.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREMOVE:1,Climb=10,Brachiate=10</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Character must have a Climb movement rate of 10'
    or more or a Brachiate movement rate of 10' or more
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>PREMOVE:2,Walk=30,Fly=30</code>
</p>
<p class="indent3">
    Character must have both a Walk movement rate of
    30' and a Fly movement rate of 30'
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        PREMULT
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag in itself does not check anything. It
    is used to allow the combination of different types of PRExxx tags
    into one. This helps cover those options where you have a PRExxx
    that states "Must have the Dodge feat or Dex of 15" (that "or" in
    there is the kicker that couldn't be handled prior to this tag
    being created).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag may also be nested within itself.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The tag takes the following format:
    PREMULT:#,[&lt;PRExxx&gt;],[&lt;PRExxx&gt;]. The number is the number of
    the other bracketed PRExxx conditions you need to meet.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Examples:
    </strong>
</p>

<p class="indent1">
    This tags can check for a characters race, race
    type (as defined by the TYPE tag), racial type (as defined by the
    RACETYPE tag), or racial subtype (as defined by the RACESUBTYPE
    tag).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Using this PRExxx you can do things such as
    checking for Incorporeal Undead, Giants, etc.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    There are a couple of special additions for this
    tag. First, as in a few other tags you may use the % symbol as a
    wildcard. Second, if you wish to exclude a race, you may put square
    brackets around it.

        PRESIZE
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This tag checks the characters current size. It
    is one of the tags that I wrote about in the introduction that
    requires a suffix (EQ, GTEQ, LT, etc). So what you would actually
    see in the .lst files would be "PRESIZEGTEQ" or "PRESIZELT",
    etc.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The one oddity to this tag is that it does not
    compare to a number but to a letter representing the different
    sizes. Those letters are (and in order from least to greatest):
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        F = Fine
        <br/>
        D = Diminutive

<p class="indent1">
    This tag is used to check the characters
    spellcasting ability.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    You may specify that it be in divine casting
    classes, arcane casting classes, or psionic and you specify how
    many of spells of a certain level are required. You may use
    "Arcane|Divine" in the &lt;spelltype&gt; slot to specify Arcane
    *or* divine.

    any ability that is defined in the statsandchecks.lst file from the
    game mode you are in. The ability/stat is specified in the PRESTAT

        PRETEXT
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This is a unique PRExxx tag in that it doesn't
    check for anything. :)
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    It is used to show a requirement that is
    (usually) not a game mechanic and hence not coded into PCGen so
    that it can be checked. Anything put in this tag will be displayed
    in the PCGen GUI so the user knows what the requirement is, but
    beyond that it will not prevent the user from taking the feat or
    template.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The format it simply PRETEXT:&lt;text&gt;

        PREVAR

<p class="indent1">
    This tag checks the value of program or user
    created variables. It is one of the tags that I wrote about in the
    introduction that requires a suffix (EQ, GTEQ, LT, etc). So what
    you would actually see in the .lst files would be "PREVARGTEQ" or
    "PREVARLT", etc.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This is one of the most commonly used PRExxx
    tags in .lst files. It can be used to check the values of any of
    the computer generated variables (these are usually indicated by
    being entirely capitalized), such as SPELLFAILURE and HP. For a
    list of all the computer generated variables, see the documentation
    for the DEFINE tag. It may also be used to check the value of any
    variable defined by the user via a DEFINE tag in the dataset
    (distinguished by having the first letter of each word capitalized
    with no spaces in between).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    It takes the format of
    PREVAR&lt;suffix&gt;:&lt;varname&gt;,&lt;value&gt;

    To bring us back to our feat topic, I will add
    the required PRExxx for the Improved Critical feat.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    "Prerequisite: Proficient with weapon, base
    attack bonus +8". We dealt with the proficiency requirement in our
    CHOOSE statement (it offers only weapons you are proficient with)
    so we can leave that one out, which leaves the base attack bonus of
    8. If you look up a ways you'll see we need to use the PREATT tag.
    So it would be "PREATT:8".
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    For quick reference, we currently have the
    following for our feat so far (new lines should tab
    characters):
