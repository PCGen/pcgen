   This lesson will discuss what a PCC is, and what it uses to tell
PCGen about itself. This will get a Campaign to show up in PCGen's
source tab, and allow it to load (though it won't load anything
till
   <a href="lfc_lesson02_pcc.html">

   </a>
   ).

  <h2>
   PCC - what it is, and what it does.
  </h2>
  <p>
   A PCGen Campaign Configuration file (PCC) is a text document
which PCGen reads to gather what source files to load, and other
information about itself (the 'campaign') and it's associated
files. Without these types of files, PCGen would not be able to
load the data files.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, I've created my own world with lots of feats, classes,
skills, etc. I want to create a new 'Campaign' in PCGen so I can
easily make up characters and monsters for my world. I'm going to
call it 'My stuff' since it is going to be stuff I'm making for
myself.  :)
  </p>
  <p>
   First I need to create a home for my PCC and the data files
associated with it. I'm going to place it in a subdirectory of
/data/ in the PCGen folder.  This is the standard practice,
although you may certainly create it elsewhere if you wish. I'm
going to make a new folder in /data/ called /mystuff/ just to make
it easy to keep these files separate, and so I'll know where things
are.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next, I'm going to start up my favorite text editor and create
and save an empty file.  I'll call it "mystuff.pcc". 
Notice the .pcc - PCGen looks for that particular extension when
first starting for the list of campaigns it can load.  This
has to be the _final_ extension.  If you accidentally save it
as mystuff.pcc.txt, PCGen will not "see" it and you won't be able
to load your data.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now I'm ready to start telling PCGen what my Campaign is and
which files it needs to load.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     CAMPAIGN:
    </strong></code>
   The name used for the
set of sources in the PCC
  </p>
  <p>
   The first step is to name this campaign for PCGen. (PCGen *does
not* use the PCC file name for that). Since it needs to create a
memory object, and then define parts of it, we HAVE to name the
campaign for PCGen on the FIRST LINE of the file. No other tag
lines can come before it. We tell PCGen the name of the campaign by
using the CAMPAIGN tag. So I put "
   <code>CAMPAIGN:My Stuff</code>
   "
right at the very top. When PCGen lists my campaign, it will
display 'My stuff' in the source tab.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>GAMEMODE:</code>
   </strong>
   what game mode the
campaign is designed for.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next thing I need to do is to tell PCGen what GameMode I
want this campaign to run in. We use the GAMEMODE tag to tell PCGen
which GameMode to run in. Since I want to run it in the normal
gamemode that comes with PCGen, I'm going to use '3e' So I put
"
   <code>GAMEMODE:3e</code>
   " on my second line. Note that this MUST
be the second line in the file.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>RANK:</code>
   </strong>
   Loading order.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moving on, the next step in the process is determining what
priority the data files associated with this PCC have related to
other sources, and what order PCGen should load things in.  To
do this we use the RANK tag. Choosing the rank can get complicated,
because it effects what happens when you use .MOD tags and other
things. But, since this is the "basic PCC" lecture, we'll go the
simple route for the moment. :)
  </p>
  <p>
   I am making this my primary campaign file because I want to load
this one _only_ so I don't have to think about the other sources in
PCGen (and make it easier for my group to load the same stuff). I'm
going to make it
   <code>RANK:1</code>
   . It should now load before any
other source with a higher RANK number.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently, you can only have a RANK between 1 and 9, which
limits how many things can be on different levels. If 2 PCCs are
the same Rank, it loads them in whatever order it has them stored
internally... That's going a bit deep, and we can cover that in
depth in another lesson...
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     TYPE:
    </strong></code>
   Displaying on the Source
tab.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, I need to set up the tree of sources for this PCC that you
see when you first start up PCGen. This is done by using a TYPE
tag. This is a "." delimited list. Each "." creates a sub-level.
The typical method of doing the TYPE tag is to list publisher, and
then type of book, and then anything else necessary. So I'll enter
"TYPE:PCGenLstMonkey.Campaign Setting.My World".
  </p>
  <p>
   My file now looks like this (between the
   <code>-----</code>
   lines is the actual file):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>-----------
     <br/>
     CAMPAIGN:My Stuff
     <br/>
     GAMEMODE:3e
     <br/>
     RANK:1
     <br/>
     TYPE:PCGenLstMonkey.Campaign Setting.My World
     <br/>
     -----------</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   What you'll see on the source screen when you start PCGen up now
if you expanded the tree fully would be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <strong>
     PCGenLstMonkey
     <br/>
     ^---Campaign Setting
     <br/>
     ^---My World
     <br/>
     ^---My Stuff
    </strong>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     SOURCExxx:
    </strong></code>
   Identifying the source
material.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now we come to several tags that are very important if you're
putting in somebody else's material (or perhaps even your own if
you hope to publish some day). The first three give information on
who created/published the material. Those tags are "SOURCELONG"
which is used to give the publishers full name. Next is
"SOURCESHORT" which is used to give an abbreviation to be used for
the publisher and finally is "SOURCEWEB" which is used to put in
the URL of the publishers web site. My entries for these tags will
be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>SOURCELONG:PCGenLstMonkey
     <br/></code>
    <code>SOURCESHORT:PCGLM
     <br/></code>
    <code>SOURCEWEB:http://www.mystuffcampaign.com</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>ISOGL</code>
   </strong>
   and
   <code><strong>
     COPYRIGHT:
    </strong></code>
   OGL Section 15
information.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next up is another important bit at least if you want to share
your files, either with friends or with the rest of the PCGen
community, the ISOGL tag. This is used to indicate whether or not
the source falls under the OGL license (most do... It's really hard
work for it not to).  So we'll enter it this way:
"
   <code>ISOGL:YES</code>
   ". This will trigger the program to insert
the information from the next tag we cover into the OGL (Open
Gaming License) that we display on startup.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next tag is the COPYRIGHT tag. We use this tag to enter our
copyright information, or the publisher's copyright information.
When entering others copyright information, it must be entered
exactly as they have, mis-spellings and all. For my set the tag
will look like this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>COPYRIGHT:PCGenLstMonkey Copyright 2003</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>INFOTEXT:</code>
   </strong>
   further information for
the user.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, I'd like people who look at my data set in PCGen to know
what it's for, so I'll use the INFOTEXT tag to give them a little
information about it. What you enter here will appear in the lower
left pane of the PCGen UI with a heading of "INFO". My tag will
read like this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>INFOTEXT:This data set contains all the information
necessary to create a character for the mystuff campaign
world</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   That is everything you need to tell PCGen about the Campaign
itself.
