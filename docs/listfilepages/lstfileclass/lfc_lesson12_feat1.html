  <p>
   The feat object in PCGen is one of the main workhorses used in
getting the RSRD rules implemented, so it's very important to learn
to create them and what can and cannot be accomplished with them.
While it covers the usual business that is covered by a feat in the
3.5e game, it also does a lot of behind the scenes work in PCGen to
make all the mechanics happen.
  </p>
  <p>
   As an example of what I'm speaking of, a Ranger's Favored Enemy
ability and a Cleric's Turning ability are both coded as "feats" in
PCGen, even though they don't appear as such in the program or on
output.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'll run through the most common tags, explain how to put them
together and then I will go into some specific uses for feats and
how to configure PCGen feats to achieve the desired outcome. In
order to cover all of this, I'm going to split it into different
lessons. This first part of the feat lesson will deal with setting
the feat up for use in general, the second lesson will deal with
implementing the prerequisites (if there are any) to take the feat
and how to implement the effects of the feat as far as the game
mechanics go and a final one to discuss anything that didn't fit in
the first two lessons.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Feat Name
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The feat file is currently a lst file that has one feat entry
per line. The first thing on each line is the feat name. There is
no tag for it, the program assumes that whatever is there is the
name of a feat. Note that you should not use parens in the name of
a feat as those are used by PCGen when referencing a feat with a
sub choice/target.
  </p>
  <p>
   For demonstration purposes we'll code up the "Improved Critical"
feat from the RSRD. So our feat line will start with those
words.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    OUTPUTNAME
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The OUTPUTNAME tag can be used in a couple of different manners.
You can completely change the name of an object (as far as output
is concerned) and not reference the real name at all, or you can
use part of the real name. A special string was developed to grant
access to only the text contained in parens. That string is
"[NAME]" (no quotes).
  </p>
  <p>
   In feats this is mostly done when there are some sort of math
operator characters in the feat name (hyphens being the most often
occurring issue). In newer versions of PCGen this appears to have
been fixed somewhat but in older versions those characters in feat
names caused issues, so we started dropping those characters from
the feat name and then using an OUTPUTNAME tag with those
characters in it to get around the issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, as an example of OUTPUTNAME use, if we wanted the name on
output to be "Critical (Improved)", we could cause it to happen by
entering
   <code>OUTPUTNAME:Critical (Improved)</code>
   . Note that
there is a preference setting that turns off output names so the
user may not see it if they have elected to turn them off.
  </p>
  <p>
   The name "Improved Critical" is just fine as it is, so we'll
skip an OUTPUTNAME tag on this one.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    TYPE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The TYPE tag is used for a couple of different purposes. The
first and most obvious is to set the feat type as indicated by the
source. Another use of it is for internal program use to group a
set of feats together for later selection by an
   <code>ADD:FEAT(TYPE=type)</code>
   tag elsewhere. This is especially
useful when you have several benefits that a PC can choose from.
These TYPEs can also be used in separating feats for display in
different areas on an output sheet.
  </p>
  <p>
   By convention we do not put spaces in the TYPEs (historically it
caused issues in the program). If there is more than one word in
the TYPE, we run them together and capitalize each one. A feat
*can* have more than one TYPE. In that case we put each TYPE in and
separate them with periods.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the RSRD you will see TYPEs of: General, Fighter,
Metamagic, Psionic and ItemCreation. Codemonkey Publishing went so
far as to start creating all class and racial abilities as hidden
feats and they have added SpecialAttack, SpecialQuality,
ClassFeature, Extraordinary, SpellLike and Supernatural as
standards in their datasets. Please note that you are not limited
to just those TYPEs mentioned, you can make a TYPE of anything,
those listed above are just ones you might commonly see.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at the RSRD, Improved Critical is a General feat and a
Fighter feat, so we enter
   <code>TYPE:General.Fighter</code>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    VISIBLE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This is a tag that takes one of four values; YES, NO, DISPLAY
and EXPORT. It controls whether or not the user can see the feat in
the program UI feat list and on the output sheet feat list.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the VISIBLE tag is set to YES (or is not present) then the
user will see the feat in their feat list in the UI and on their
output sheet and they will be able to access it in the UI.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the VISIBLE tag is set to DISPLAY, that means that the user
will be able to access it in the UI, but it will not be listed in
their feat list when they generate an output sheet.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the VISIBLE tag is set to EXPORT then the user will not see
or be able to access the feat in the UI, but it *will* appear in
the feat list when they generate an output sheet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Setting VISIBLE to NO creates what we call a "hidden feat". It's
how we make a lot of things work behind the scenes. The Ranger
Favored Enemy and Cleric Turn Undead are examples of hidden feats
used to implement game mechanics. The only way for this type of
feat to be accessed is by being specifically granted by a .lst file
or being called via an ADD:FEAT chooser tag in a lst file. It will
never appear/be available for selection as a bonus feat from the
UI.
  </p>
  <p>
   A good rule of thumb is that if the feat is listed in the feat
section of a data source, it should be VISIBLE:YES (or leave out
the VISIBLE tag so it defaults to YES). If it's not listed as a
feat in the source, it should be
   <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
   . The
EXPORT and DISPLAY options are used for special cases where we need
to something very strange... :)
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the Improved Critical feat is a normal feat listed in the
RSRD feat section, we'll skip the VISIBLE tag and it will default
to being visible to the user in the UI and on output.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    MULT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The MULT tag is a simple YES or NO tag. It determines whether
you can take a feat more than once. This information is usually
found under the "Special" section in the feat description. It will
tell you whether or not the feat may be taken multiple times.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that if set to YES, then you *must* use a CHOOSE tag in the
feat also.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the RSRD, Improved Critical can be taken more than
once, so we'll use
   <code>MULT:YES</code>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    STACK
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The STACK tag is another tag that is a simple YES or NO. Default
if the tag is not present however is NO in this case. If you have
the MULT tag set to NO, then the STACK tag will have no effect. If
you have the MULT tag set to yes however, this determines whether
or not the feat will stack with itself if you take it more than
once. Like with the MULT tag, this information is usually given to
you in the "Special" section of the feat description.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the RSRD, Improved Critical does not stack with
itself (you can take it again but must choose a different weapon)
so we need to put
   <code>STACK:NO</code>
   in the feat line.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    CHOOSE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   There are many versions of the CHOOSE tag. For full information
please read the section of the PCGen documentation dedicated to
CHOOSE in all it's different forms. In this tutorial I'm just going
to touch on a couple of common ones that you might see/use over and
over again.
  </p>
  <p>
   First is the free text version. That would simply appear as
"CHOOSE:Choice 1|Choice 2|Choice 3" in the .lst file and pop a
chooser with a list containing Choice 1, Choice 2 and Choice 3. You
would use this when the choice is something that is not a game
effect coded for PCGen (a good example of this is the CHOOSE
statement in the 3.0 Ranger Favored Enemy hidden feat).
  </p>
  <p>
   Next comes CHOOSE:NOCHOICE. This causes the CHOOSER to not be
displayed. This is useful when you have a feat that may be taken
multiple times that doesn't really have any choice to it. Since you
used MULT:YES you must have a CHOOSE, but there really is no
choice. A good example of this is the Toughness feat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another popular one is CHOOSE:FEAT=featname. This is used mostly
in cascading feats where the new feat will apply to the object of a
previous feat. A good example of the use of this is the Weapon
Specialization feat. It uses "CHOOSE:FEAT=Weapon Focus|1" which
presents a list of all the weapons that the character has taken the
Weapon Focus feat for and lets the user pick one.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moving on to our current feat under construction, we see that
Improved Critical requires that you be proficient with the weapon
you choose this feat for. While this is listed as a prerequisite,
it actually affects what you can choose from so we implement it via
a CHOOSE restriction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking through the PCGen documentation for a CHOOSE tag that
will suit our purposes, we find the following:
CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFS|LIST which is supposed to present a chooser
containing a list of all the weapon proficiencies that your
character has. We'll add "CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFS|LIST|1" to the feat
line.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    DESC
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This tag is used to hold the one to two line "flavor text" that
describes the feat. This is usually the first couple of sentences
found under the feat name.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is what will be output to the feat description field if the
"Display Feat Description" checkbox is checked in the preferences.
Otherwise the more verbose contents of the BENEFIT tag will be
displayed.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Improved Critical feat we can paraphrase the short
description and enter "DESC:With your selected weapon you know how
to hit where it hurts."
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    DESCISPI
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Another simple YES or NO tag. If the tag is not present it
defaults to NO.
  </p>
  <p>
   This tag is used to indicate to the program that the description
is considered to be Product Identity of the publisher and should be
marked as such when displayed in the program. Permission must be
obtained from the publisher to use Product Identity.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no Product Identity in the Improved Critical
description, so we will leave this tag out of our feat.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    BENEFIT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This tag is meant to contain the text from the "Benefit" section
of the feat from the source material. This text will be displayed
in the feat description field in both the UI and on output if the
"Display Feat Description" checkbox in the Appearance/Display
Options Preference window is unchecked. Otherwise the (much
shorter) text from the DESC tag will be displayed.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Improved Critical feat we would enter
   <code>BENEFIT:When
using the weapon you selected, your threat range is
doubled.</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that it is quite common to leave this tag out so as to
encourage people to purchase the books that the dataset
represents.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    COST
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This tag is used to set the cost (in feat slots) of the feat. If
it is not present it defaults to a value of 1. This tag can be used
to set up a system where you can take a penalty type feat to get
another positive effect feat (think Flaws &amp; Traits).
  </p>
  <p>
   Since Improved Critical is a normal feat, we will leave the COST
tag out and let it default to a cost of one feat slot.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    SOURCELONG
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This is a free-form text tag. We put the full name of the source
here. This tag may be entered once at the top of the .lst file and
will apply to everything below it until another SOURCELONG tag is
encountered, or it may be placed on each feat line (which is the
practice CMP has adopted for this tag).
  </p>
  <p>
   Since we are using the RSRD for our example, the tag would be
   <code>SOURCELONG:Revised (v.3.5) System Reference
Document</code>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    SOURCESHORT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This tag is also a free-form text tag. We put an abbreviated
version of the source name here for use in the program to help keep
everything on the screen. This tag may be entered once at the top
of the .lst file and will apply to everything below it until
another SOURCESHORT tag is encountered, or it may be placed on each
feat line (which is the practice CMP has adopted for this tag).
  </p>
  <p>
   Again, since we are using the RSRD for our example reference,
the tag would be
   <strong>
    SOURCESHORT:RSRD
   </strong>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    SOURCEWEB
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This tag is for the entry of the URL pointing to the
product/book. This tag may be entered once at the top of the .lst
file and will apply to everything below it until another SOURCEWEB
tag is encountered, or it may be placed on each feat line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the case of the RSRD, the tag would be
   <code>SOURCEWEB:http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35</code>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    SOURCEPAGE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This is just what it seems, where we indicate the page from the
source material where you can find the text for the feat. It takes
freeform text, so anything you put in there will be displayed when
using the SOURCEPAGE output token.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you are going from an OGL book the format is usually
   <code>SOURCEPAGE:p.#</code>
   . If you are working from an online
document such as the SRD, it would be the filename, so
   <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;filename&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Since we are working from the RSRD, our tag will look like
   <code>SOURCEPAGE:Feats.rtf</code>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   I'm going to end this lesson here even though our example feat
isn't complete yet. We've covered the most commonly occurring tags
in feats here (other than PRE and BONUS tags). In the next lesson I
will cover setting up prerequisites to take the feats and
implementing the effects of feats (which will allow us to complete
the entry of the Improved Critical feat).
  </p>
  <p>
   For quick reference, we currently have the following for our
feat so far (new lines should tab characters):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>Improved Critical
     <br/>
     TYPE:General.Fighter
     <br/>
     MULT:YES
     <br/>
     STACK:NO
     <br/>
     CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFS|LIST|1
     <br/>
     DESC:With your selected weapon you know how to hit where it
hurts.
     <br/>
     BENEFIT:When using the weapon you selected, your threat range is
doubled.
     <br/>
