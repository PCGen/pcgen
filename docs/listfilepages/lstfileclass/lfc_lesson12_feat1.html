<p>
    The feat object in PCGen is one of the main workhorses used in
    getting the RSRD rules implemented, so it's very important to learn
    to create them and what can and cannot be accomplished with them.
    While it covers the usual business that is covered by a feat in the
    3.5e game, it also does a lot of behind the scenes work in PCGen to
    make all the mechanics happen.
</p>
<p>
    As an example of what I'm speaking of, a Ranger's Favored Enemy
    ability and a Cleric's Turning ability are both coded as "feats" in
    PCGen, even though they don't appear as such in the program or on
    output.
</p>
<p>
    I'll run through the most common tags, explain how to put them
    together and then I will go into some specific uses for feats and
    how to configure PCGen feats to achieve the desired outcome. In
    order to cover all of this, I'm going to split it into different
    lessons. This first part of the feat lesson will deal with setting
    the feat up for use in general, the second lesson will deal with
    implementing the prerequisites (if there are any) to take the feat
    and how to implement the effects of the feat as far as the game
    mechanics go and a final one to discuss anything that didn't fit in
    the first two lessons.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        Feat Name
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The feat file is currently a lst file that has one feat entry
    per line. The first thing on each line is the feat name. There is
    no tag for it, the program assumes that whatever is there is the
    name of a feat. Note that you should not use parens in the name of
    a feat as those are used by PCGen when referencing a feat with a
    sub choice/target.
</p>
<p>
    For demonstration purposes we'll code up the "Improved Critical"
    feat from the RSRD. So our feat line will start with those
    words.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        OUTPUTNAME
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The OUTPUTNAME tag can be used in a couple of different manners.
    You can completely change the name of an object (as far as output
    is concerned) and not reference the real name at all, or you can
    use part of the real name. A special string was developed to grant
    access to only the text contained in parens. That string is
    "[NAME]" (no quotes).
</p>
<p>
    In feats this is mostly done when there are some sort of math
    operator characters in the feat name (hyphens being the most often
    occurring issue). In newer versions of PCGen this appears to have
    been fixed somewhat but in older versions those characters in feat
    names caused issues, so we started dropping those characters from
    the feat name and then using an OUTPUTNAME tag with those
    characters in it to get around the issues.
</p>
<p>
    So, as an example of OUTPUTNAME use, if we wanted the name on
    output to be "Critical (Improved)", we could cause it to happen by
    entering
    <code>OUTPUTNAME:Critical (Improved)</code>
    . Note that
    there is a preference setting that turns off output names so the
    user may not see it if they have elected to turn them off.
</p>
<p>
    The name "Improved Critical" is just fine as it is, so we'll
    skip an OUTPUTNAME tag on this one.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        TYPE
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The TYPE tag is used for a couple of different purposes. The
    first and most obvious is to set the feat type as indicated by the
    source. Another use of it is for internal program use to group a
    set of feats together for later selection by an
    <code>ADD:FEAT(TYPE=type)</code>
    tag elsewhere. This is especially
    useful when you have several benefits that a PC can choose from.
    These TYPEs can also be used in separating feats for display in
    different areas on an output sheet.
</p>
<p>
    By convention we do not put spaces in the TYPEs (historically it
    caused issues in the program). If there is more than one word in
    the TYPE, we run them together and capitalize each one. A feat
    *can* have more than one TYPE. In that case we put each TYPE in and
    separate them with periods.
</p>
<p>
    From the RSRD you will see TYPEs of: General, Fighter,
    Metamagic, Psionic and ItemCreation. Codemonkey Publishing went so
    far as to start creating all class and racial abilities as hidden
    feats and they have added SpecialAttack, SpecialQuality,
    ClassFeature, Extraordinary, SpellLike and Supernatural as
    standards in their datasets. Please note that you are not limited
    to just those TYPEs mentioned, you can make a TYPE of anything,
    those listed above are just ones you might commonly see.
</p>
<p>
    Looking at the RSRD, Improved Critical is a General feat and a
    Fighter feat, so we enter
    <code>TYPE:General.Fighter</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        VISIBLE
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is a tag that takes one of four values; YES, NO, DISPLAY
    and EXPORT. It controls whether or not the user can see the feat in
    the program UI feat list and on the output sheet feat list.
</p>
<p>
    If the VISIBLE tag is set to YES (or is not present) then the
    user will see the feat in their feat list in the UI and on their
    output sheet and they will be able to access it in the UI.
</p>
<p>
    If the VISIBLE tag is set to DISPLAY, that means that the user
    will be able to access it in the UI, but it will not be listed in
    their feat list when they generate an output sheet.
</p>
<p>
    If the VISIBLE tag is set to EXPORT then the user will not see
    or be able to access the feat in the UI, but it *will* appear in
    the feat list when they generate an output sheet.
</p>
<p>
    Setting VISIBLE to NO creates what we call a "hidden feat". It's
    how we make a lot of things work behind the scenes. The Ranger
    Favored Enemy and Cleric Turn Undead are examples of hidden feats
    used to implement game mechanics. The only way for this type of
    feat to be accessed is by being specifically granted by a .lst file
    or being called via an ADD:FEAT chooser tag in a lst file. It will
    never appear/be available for selection as a bonus feat from the
    UI.
</p>
<p>
    A good rule of thumb is that if the feat is listed in the feat
    section of a data source, it should be VISIBLE:YES (or leave out
    the VISIBLE tag so it defaults to YES). If it's not listed as a
    feat in the source, it should be
    <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
    . The
    EXPORT and DISPLAY options are used for special cases where we need
    to something very strange... :)
</p>
<p>
    Since the Improved Critical feat is a normal feat listed in the
    RSRD feat section, we'll skip the VISIBLE tag and it will default
    to being visible to the user in the UI and on output.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        MULT
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The MULT tag is a simple YES or NO tag. It determines whether
    you can take a feat more than once. This information is usually
    found under the "Special" section in the feat description. It will
    tell you whether or not the feat may be taken multiple times.
</p>
<p>
    Note that if set to YES, then you *must* use a CHOOSE tag in the
    feat also.
</p>
<p>
    According to the RSRD, Improved Critical can be taken more than
    once, so we'll use
    <code>MULT:YES</code>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        STACK
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The STACK tag is another tag that is a simple YES or NO. Default
    if the tag is not present however is NO in this case. If you have
    the MULT tag set to NO, then the STACK tag will have no effect. If
    you have the MULT tag set to yes however, this determines whether
    or not the feat will stack with itself if you take it more than
    once. Like with the MULT tag, this information is usually given to
    you in the "Special" section of the feat description.
</p>
<p>
    According to the RSRD, Improved Critical does not stack with
    itself (you can take it again but must choose a different weapon)
    so we need to put
    <code>STACK:NO</code>
    in the feat line.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        CHOOSE
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are many versions of the CHOOSE tag. For full information
    please read the section of the PCGen documentation dedicated to
    CHOOSE in all it's different forms. In this tutorial I'm just going
    to touch on a couple of common ones that you might see/use over and
    over again.
</p>
<p>
    First is the free text version. That would simply appear as
    "CHOOSE:Choice 1|Choice 2|Choice 3" in the .lst file and pop a
    chooser with a list containing Choice 1, Choice 2 and Choice 3. You
    would use this when the choice is something that is not a game
    effect coded for PCGen (a good example of this is the CHOOSE
    statement in the 3.0 Ranger Favored Enemy hidden feat).
</p>
<p>
    Next comes CHOOSE:NOCHOICE. This causes the CHOOSER to not be
    displayed. This is useful when you have a feat that may be taken
    multiple times that doesn't really have any choice to it. Since you
    used MULT:YES you must have a CHOOSE, but there really is no
    choice. A good example of this is the Toughness feat.
</p>
<p>
    Another popular one is CHOOSE:FEAT=featname. This is used mostly
    in cascading feats where the new feat will apply to the object of a
    previous feat. A good example of the use of this is the Weapon
    Specialization feat. It uses "CHOOSE:FEAT=Weapon Focus|1" which
    presents a list of all the weapons that the character has taken the
    Weapon Focus feat for and lets the user pick one.
</p>
<p>
    Moving on to our current feat under construction, we see that
    Improved Critical requires that you be proficient with the weapon
    you choose this feat for. While this is listed as a prerequisite,
    it actually affects what you can choose from so we implement it via
    a CHOOSE restriction.
</p>
<p>
    Looking through the PCGen documentation for a CHOOSE tag that
    will suit our purposes, we find the following:
    CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFS|LIST which is supposed to present a chooser
    containing a list of all the weapon proficiencies that your
    character has. We'll add "CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFS|LIST|1" to the feat
    line.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        DESC
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag is used to hold the one to two line "flavor text" that
    describes the feat. This is usually the first couple of sentences
    found under the feat name.
</p>
<p>
    This is what will be output to the feat description field if the
    "Display Feat Description" checkbox is checked in the preferences.
    Otherwise the more verbose contents of the BENEFIT tag will be
    displayed.
</p>
<p>
    For the Improved Critical feat we can paraphrase the short
    description and enter "DESC:With your selected weapon you know how
    to hit where it hurts."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        DESCISPI
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Another simple YES or NO tag. If the tag is not present it
    defaults to NO.
</p>
<p>
    This tag is used to indicate to the program that the description
    is considered to be Product Identity of the publisher and should be
    marked as such when displayed in the program. Permission must be
    obtained from the publisher to use Product Identity.
</p>
<p>
    There is no Product Identity in the Improved Critical
    description, so we will leave this tag out of our feat.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        BENEFIT
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag is meant to contain the text from the "Benefit" section
    of the feat from the source material. This text will be displayed
    in the feat description field in both the UI and on output if the
    "Display Feat Description" checkbox in the Appearance/Display
    Options Preference window is unchecked. Otherwise the (much
    shorter) text from the DESC tag will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
    For the Improved Critical feat we would enter
    <code>BENEFIT:When
        using the weapon you selected, your threat range is
        doubled.</code>
</p>
<p>
    Note that it is quite common to leave this tag out so as to
    encourage people to purchase the books that the dataset
    represents.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        COST
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag is used to set the cost (in feat slots) of the feat. If
    it is not present it defaults to a value of 1. This tag can be used
    to set up a system where you can take a penalty type feat to get
    another positive effect feat (think Flaws &amp; Traits).
</p>
<p>
    Since Improved Critical is a normal feat, we will leave the COST
    tag out and let it default to a cost of one feat slot.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        SOURCELONG
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is a free-form text tag. We put the full name of the source
    here. This tag may be entered once at the top of the .lst file and
    will apply to everything below it until another SOURCELONG tag is
    encountered, or it may be placed on each feat line (which is the
    practice CMP has adopted for this tag).
</p>
<p>
    Since we are using the RSRD for our example, the tag would be
    <code>SOURCELONG:Revised (v.3.5) System Reference
        Document</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        SOURCESHORT
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag is also a free-form text tag. We put an abbreviated
    version of the source name here for use in the program to help keep
    everything on the screen. This tag may be entered once at the top
    of the .lst file and will apply to everything below it until
    another SOURCESHORT tag is encountered, or it may be placed on each
    feat line (which is the practice CMP has adopted for this tag).
</p>
<p>
    Again, since we are using the RSRD for our example reference,
    the tag would be
    <strong>
        SOURCESHORT:RSRD
    </strong>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        SOURCEWEB
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag is for the entry of the URL pointing to the
    product/book. This tag may be entered once at the top of the .lst
    file and will apply to everything below it until another SOURCEWEB
    tag is encountered, or it may be placed on each feat line.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of the RSRD, the tag would be
    <code>SOURCEWEB:http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        SOURCEPAGE
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is just what it seems, where we indicate the page from the
    source material where you can find the text for the feat. It takes
    freeform text, so anything you put in there will be displayed when
    using the SOURCEPAGE output token.
</p>
<p>
    When you are going from an OGL book the format is usually
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:p.#</code>
    . If you are working from an online
    document such as the SRD, it would be the filename, so
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;filename&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
    Since we are working from the RSRD, our tag will look like
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:Feats.rtf</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    I'm going to end this lesson here even though our example feat
    isn't complete yet. We've covered the most commonly occurring tags
    in feats here (other than PRE and BONUS tags). In the next lesson I
    will cover setting up prerequisites to take the feats and
    implementing the effects of feats (which will allow us to complete
    the entry of the Improved Critical feat).
</p>
<p>
    For quick reference, we currently have the following for our
    feat so far (new lines should tab characters):
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>Improved Critical
            <br/>

            MULT:YES
            <br/>
            STACK:NO
            <br/>
            CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFS|LIST|1
            <br/>
            DESC:With your selected weapon you know how to hit where it
            hurts.
            <br/>

            doubled.
