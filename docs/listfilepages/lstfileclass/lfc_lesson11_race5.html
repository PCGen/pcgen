One of those things is a prereqfor anyone to be able to take that kit.&nbsp; All global prereqs are allowable on this line.</p><p>For default monsters we want to make sure that only a character with a matching race or no raceselected can take the kit.&nbsp; We don't want those pesky Ninja Monkeys selecting our Default Celestial (Solar) kit.</p><p>To do this we will add a <code>PRERACE</code> tag to the <code>STARTPACK</code> line we started above.  So we enter a few tabs and type:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>PRERACE:Celestial (Solar)</code></p></blockquote><p>However, we also want to allow new characters without a race to select this Kit.  To do this we needto add a new tag to the prereq.&nbsp; To have multiple prereqs we need to use the <code>PREMULT</code>.&nbsp;To specify that only a character without a race can select the Kit we use the syntax &quot;<code>!PRERACE:%</code>&quot;.&nbsp; So the final tag for the Solar would be:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:Celestial (Solar)],[!PRERACE:%]</code></p></blockquote><p>The tag will be very similar for the Ninja Monkey.</p><blockquote>  <p><code>PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:Ninja Monkey],[!PRERACE:%]</code></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><code>EQUIPBUY</code></strong></p><p>This tag is used to set the percentage of list price that creatures applying this kit must pay for equipment added through the kit.&nbsp; Monsters are generally granted the equipment listed in the race write up for free so we generally wantto set this to &quot;0&quot; meaning the equipment is granted for free.</p><p>The code to do this would be (also on the <code>STARTPACK</code> line):</p><blockquote>  <p><code>PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:Ninja Monkey],[!PRERACE:%]</code></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><code>VISIBLE</code></strong></p><p>This tag allows us to control the visibility of the Kit in the user interface.&nbsp;This tag is also specified on the <code>STARTPACK</code> line. We want anyone who is qualified (met the prerequisites we specified earlier) to take the kit to see it so we will enter &quot;QUALIFY&quot; as the visibility.  We could also specify &quot;YES&quot;or &quot;NO&quot; to control the visibility of the kit.</p><blockquote>  <p><code>VISIBLE:QUALIFY</code></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><code>RACE</code></strong></p><p>The next tag we will cover is the <code>RACE</code> tag.&nbsp; As you may haveguessed this allows us to set the race of the character applying the kit.&nbsp; Now because setting a character's race to a race it already is can cause problems in PCGenwe want to only set the race if the character doesn't' already have one (all other scenarioswere excluded by the prereqs we entered earlier for the Kit).</p><p>This brings up an important point to note, any kit line can be qualified with a <code>PREXXX</code>tag.&nbsp; In our case we will use part of the prereq we entered for race above.</p><blockquote>  <p><code>RACE:Celestial (Solar)&lt;tab&gt;!PRERACE:%</code></p></blockquote><p>This tells the program execute this line to set the character's race to Celestial (Solar) onlyif the character doesn't already have a race selected.&nbsp; For the Ninja Monkey just replace Celestial (Solar) with Ninja Monkey in the above line.</p><hr><p><strong><code>NAME</code></strong></p><p>Generally, we set the name of the monster character to the name of the monster exactly as it appears in the source.&nbsp; We use the <code>NAME</code> to accomplish that.</p><blockquote>  <p><code>NAME:Solar</code></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><code>GENDER</code></strong></p><p>Sometimes a particular monster always has a certain gender, or no gender at all.&nbsp;Neither the Solar nor the Ninja Monkey specify a particular gender so we will skip this tag for them</p><p>Just to illustrate if you wanted to create a special female version of the Solar you could specify &quot;GENDER:Female&quot; on either the <code>NAME</code> line or itsown line.</p><hr><p><strong><code>ALIGN</code></strong></p><p>Next up is alignment.&nbsp; Obviously if the creatures specifies that it is &quot;Always&quot;a particular alignment you can simply specify that in the Kit and any characters createdusing the kit will have the appropriate alignment.</p><p>The Solar specified that they are &quot;Always Good (Any)&quot;.&nbsp; We can code that in a Kit as follows:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>ALIGN:LG|NG|CG</code></p></blockquote><p>This will present a chooser to the user when the kit is applied allowing them to selectone of the three specified alignments.</p><p>If you remember back to our earlier lesson, we did not all a PREALIGN for the NinjaMonkey because they were listed as &quot;Usually Chaotic Good&quot;.&nbsp; Since weare creating a kit for the &quot;usual&quot; case (default) we will specify Chaotic Goodas the alignment for our Default Ninja Monkey.</p><blockquote>  <p><code>ALIGN:CG</code></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><code>STAT</code></strong></p><p>With this tag we can set a character's base stats.&nbsp; For default monsters thelogic is the base stat is 10 unless the value listed in the write up is odd in which casethe base stat is 11.&nbsp; Occasionally, a creature write up will specify that the monsteruses a different set of stats, usually the non-elite array.</p><p>It is a good idea to explicitly set each stat a default monster possesses (is not a nonability) because otherwise a users preference will be used.</p><p>Returning to our examples the <code>STAT</code> line for the Solar would look like:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>STAT:STR=10|DEX=10|CON=10|INT=11|WIS=11|CHA=11</code></p></blockquote><p>Our Ninja Monkey has stats of Str 17, Dex 18, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 15, Cha 10 so ourstat line looks like:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>STAT:STR=11|DEX=10|CON=10|INT=11|WIS=11|CHA=10</code></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><code>SKILL/RANK</code></strong></p><p>This set of tags, which must appear on the same line, allows you to buy skill ranksin a skill for the character applying the kit.&nbsp; All of the comments under the sectionfor <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK</code> apply here as well, except that the workaround for skillswhich require a choice is not required.&nbsp; To handle a choice of skills in a defaultkit we enter all the choices separated by a pipe character &quot;|&quot;.&nbsp; We then usethe special tag <code>COUNT</code> to specify how many choice from the list the character should get.&nbsp; You can specify specific skills or types of skills like <code>TYPE.Knowledge</code>.</p><p>The skills are granted exactly as if you had picked them from the user interface.&nbsp; Thecharacter must have sufficient skill points to buy the listed skills.&nbsp; Occasionally a source will grant more ranks than the monster can actually pay for.&nbsp; In these cases youhave two options.&nbsp; You can either not grant the ranks and note that the source appearsto be in error or you can use the <code>FREE:YES</code> tag on the <code>SKILL</code> line togrant the extra ranks for &quot;free&quot; (no skill points will be spent).</p><p>The kit will also enforce the user preference for Max Ranks for a skill.&nbsp; Sometimes inorder to get the listed total bonus to a skill it would be necessary to grant more ranks thanthe max ranks for a skill.&nbsp; Usually this happens with cross-class skills.&nbsp; To allow the skill to go above the maximum you can set the &quot;Bypass Max Skill Rank&quot; setting inthe PCGen preferences.</p><p>With all that being said our we would add the following lines to our Solar kit (each SKILL/RANK pair should be on a new line, replace <code> TAB </code> with a real tab character):<blockquote>  <p><code>  SKILL:Concentration TAB RANK:11<br/>  SKILL:Escape Artist TAB RANK:25<br/>  SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:25<br/>  SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:25<br/>  SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:25<br/>  SKILL:Sense Motive TAB RANK:25<br/>  SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:25<br/>  SKILL:Search TAB RANK:25<br/>  SKILL:Spellcraft TAB RANK:13<br/>  SKILL:TYPE.Knowledge|TYPE.Craft TAB COUNT:5 TAB RANK:25<br/>  </code></p></blockquote><p>Our Ninja Monkey will be very similar:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>  SKILL:Balance TAB RANK:5<br/>  SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:5<br/>  SKILL:Jump TAB RANK:5<br/>  SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:5<br/>  SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:5<br/>  SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:5<br/>  </code></p></blockquote><p class="sidebar"><strong>Update to RSRD</strong><br/>The skill ranks for the RSRD versions of the monsters are as follows:<br/>	<code>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Diplomacy TAB RANK:23<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Concentration TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Escape Artist TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Search TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Sense Motive TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Spellcraft TAB RANK:21<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:25<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:TYPE=Knowledge|TYPE=Craft TAB RANK:25 TAB COUNT:5<br/>	</code>	<br/>Our Ninja Monkey will be very similar:<br/>	<code>  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Hide TAB RANK:4<br/>  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Listen TAB RANK:3<br/>  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Move Silently TAB RANK:4<br/>  &nbsp; &nbsp; SKILL:Spot TAB RANK:3<br/>	</code></p><hr><p><strong><code>FEAT</code></strong></p><p>The <code>FEAT</code> tag is a very simple one.&nbsp; It simply lists eachfeat a creature gets one to a line.&nbsp; The <code>FREE:YES</code> tag can be added to the line to grant the feat without charging the feat pool.&nbsp; This wouldprimarily useful if a creature has more feats than it should for its HD.</p><p>Our Solar is fairly straightforward.&nbsp; The code appears below.</p><blockquote><p>	<code>	FEAT:Cleave<br/>	FEAT:Dodge<br/>	FEAT:Great Cleave<br/>	FEAT:Improved Initiative<br/>	FEAT:Mobility<br/>	FEAT:Power Attack<br/>	</code></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong><code>GEAR</code></strong></p><p>The last set of tags we need to cover to complete our Solar and Ninja Monkeyexamples are the <code>GEAR</code> tags.&nbsp; The Solar gets two pieces of equipment by default, a +5 dancing vorpal greatsword and a +2 mighty (+5 Str) composite longbow.&nbsp; To enter this into the kit we first grant the base item with the <code>GEAR</code> tag like so &quot;<code>GEAR:Greatsword</code>&quot;.</p><p>Then we need to add the special abilities to the base item.&nbsp; We do this by addingEQMODs just like using the equipment customizer.&nbsp; For the greatsword we need toadd the following EQMODs, MWORKW, PLUS5W, DANCE, and VORPAL.&nbsp So we will add thefollowing code to the <code>GEAR</code> line we created earlier: <code>EQMOD:MWORKW.PLUS5W.DANCE.VORPAL</code>.</p><p>Now we need to make sure that the item is the correct size for the creature we arecreating.&nbsp; By default, PCGen creates all items at Medium size.&nbsp; Our Solar howeveris a Large size creature so we want his greatsword to be Large as well.&nbsp; We can dothis with the <code>SIZE</code> tag.&nbsp; The <code>SIZE</code> tag takes the singlecharacter abbreviation for size or a special tag <code>PC</code> to size the itemto whatever size the character is.&nbsp; We will add the <code>SIZE:PC</code> tag to our<code>GEAR</code> line to make sure that the Solar's greatsword grows if it does (by adding HD).</p><p>The last thing we need to do is equip the item.&nbsp; If we do not equip the itemthe gear will be added to the character as a possession but will not be used.&nbsp; Thiscould be useful for items left in the monster's lair but in our case we actually want theSolar to use its greatsword.&nbsp; To do this we use the <code>LOCATION</code> tag.&nbsp; This tag uses the same locations as you would see in the user interface when equipping an item.&nbsp;A greatsword is a two-handed weapon so it can only be equipped to one place &quot;Both Hands&quot;.&nbsp;We add the tag <code>LOCATION:Both Hands</code>.&nbsp For items that are not weapons thatcan only be equipped to one place on the body (like a ring) you can simply specify &quot;Equipped&quot; in the <code>LOCATION</code> tag and PCGen will equip it to the correct location.</p><p>Now if we put it all together, our kit lines for the Solar's equipment will looklike this:</p><blockquote><p>	<code>	GEAR:Greatsword TAB EQMOD:MWORKW.PLUS5W.DANCE.VORPAL TAB SIZE:PC TAB LOCATION:Both Hands<br/>	GEAR:Longbow (Composite) TAB EQMOD:MWORKW.BOWSTR|5.PLUS2W TAB SIZE:PC TAB LOCATION:Carried	</code></p></blockquote><hr><p>Well, this brings to a close the lessons on creating monster kits for use   in PCGen.&nbsp; There is much more you can do with kits.&nbsp; I encourage you to check  out the documentation for more in depth information on everything kits can do.</p><p>Aaron<br>  Docs 2nd</p>  <p>   <!-- <p class="cvsfooter">$Source: /cvsroot/pcgendocs/pcgendocs/docs/listfilepages/lstfileclass/lfc_lesson11_race5.html,v $ ($Revision: 1.1 $) last updated $Date: 2006/02/24 02:13:06 $ by $Author: boomer70 $</p> --></p></body></html>
