    This will be the final lesson on creating "monster" race files.
    Once you've read through this and understand it (and the preceding
    lessons) you should not have too much difficulty in creating a
    monster race file for PCGen.
</p>
<p>
    With that said, there's a lot of material to be covered, so lets
    dive right in.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>MONCSKILL</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    To define the skills that are considered class skill for each
    race we use the
    <code>MONCSKILL</code>
    tag.  Following the tag
    is a list of the race's class skills, separated by the pipe ("|")
    character.
</p>
<p>
    To determine a race's class skills, we once again turn to the
    "Skills" section of the race's listing (when entering an existing
    source and not making up a new race).  Every skill listed
    there is a class skill for that race.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar's entry would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>MONCSKILL:Concentration|Escape
            Artist|Hide|TYPE.Knowledge|TYPE.Craft|Listen|Move
            Silently|Search|Sense Motive|Spellcraft|Spot</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that we have granted ALL Knowledge and Craft skills as
    racial skills since they may choose from among all of them.
</p>
<p>
    The entry for the Ninja Monkey will be much shorter.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>MONCSKILL:Balance|Hide|Jump|Listen|Move
            Silently|Spot</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The class skills for the Solar in the RSRD are a little different
    than in the SRD. The tag in 3.5 would look like:
    <br/>
    MONCSKILL:Concentration|TYPE.Craft|TYPE.Knowledge|Diplomacy|Escape
    Artist|Hide|Listen|Move Silently|Search|Sense
    Motive|Spellcraft|Spot.
    <br/>
    Note the neither Survival nor Use Rope are class skills since they
    are only listed for skill synergy purposes.
    <br/>
    The Ninja Monkey is unchanged. It should be noted that Balance
    <strong>
        is
    </strong>
    a class skill even though they have no ranks in
    it since they have a racial bonus to Balance.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    The PCGen data team is moving away from
    using the "Default Monster" setting.  Default Monster Kits are
    being used instead.
</p>
<p>
    Now comes another section where we have to work backwards to
    arrive at the numbers we need to use.  This would be to
    determine what ranks the race gets in each skill.
</p>
<p>
    To begin, we look in the race listing at the "Skills"
    section.  The numbers given here are the final numbers 
    once everything (racial bonuses, armor/encumbrance, stat modifiers,
    feats, etc) is taken into account.  They assume that all
    equipment listed for the monster is present and equipped and
    affecting those physical skills where they should.
</p>
<p>
    For the Solar, the first skill listed is Concentration. 
    The final value should be +16.  We'll begin by subtracting the
    appropriate stat modifier (5 from constitution), so we're down to
    +11.  Looking further, we see no racial skill modifiers for
    this skill, no feats that affect it and since it's not a physical
    feat equipment would have no effect.  Our tag for this skill
    would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK|Concentration|11|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Next up is the Escape Artist skill.  The final value needs
    to be +30. Subtracting the stat modifier for the skill (5 from
    dexterity) puts us at +25.  Once again there are no racial
    bonuses or feats affecting this skill. It is physical so we need to
    check that there are no armor or encumbrance to affect it. 
    The two  pieces of equipment for a solar are it's greatsword
    and it's longbow.  These are not enough to encumber it, so
    there is no effect on the physical skills.  Leaving us with a
    skillrank of 25.
</p>
<p>
    Several of the other skills work out to have this value after
    doing all the math, and the BONUS:SKILLRANK tag  will let us
    apply the same bonus to multiple skills by simply listing them in a
    comma separated list.  Our final tag for this skill (and
    several others) would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK|Escape Artist,Hide,Listen,Move
            Silently,Sense Motive,Spot|25|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that a Solar gets a choice of any five craft skills OR any
    five knowledge skills.  To let the PCGen user  make these
    choices, we need to get a little bit creative.  :)  I've
    created a set of feats that will present a chooser for knowledge or
    craft skills, and after choosing one it will present a chooser
    listing all of the  skills of the selected type and allow them
    to pick five of them and then assign the appropriate number
    of  ranks to those skills.  I use an
    "
    <code>ADD:FEAT(TYPE=FiveKnowledge22,TYPE=FiveCraft22)</code>
    " tag
    in this race file to  start the feat chooser.
</p>
<p>
    I will wait to cover the creation of these feats until we go
    over feat files, but I wanted to make sure and  mention their
    use here as the situation of a race getting a choice of certain
    skills comes up with some regularity and you need to know how to
    deal with it.
</p>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey its somewhat simpler.  We just need to
    determine how many skill points he should have for  his race
    type and HD and then choose what skills he gets ranks in. 
    According to the MM (pg. 11) A Monstrous Humanoid should have 2 x
    Intelligence score +2/EHD.  So the Ninja Monkey gets 30
    skillpoints to spend.
</p>
<p>
    I think I'll give him ranks in Balance, Hide, Jump, Listen, Move
    Silently and Spot.  TO keep it simple I'll  just divide
    the skillranks equally among these skills.  Our tag would
    be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:SKILLRANK|Balance,Hide,Jump,Listen,Move
            Silently,Spot|5|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The calculations for coming up with skill ranks is the same as in
    3.0 so I will just present the revised tags. Note that you also
    need to account for synergy bonuses when calculating ranks.
    <br/>
    BONUS:SKILLRANK|Concentration,Escape
    Artist,Hide,Listen,Move Silently,Search,Sense
    Motive,Spot|25|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
    <br/>
    BONUS:SKILLRANK|Diplomacy|23|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
    <br/>
    BONUS:SKILLRANK|Spellcraft|21|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
    <br/>
    For the Ninja Monkey the skill ranks would be divided as
    follows:
    <br/>
    BONUS:SKILLRANK|Hide,Move
    Silently|4|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
    <br/>
    BONUS:SKILLRANK|Listen,Spot|3|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y
    <br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BONUS:SKILL</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Several races get racial modifiers to certain skills.  Some
    of them are listed in the race write up (often these are skills
    such as Search, Spot and Listen), and some (movement related ones)
    are not.  (Gotta love WotC). Creatures that have a natural
    Climb movement rate get a +8 to the Climb skill.  Creatures
    that have a natural swimming movement rate get +8 to their Swim
    skill.  These bonuses are now coded in the skill entry 
    however so we do not need to enter them in the race file.
</p>
<p>
    We apply these racial skill bonuses using the
    <code>BONUS:SKILL</code>
    tag.  You can use this tag for a
    single skill, or multiple ones separated by commas as long as the
    bonus value is the same for each skill.  If there are two
    skills with two different bonus values, you have to use two
    separate
    <code>BONUS:SKILL</code>
    tags.
</p>
<p>
    To indicate that these are Racial bonuses we add
    "
    <code>|TYPE=Racial</code>
    " to the end of the tags.
</p>
<p>
    Reading through the Solar write-up we discover that they do not
    get any racial bonuses to skills.
</p>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey, I'm going to give them a +4 racial bonus
    to both Balance and Jump checks.  Our tag for this would
    be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:SKILL|Balance,Jump|4|TYPE=Racial</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The "hidden" bonuses referred to above are explicitly spelled out
    in the RSRD.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>MFEAT</code>
    </strong>
    (
    <span class="new">
    Deprecated
   </span>
    ) This tag is no longer supported by
    PCGen.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    The PCGen data team is moving away from
    using the "Default Monster" setting.  Default Monster Kits are
    being used instead.
</p>
<p>
    To grant racial feats we use the
    <code>MFEAT</code>
    tag. 
    This is very similar to the
    <code>MONCSKILL</code>
    tag in that the
    tag is followed by a list (of feats instead of skills) separated by
    the pipe character.
</p>
<p>
    To determine a race's feats we simply look in the "Feats"
    section of their listing.
</p>
<p>
    A couple of things to pay special attention to when entering
    feats using the
    <code>MFEAT</code>
    tag:  Often a race will
    have a feat multiple times, but with a different target, such as
    Weapon Focus with their claws and their bite.  This would be
    entered as a single entry with two targets, like this: 
    Weapon  Focus(Bite,Claw).
</p>
<p>
    It should also be noted that there should be no space between
    the feat name and the left paren.  This is true whenever you
    reference a feat with a target, in any kind of .lst file.
</p>
<p>
    Our entry using this tag for the Solar would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>MFEAT:Cleave|Dodge|Great Cleave|Improved
            Initiative|Mobility|Power Attack</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The racial feats for a Solar in the RSRD are coded as
    follows:
    <br/>
    MFEAT:Cleave|Dodge|Great Cleave|Improved
    Initiative|Improved Sunder|Mobility|Power Attack|Track
    <br/>
    No feats were listed in the original Ninja Monkey writeup so I
    selected Alertness and Improved Initiative.  This would be
    coded as:
    <br/>
    MFEAT:Alertness|Improved Initiative
    <br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        CR
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    The CR tag is used to set the challenge rating for the race. It
    takes the form of CR:&lt;number&gt;. A creature with a challenge
    rating of 4 would get a "CR:4" tag. One with a challenge rating of
    1/2 would get "CR:1/2".
</p>
<p>
    The Solar has a challenge rating of 19, so the tag would read
    "
    <code>CR:19</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey has a challenge rating of 2, so his tag would
    read "
    <code>CR:2</code>
    ".
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Solar's challenge rating in the RSRD is 23 so the tag would be
    "CR:23".
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>PREALIGN</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Next up is our race's alignment.  In many cases while a
    certain race might lean towards one alignment, they don't always
    have to be that alignment.  The key word to look for when
    creating LST files and doing alignments is "always".  Looking
    at the alignment entry for a Solar, we see that is says "Always
    good (any)".  So we need to restrict the alignments available
    to the race to the 'good' ones.
</p>
<p>
    To set the alignment a creature MUST be, we use the PREALIGN
    tag.  The format is "PREALIGN:#,#,#" and the requirement is
    that the race be one of the listed alignments.
</p>
<p>
    The alignments have been defined by numbers as follows: 0
    (Lawful Good), 1 (Lawful Neutral), 2 (Lawful Evil),  3
    (Neutral Good), 4 (True Neutral), 5 (Neutral Evil), 6 (Chaotic
    Good), 7 (Chaotic Neutral), 8 (Chaotic  Evil).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    In PCGen versions after 5.7.6 you can
    (and should) use the two letter abbreviations for alignments:
    LG,LN,LE,NG,TN,NE,CG,CN,CE.
</p>
<p>
    Since the Solars must be of good alignment, the tag for them
    will read "
    <code>PREALIGN:0,3,6</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey race is usually Chaotic Good, but not always,
    so we will simply not put in a PREALIGN tag for them.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        HITDICEADVANCEMENT
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    We use the HITDICEADVANCEMENT tag for those races that change
    size as their hitdice change. It takes the format of
    HITDICEADVANCEMENT:#,#,#. The "#" should be replaced by the number
    corresponding to the last number of HD for that size. For a race
    that was Small from 3-4 HD, Medium from 5-6 HD and Large from 7-10
    HD the tag would read "HITDICEADVANCEMENT:4,6,10".
</p>
<p>
    When the race advances by class or has no advancement listed
    this tag should be left out.
</p>
<p>
    The solar shows an advance of 22-33 for Large size and 34-66 for
    Huge. So the tag for him will be
    "
    <code>HITDICEADVANCEMENT:33,66</code>
    "
</p>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey, he's advances by character class, so will
    get no HITDICEADVANCEMENT tag.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        LEVELADJUSTMENT
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    The LEVELADJUSTMENT tag is used for those races that might
    conceivably be used as player characters to keep them in balance
    with all the regular PCs.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar is such a high-level creature that it does not have a
    level adjustment.
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey, due to his several small special abilities
    would get a +2 level adjustment, so his tag would read
    "
    <code>LEVELADJUSTMENT:2</code>
    ".
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>FAVCLASS</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use the FAVLASS tag to set a race's favored class.  The
    Solar doesn't have one, so we'll skip this tag for them, but I want
    the Ninja Monkey favored class to be Monk.
</p>
<p>
    On the Ninja Monkey line I put in a tab or two and then
    enter:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>FAVCLASS:Monk</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>LANGAUTO</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Many races get certain languages automatically by the simple
    virtue of being of that race.  To grant these languages to the
    races we create we use the LANGAUTO tag.  Immediately
    following the tag is a comma delimited list of the languages the
    race receives.
</p>
<p>
    Looking at the Solar listing, it says nothing about languages in
    the specific description, but again in the general section about
    all celestials, it says they speak Celestial, Infernal and
    Draconic.  So our LANGAUTO tag for them will look like
    this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>LANGAUTO:Celestial,Infernal,Draconic</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey I think the only two languages I'll grant
    them automatically are their own Monkey  language and Common,
    so their tag will look like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>LANGAUTO:Common,Monkey</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>LANGBONUS</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Races that can be player character races generally also have a
    number of bonus languages that the creature can pick from when
    spending its Int-based language picks.  The tag for this works
    just like the
    <code>LANGAUTO</code>
    tag.
</p>
<p>
    Since the Solar can't really be a player character no bonus
    languages are listed so we skip this tag.
</p>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey I will grant them Elven, Goblin, and Sylvan
    as their bonus languages.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>LANGBONUS:Elven,Goblin,Sylvan</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>LEGS</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The LEGS tag is used to denote the number of legs a creature
    has. PCGen uses this in the calculation of what the
    load/encumbrance ranges for a race are. Sometimes the description
    of the race will tell you how many legs it has, sometimes you have
    to just refer to the pictures provided. :p
</p>
<p>
    Both the Solar and our Ninja Monkey have two legs, so the tag
    for both races will be "
    <code>LEGS:2</code>
    ".
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        HANDS
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    The HANDS tag is used to denote the number of hands a creature
    has. This is used to determine how many weapons it can hold. When
    you go to the equipping screen it will offer to let you equip
    weapons to your primary hand and also show a location for each
    secondary hand. So a creature with four hands could equip one
    weapon as primary and three as secondary. This tag has no affect on
    a race's natural attacks.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar and our Ninja Monkey both have two hands, so our tag
    for both races would be "
    <code>HANDS:2</code>
    "
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        SPELLS
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    The
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag is used to grant innate spellcasting
    (and some spell-like abilities). We use it for spell-like abilities
    when they grant the full spell effect. If it is restricted in some
    way (some races can use a summon monster spell but only to summon a
    certain creature, etc.), we simply list it as an SA.
</p>
<p>
    Alternately, you can create a version of the spell with the
    modifications the race needs included in the description.  The
    spell should be added with no
    <code>CLASS</code>
    or
    <code>DOMAIN</code>
    tags.  Once the spell is created you can
    use the
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    as normal.
</p>
<p>
    The format is SPELLS:&lt;name of spellbook&gt;|TIMES=&lt;times
    per day&gt;|CASTERLEVEL=&lt;level the spell is cast at&gt;|&lt;name
    of spell&gt;,&lt;DC of spell&gt;|&lt;name of spell&gt;,&lt;DC of
    spell&gt;|etc... If you put a "-1" in the times per day slot that
    means that they can use the spell at will, and on output, "At Will"
    will appear in the spell listing. For the spellbook name, we
    usually use "Innate" for racial spells.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar has a whole listing of spells, so the tag for them
    would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=-1|CASTERLEVEL=20|Aid|Animate
            Objects|Commune|Continual Flame|Dimensional Anchor|Greater
            Dispelling|Holy Smite,21|Imprisonment|Improved Invisibility (Self
            Only)|Lesser Restoration|Remove Curse|Remove Disease|Remove
            Fear|Resist Elements|Summon Monster VII|Speak with Dead
            <br/>
            SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=3|CASTERLEVEL=20|Blade
            Barrier,23|Earthquake,25|Heal|Permanency|Resurrection|Shapechange,
            <br/>
            SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=20|Greater Restoration|Mass
            Charm,25|Power Word (Blind),25|Power Word (Kill),26|Power Word
            (Stun),24|Prismatic Spray,24|Symbol,24|Wish</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey has one very simple spell-like ability and that
    is Pass without Trace at will. The monster description does not
    specify a caster level for the ability so we will leave that field
    blank.  The tag would then look like:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=-1|Pass Without Trace</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        SOURCEPAGE
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    This is just what it seems, where we indicate the page from the
    source material where you can find the text and stats for the
    race.
</p>
<p>
    When you are going from an OGL book the format is usually
    SOURCEPAGE:p.#
</p>
<p>
    If you are working from an online document such as the SRD, it
    would be the filename, so SOURCEPAGE:&lt;filename&gt;/
</p>
<p>
    For the solar, we pulled him from the SRD so his tag would be
    "
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:srdmonstersc.rtf</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja Money is from my custom races file, so Il make the tag
    for him "
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:customraces.txt</code>
    ".

    Well, this brings to a close the lessons on creating monster
    races for use in PCGen. Hopefully everything I've talked about has
    made sense to you all. :)
