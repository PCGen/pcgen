    The deity files are used to set up and describe
    the deities that provide the divine inspiration for your game
    setting. Unfortunately, the RSRD does not include any deities and
    therefore PCGen does not provide any, at least 'out of the box'.
    That means you will have to either create your own deities within
    PCGen or input them from any of the many commercial sources
    available in order to take advantage of the special powers and
    spells granted to clerics through the various deities and the
    domains they oversee. To that end, with this lesson I will be
    showing you the ins and outs of deity LST coding.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The material will be broken down into three
    sections, the first of which will introduce you to the basic tags
    required to create a useful deity within PCGen, including some tags
    that are used by PCGen in files other than the deity file. The
    second section will cover additional tags that will help flesh out
    the detail for your deities, providing descriptive text that will
    help identify what the deity is about as well as in selecting the
    right one for the character. The third section will cover the tags
    used to provide the proper source identification for the encoded
    deities. For those of you that have gone through the previous LST
    Classes, some of the global tags, especially the last section, will
    be repetitive. Feel free to skip those tag descriptions if you
    like. These classes are being written for the new LST-coder, so
    there will be some overlap, but a student of the classes does not
    need to take them in order.
</p>
<h3>
    Example Deities
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    As I stated above, there are no deities listed
    in the RSRD from which to draw examples from but there is an
    example in the my_deities.lst file which can be found inside PCGen.
    For additional examples, and to stay clear of any copyright issues,
    I have created two completely copyright free sample deities from
    which to build this class material.

<h3>
    Section 1: The Basics
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    This section will introduce you to the tags
    required to implement a simple deity within PCGen. That is, the
    minimum set of tags needed to implement a deity within PCGen.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    &lt;Deity Name&gt;
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    The deity file is currently a *.lst file that
    has one deity entry per line. The first thing on each line must be
    the name of the deity. There is no tag for it as the program
    assumes that whatever is at the beginning of the line is the name
    of a deity. This means that the entries into our data file begin as
    follows:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>MoSaT</code>
    &lt;TAB&gt;
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Thalia</code>
    &lt;TAB&gt;
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    DOMAINS
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        Tag Format:
    </strong>
    <code>DOMAINS:&lt;domain list&gt;</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag sets the domains the deity makes
    available to divine casters. The text following the tag is a
    comma-delimited list of domain names with no spaces included. It is
    important that the domains listed must be defined in a
    <span class="lstfile">
    domain.lst
   </span>
    file that has been loaded into PCGen.
    When making your own deity, you may include as many domains as you
    wish, though prudence may dictate limiting the number for if a
    deity has all domains, which can be done by simply using
    <code>ALL</code>
    as the sole argument, there is no need for
    additional deities, and what fun would that be.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag may be used as an
    optional tag added at the end of the domain list, separated by a
    pipe (|). These prerequisites are checked against the divine caster
    to determine if he/she is allowed to select the domains listed in
    that particular
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tag. Typically, the
    <code>PREALIGN</code>
    tag is used to restrict what alignments a
    cleric/class with access to domains can be to have access to the
    domains. For more depth on
    <code>PREALIGN</code>
    syntax and usage
    itself, scroll down a bit. It can be used by itself on the line
    (with slightly different meaning for the user) and is explained
    more in depth there.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    PCGen provides some flexibility in how the
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tags are applied, allowing some fairly complex
    application, but most usage of this tag is fairly simple so you
    might just skip over the next paragraph. On the other, if you wish
    to explore this flexibility, the following explanation can get you
    started.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    When using the
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tags at the
    end of the
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tag, all domains listed in that tag
    will be restricted if the
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag isn't satisfied.
    Fortunately, PCGen allows the placement of multiple
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tags in the same deity line, and each
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tag can have its own
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag,
    or none at all. With multiple
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tags, the
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tags are applied only to the domains included
    in that specific
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tag but all domains included
    in each
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tags are made available to the divine
    caster, that is if the appropriate prerequisites have been
    satisfied.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    At this point we are ready to build the
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tags for our two example deities.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
   <span class="lstobj">
    MoSaT
   </span>
    is listed as
    having the domains of
    <span class="lstobj">
    Chaos
   </span>
    ,
    <span class="lstobj">
    Knowledge
   </span>
    , and
    <span class="lstobj">
    Animal
   </span>
    , so this tag will appear as
    <code>DOMAINS:Chaos,Knowledge,Animal</code>
    . If we wish to restrict
    the selection of the
    <span class="lstobj">
    Chaos
   </span>
    domain to
    only those divine casters who are chaotic, we can break the
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tag into the following two tags:
    <code>DOMAINS:Chaos|PREALIGN:CG,CN</code>
    &lt;tab&gt;
    <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Animal</code>
    .
</p>
<p class="indent0">
   <span class="lstobj">
    Thalia
   </span>
    is listed as
    having the domains of
    <span class="lstobj">
    Good
   </span>
    ,
    <span class="lstobj">
    Knowledge
   </span>
    , and
    <span class="lstobj">
    Poetry
   </span>
    , so this tag will appear as
    <code>DOMAINS:Good,Knowledge,Poetry</code>
    . If we wish to restrict
    the selection of the
    <span class="lstobj">
    Good
   </span>
    domain to
    only those divine casters who are good, we can break the
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tag into the following two tags:
    <code>DOMAINS:Good|PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG</code>
    &lt;tab&gt;
    <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Poetry</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>MoSaT</code>
    &lt;TAB&gt; . . .

    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tags.)

    This tag identifies the alignment of the deity.
    The generally accepted entries in the text field are

    <code>LN</code>

    <code>LE</code>

    <code>NE</code>

    <code>CE</code>
    representing the following alignments: Lawful
    Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral,
    Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil. This
    tag isn't strictly necessary, but is used in
    <code>PREDEITYALIGN</code>
    tag, and a few other places, so we are
    including it with the critical tags.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    If you examine the stat blocks for our example
    deities, you will find each lists an alignment: "Chaotic Good" for
    <span class="lstobj">

    <span class="lstobj">
    Thalia

<p class="indent0">
    This tag establishes a restriction, based on the
    electing character's alignment, on which deities may be selected.
    This tag, in conjunction with the
    <code>DOMAINS</code>
    tag,
    replaces the functionality of the
    <code>FOLLOWERALIGN</code>
    tag,
    which, as it has been deprecated, isn't being covered in this
    class.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The argument for this tag is a comma-delimited
    list of alignments by abbreviation. The accepted entries in the
    text field are
    <code>LG</code>
    ,
    <code>NG</code>

    <code>CG</code>

    representing the following
    alignments: Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful
    Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil
    and Chaotic Evil. These abbreviations are defined in the
    <span class="lstfile">
    statsandchecks.lst
   </span>
    file in the Game
    Mode section of the PCGen documentation. There is one additional
    'alignment' which can be included. That is
    <code>Deity</code>
    ,
    which simply refers back to the selected deity's own alignment.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    If you examine the stat blocks for our example
    deities, you will find each includes a "Cleric"s Alignment" listed.
    MoSaT's clerics must be Neutral Good, Chaotic Good and Chaotic
    Neutral while Thalia's clergy must be Lawful Good, Neutral Good,
    True Neutral, or Chaotic Good. Using the syntax described above and
    the appropriate abbreviations, we get the tag implementations
    listed below.

    </strong>
    <code>DEITYWEAP:&lt;favored weapon&gt;</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag provides the deity's favored weapon.
    This entry is a pipe-delimited (|) list of weapon proficiencies
    (defined in
    <span class="lstfile">
    weaponprof.lst
   </span>
    file, or
    the tag won't really do anything.) This is included with the basic
    tags because, unlike purely descriptive tags, this information is
    used in the game mechanics, at least in a minor way. The easiest
    example is if a character is a cleric for a deity of war, that
    being a deity that has the
    <span class="lstobj">
    War
   </span>
    domain
    as one of his domains, and if that cleric has chosen the
    <span class="lstobj">
    War
   </span>
    domain as one of his domains, then
    proficiency with the deity's favored weapon is automatically
    granted. Note that it is important that any favored weapon for a
    deity with the
    <span class="lstobj">
    War
   </span>
    domain must be
    included in at least one of the loaded datasets. The game mechanic
    is also there for other bonuses and checks to see that the
    character has the Deity's favored weapon, but that is more advanced
    stuff, so we'll leave that for a different class.

<p class="indent0">
    Examining the stat blocks for our deities, we
    find
    <span class="lstobj">
    MoSaT
   </span>
    uses 'Tiger Claws' while
    <span class="lstobj">
    Thalia
   </span>
    uses the 'Shepherd's Crook'. The
    implementation of this tag for our deities is shown below.

<p class="indent0">
    Well, this wraps up part 1 of this class. With
    the info above, you can create a basic deity and give it enough
    functionality to bring it to life for your cleric's, and the
    party's enjoyment.

<h3>
    Section 2: Filling in the Detail
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    In the previous section we covered the minimum
    set of tags required to properly implement a deity in PCGen. In
    this section we will be covering the tags that are used to flesh
    out your deities by providing additional detail. The additional
    detail is used primarily to allow for different ways in which to
    sort the deities during the character generation procedure, as well
    as adding flavor to your game. No game mechanics use these tags
    directly. You will also find that these tags are very simple to
    implement.

    <code>PANTHEON:&lt;pantheon name&gt;</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag establishes the pantheon to which the
    deity belongs. Examples of these pantheons are the standard racial
    pantheons (i.e. Elven, Dwarven, etc.), historical pantheons (i.e.
    Greek/Olympian, Roman, Scandinavian/Aesir, etc) or
    campaign/homebrew pantheons. In practical use, this tag is used to
    allow deities to be sorted during character generation, in this
    case, by the pantheon that it belongs to.

<p class="indent0">
    The deity stat blocks above list the pantheon
    for

<p class="indent0">
    This tag provides the deity's descriptive title,
    providing an element of storytelling, or flavor to your game. The
    argument for the tag is a simple text entry. For our two deities
    you will find the title listed just beneath the deity's name, thus
    <span class="lstobj">
    MoSaT
   </span>
    is called 'The CONTENTed One' and
    <span class="lstobj">
    Thalia
   </span>

    This tag provides the deity's descriptive
    appearance and implementing it for our two deities is simple. The
    argument, the descriptive appearance, is a simple text entry. For
    our two deities you will find the appearance included with the
    general description. Its a simple matter to review the text and
    extract the simplest physical description you can. You can see the

    This tag provides a list of the deity's typical
    worshipers; whether by class, race, occupation, eye color,
    speech-pattern, etc. All text following the tag up to the next
    &lt;TAB&gt; or &lt;RETURN&gt; is assumed to be a descriptive list
    of these typical worshipers. This tag is not referenced by
    anything; it is purely descriptive.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    To implement this tag for our two deities you
    can find the typical worshipers listed in the stat blocks
    identified by the 'Worshipers' label . . . imagine that! You can
    see the implementation of this tag in the examples below.

<p class="sidebar1">
    NOTE: The astute student will note that the
    <code>WORSHIPPERS</code>
    tag is misspelled. That may be so but that
    is the way the tag is in fact spelled within the program, so please
    conform to the misspelling ... at least until we can fix it in the

    Section 3: The Rest of the Story

<p class="indent0">
    If you are building homebrew data sets you can
    skip this section, as you will not need the following tags. If, on
    the other hand, you are planning on making lots of personal
    datasets for books you own they are useful. If you are building
    datasets as a PCGen Data Monkey, they are very important so please
    bear with me and we'll get through this as quickly as possible.

<p class="sidebar1">
    Note: It is very likely that if you have gone
    through any of the other *.lst classes you have seen these tags
    before and do not need to suffer through this particular session .
    . . I promise ninja228 will not come by in the middle of your next
    LSTing session to exact punishment for not reading through it . . .
    unless of course you violate the rules of LSTing . . . then you're
    on your own!

        Tag Format:
    </strong>
    <code>DESCIP:&lt;YES or NO&gt;</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag is used to identify the deity
    description text as either 'Product Identity' or not. What is
    product identity (PI)? That's a very good questions that any lawyer
    can answer for you for a mere $150 per hour, unless of course you
    have abused the same PI, not recommended, in which case you will
    likely have to pay a lot more.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    PI, in a nutshell, is material that has not been
    released under the Open Gamers License (OGL). Inclusion of any PI
    requires separate permission from the publisher that owns the
    material. If you are coding a deity from a source for the PCGen
    Project and you have PI, also called 'Closed Content', that
    material needs to be identified as such within the lst file. If you
    have any questions concerning the material you are lsting, feel
    free to consult with any member of PCGen's Data License Team. They
    can help to clarify any confusion.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    As for this tag itself, it is fairly simple to
    implement as the argument for the tag is a simple boolean and will
    take only
    <code>YES</code>
    or
    <code>NO</code>
    as values. For our
    sample deities, the first created as an example in the
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_deity.lst
   </span>
    file, and the other created
    out-of-thin-air for this lst class, the descriptions are not PI;
    therefore, we would implement this tag as
    <code>DESCISPI:NO</code>
    .
    Or we would if it was really necessary for if the tag is not
    included PCGen defaults to
    <code>NO</code>
    so we won't actually
    include the tag in our deity file.

    <strong>
        Tag Format:
    </strong>
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;source page number&gt;</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Simply put, this tag provides the specific page
    reference within the source from which the deity information was
    taken. The source page text generally takes the form of
    <code>&lt;p.#&gt;</code>
    with the pound sign (#) being replaced by
    the page number on which the deity information can be found within
    the source material. For our sample deity
    <span class="lstobj">
    MoSaT
   </span>
    , the source material is PCGen's
    <span class="lstobj">
    my_deity.lst
   </span>
    file so our
    <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
    tag will take the form of
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:my_deity.lst</code>
    . As
    for
    <span class="lstobj">
    Thalia
   </span>
    , our invented-from-thin-air
    deity, there is no source page, but many functions and filters in
    PCGen use it, so it is good to include it. Therefore, we will
    include the tag with an
    <code>n/a</code>
    for the source page.
