Smith (Maredudd) and Andrew McDougall (Tir Gwaith)</p>		<p class="indent0"><strong>File Covered</strong>: *_deities.lst</p>		<p class="indent0"><b>Tags Used:</b></p>		<p class="indent1"><code><a href="../datafilestagpages/datafilesdeities.html#DOMAINS">DOMAINS</a></code>,		<code><a href="">ALIGN</a></code>,		<code><a href="">DEITYWEAP</a></code>,		<code><a href="">PANTHEON</a></code>,		<code><a href="">TITLE</a></code>,		<code><a href="">APPEARANCE</a></code>,		<code><a href="">WORSHIPPER</a></code>,		<code><a href="">DESCISIP</a></code>,		<code><a href="">SOURCEPAGE</a></code></p>		<hr>				<p>The deity files are used to set up and describe the deities that provide 		the divine inspiration for your game setting. Unfortunately, the RSRD		does not include any deities and therefore PCGen does not provide		any, at least 'out of the box'. That means you will have to either create 		your own deities within PCGen or input them from any of the many commercial 		sources available in order to take advantage of the special powers and 		spells granted to clerics through the various deities and the domains they 		oversee. To that end, with	this lesson I will be showing you the 		ins-and-outs of deity LST-ing.</p>				<p>The material will be broken down into three sections, the first of which				will	introduce you to the basic tags required to create a				useful deity	within	PCGen, including some tags that				are used by PCGen in files other than the deity file. The				second section will cover additional tags that will help flesh				out the detail for your deities, providing descriptive text				that	will help identify what the deity is about				as well as in selecting the right one for the character. The				third	section	will	cover	the	tags	used	to provide				the proper	source	identification	for the	encoded	deities.				For those of	you that	have gone through the previous LST				Classes, some	of the global	tags, especially	the last				section, will be repetitive. Feel	free to skip				those tag descriptions if you like. These	classes	are being				written for	the	new LST-coder, so there will be some overlap,				but	a student	of	the	classes does	not need				to take 	them in order.</p>			    <h3><b>Example Deities</b></h3>	    		<p>As I stated above, there are no deities listed in the RSRD from which 		to draw examples from but there is an example in the my_deities.lst file 		which can be found inside PCGen. For additional examples, and to stay 		clear of any copyright issues, I have created two completely copyright 		free sample deities from which to build this class material.</p>				<h4 class="indent1"><strong>MoSaT</strong></h4>				<p class="indent1">The CONTENTed One<br>		Demigod<br>		<strong>Pantheon</strong>: BoD<br>		<strong>Symbol</strong>: A Kitten on a Keyboard<br>		<strong>Alignment</strong>: Chaotic Good<br>		<strong>Portfolio</strong>: PCGen Datasets<br>		<strong>Worshipers</strong>: LST Monkeys<br>		<strong>Cleric's Alignment</strong>: NG,  CG, CN<br>		<strong>Domains</strong>: Chaos, Knowledge, Animal<br>		<strong>Favored Weapon</strong>: Tiger Claws<br>		<strong>Description</strong>: The great content provider.  He is usually seen		as a small<br>		simian stooped over a wireless keyboard typing madly as he travels		<br>		the world		setting all	knowledge	down in the LSTs.</p>		<p></p>		<h4 class="indent1">Thalia</h4>		<p class="indent1">The Flourishing one<br>		Lesser Deity<br>		<strong>Pantheon:</strong> Olympian<br>		<strong>Symbol</strong>: A Shepherds Crook upholding a Comic Mask<br>		<strong>Alignment</strong>: Neutral Good<br>		<strong>Portfolio</strong>: Comedy, Pastoral Poetry<br>		<strong>Worshipers</strong>: Comedians and Pastoral Poets<br>		<strong>Cleric's Alignmen</strong>t: LG, NG, TN, CG<br>		<strong>Domains</strong>: Good, Knowledge, Poetry<br>		<strong>Favored Weapon</strong>: Shepherd's Crook<br>		<strong>Description</strong>: The muse of comedy and of playful and idyllic poetry, <br>		Thalia inspires 		those so inclined to produce great works of comedy <br>		as 		well as peaceful, and pastoral, works of poetry. 		She is sometimes <br>		seen with a crown of ivy and a shepherds crook.</p>				<p>A quick note on a few general conventions used within this class before		we jump	into it:</p>				<p>1) I have used the angle brackets, 'Less Than' and 'Greater Than' symbols,		to indicate where your text will be entered when building a deity		file. Unless explicitly stated in the text of my explanation,		you will not	include		the	angle brackets in your tags.</p>		<p>2) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified by <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> style.</p>		<p>3) When referencing a specific PCGen object, i.e. deity, feat, weapon,		etc., I have included the name as <strong><em>EMPHASISED</em></strong> text,		except	for	when the object is part of a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> example.</p>		<p>Without further adieu, lets jump right into the lesson.</p>		<p></p><hr>				<h3>Section 1: The Basics</h3>				<p>This section will introduce you to the tags required to implement a				simple	deity	within PCGen. That is, the minimum set of tags				needed	to implement	a deity within PCGen.</p>				<hr>		<p><code><strong>&lt;Deity Name&gt;</strong></code></p>		<p>The deity file is currently a *.lst file that has one deity entry per line. The first thing on each line must be the name of the deity. There is no tag for it as the program assumes that whatever is at the beginning of the line is the name of a deity. This means that the entries into our data file begin as follows:</p>		<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt;</p>		<p><code>Thalia </code>&lt;TAB&gt;</p>		<p></p><hr>				<p><code><strong>DOMAINS</strong></code></p>		<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong>	<code>DOMAINS:&lt;domain list&gt;</code></p>		<p>This tag sets the domains the deity makes available to divine casters.		The text following the tag is a comma-delimited list of domain		names with no spaces included. It is important that the		domains listed must	be	defined	in a <em><strong>domain.lst</strong></em> file		that has been loaded into PCGen. When making your own deity,		you may	include	as many domains as you	wish,		though prudence may dictate limiting the number for if a deity		has all domains, which can be done by simply using <code>ALL</code> as		the sole argument, there	is	no	need	for additional deities,		and	what	fun	would that	be.</p>		<p>The <code>PRExxx</code> tag may be used as an optional tag added at the		end of the domain	list, separated by a pipe (|). These prerequisites		are checked	against the divine caster to determine if he/she		is allowed to	select the domains listed in that particular		<code>DOMAINS</code> tag. Typically, the <code>PREALIGN</code> tag is used		to restrict what  alignments a cleric/class with access to domains can		be to have access to the 		domains. For more depth on <code>PREALIGN</code> syntax and usage itself, scroll		down a bit. It can be used by itself on the line (with slightly different		meaning	for the 		user) and is explained more in depth there. </p>		<p>PCGen provides some flexibility in how the <code>DOMAINS</code> tags are				applied, allowing	some fairly complex application, but most usage				of	this	tag is fairly simple				so	you	might	just	skip	over the next paragraph. On				the	other,	if	you wish to explore this flexibility, the following				explanation	can get you started.				</p>		<p>When using the <code>PRExxx</code> tags at the end of the <code>DOMAINS</code> tag,				all	domains listed	in	that tag								will be restricted	if the <code>PRExxx</code> tag isn't satisfied. Fortunately,								PCGen allows	the placement of multiple <code>DOMAINS</code> tags in the								same	deity line,	and each <code>DOMAINS</code> tag can have its own <code>PRExxx</code> tag,								or none at	all. With multiple <code>DOMAINS</code> tags, the <code>PRExxx</code> tags								are applied	only to the domains included in that								specific <code>DOMAINS</code> tag								but	all domains included in each <code>DOMAINS</code> tags								are made available to the divine caster, that								is if the	appropriate	prerequisites have been								satisfied.</p>		<p>At this point we are ready to build the <code>DOMAINS</code> tags for our two example		deities.</p>		<p><strong><em>MoSaT</em></strong> is listed as having the domains of <em><strong>Chaos</strong></em>, <em><strong>Knowledge</strong></em>,		and <em><strong>Animal</strong></em>, so		this tag will appear as <code>DOMAINS:Chaos,Knowledge,Animal</code>. If we		wish to restrict the selection of the <em><strong>Chaos</strong></em> domain		to only those	divine casters who are chaotic, we can break		the <code>DOMAINS</code> tag into the following two tags: <code>DOMAINS:Chaos|PREALIGN:CG,CN</code>		  &lt;tab&gt;		<code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Animal</code>.</p>		<p><em><strong>Thalia</strong></em> is listed as having the domains of <em><strong>Good</strong></em>, <em><strong>Knowledge</strong></em>,		and <em><strong>Poetry</strong></em>,		so this tag will appear as <code>DOMAINS:Good,Knowledge,Poetry</code>.		If we	wish to restrict the selection of the <em><strong>Good</strong></em> domain		to only those divine casters who are good, we		can	break	the <code>DOMAINS</code> tag		into the following two tags: <code>DOMAINS:Good|PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG</code> &lt;tab&gt; <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Poetry</code></p>		<p><b>Example:</b></p>		<p><code>MoSaT </code>&lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> DOMAINS:Chaos,Knowledge,Animal</code> (without		the <code>PRExxx</code> tags.)</p>		<p><code></code><code>MoSaT </code>&lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> DOMAINS:Chaos|PREALIGN:CG,CN</code> &lt;tab&gt; <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Animal</code> (With				the <code>PRExxx</code> tag.)</p>		<p><code></code><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB &gt;<code> DOMAINS:Good,Knowledge,Poetry						</code>(without <code>PRExxx</code> tags.)</p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB &gt;<code>  <code>DOMAINS:Good|PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG</code> &lt;tab&gt; <code>DOMAINS:Knowledge,Poetry								</code></code>(with <code>PRExxx</code> tags.)</p>		<hr>		<p><strong><code>ALIGN</code></strong></p>	<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>ALIGN:&lt;alignment&gt;</code></p>		<p>This tag identifies the alignment of the deity. The				generally accepted entries in the text field are <code>LG</code>, <code>NG</code>, <code>CG</code>,				<code>LN</code>, <code>TN</code>, <code>CN</code>,	<code>LE</code>, <code>LN</code> and <code>CE</code> representing		the following alignments: Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful		Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil and		Chaotic	Evil. This tag isn't strictly necessary, but is used in <code>PREDEITYALIGN</code>  tag,		and a few other places, so we are including it with the critical	tags.</p>		<p>If you examine the stat blocks for our example deities, you will find each		lists an alignment: 'Chaotic Good' for <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em>, and		'Neutral Good' for		<em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>. Using the appropriate abbreviations, we get		the tag implementations	listed		below.</p>		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>		<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> ALIGN:CG</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> ALIGN:NG</code></p>		<hr><p><strong><code>PREALIGN</code></strong></p>		<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>PREALIGN:&lt;alignment abbreviation&gt;</code></p>		<p>This tag establishes a restriction, based on the electing character's alignment,				on	which	deities may be selected..	This tag, in conjynctions				with the <code>DOMAINS</code> tag,	replaces the functionality of				the <code>FOLLOWERALIGN</code> tag,				which,	as	it has been	deprecated,				isn't	being covered	in				this class.</p>		<p>The argument for this tag is a comma-delimited list of alignments by abbreviation.				The accepted	entries	in	the	text	field	are				<code>LG</code>,	<code>NG</code>, <code>CG</code>, <code>LN</code>,	<code>TN</code>, <code>CN</code>, <code>LE</code>,	<code>LN</code> and	<code>CE</code>	representing				the following	alignments:	Lawful Good,	Neutral	Good,	Chaotic				Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil,				Neutral	Evil and		Chaotic	Evil. These	abbreviations	are	defined	in	the <em>statsandchecks.lst</em>		  file		in	the Game Mode section of the PCGen documentation. There is one		additional 'alignment' which can be included. That is <code>deity</code>, which		simply	refers		back	to		the	selected	deities		own alignment. </p>		<p>If you examine the stat blocks for our example deities, you will find each		includes a 'Cleric's Alignment' listed. <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em>'s clerics		must be neutral-good, chaotic-good		and	chaotic-neutral while <em><strong>Thalia's</strong></em> clergy must be		lawful-good,	neutral-good, true-neutral, or chaotic-good.		Using	the	syntax described above and the appropriate	abbreviations,		we	get	the	tag	implementations	listed	below.</p>		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>		<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> PREALIGN:NG,CG,CN</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> PREALIGN:LG,NG,TN,CG</code></p>		<hr><p><code><strong>DEITYWEAP</strong></code></p>		<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>DEITYWEAP:&lt;favored weapon&gt;</code></p>	<p>This tag<b> </b>provides the deity's favored weapon. This entry is a pipe			(|) delimited 	list of weapon proficiencies (defined in <em><strong>weaponprof.lst</strong></em> file,			 or the tag won't really do anything.) This is included with the			basic tags because, unlike 		purely descriptive tags, this information is used in the game mechanics,			at least in a minor way.  The easiest example is if a character is			a cleric	for a deity of war, that being a deity that has 		the <em><strong>War</strong></em> domain as one of his domains,	and if that		cleric has chosen the 		<strong><em>War</em></strong> domain as one	of his domains, then proficiency		with the deity's  favored weapon is automatically granted. Note that		it is	important that any favored weapon for 		a deity with the <strong><em>War</em></strong> domain must be included in at		least one of the  loaded datasets. The game mechanic is also there for		other	bonuses and checks to see that the 		character has the Deity's favored weapon, but that is more advanced stuff,		so we'll leave for a 	different class.</p>		<p>Examining the stat blocks for our deities, we find <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em> uses 'Tiger Claws' while <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em> uses the 'Shepherds Crook'. The implementation of this tag for our deities is shown below.</p>		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>		<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> DEITWEAP:Tiger Claws</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> DEITWEAP:Shepard Crook</code></p>		<hr>		<p>Well, this wraps up part 1 of this class. With the info above, you can create		a basic deity and give it enough functionality to bring it to life for		your cleric's, and the party's, enjoyment.</p>		<hr>		<h3>Section 2:  Filling in the Detail</h3>	<p>In the previous section we covered the minimum set of tags required to properly		implement a deity in PCGen. In this section we will be covering the tags		that	are used to flesh out your deities by providing additional detail.		The additional detail is used primarily to allow for different ways in		which	to sort the deities		during the character generation procedure, as well as adding flavor to your		game. No game mechanics use these tags directly. You will also find that		these tags are very simple to implement.</p>		<hr>		<p><code><strong>PANTHEON</strong></code></p>		<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>PANTHEON:&lt;pantheon name&gt;</code></p>	    <p>This tag establishes the pantheon to which the deity belongs. Examples		of these pantheons are the standard racial pantheons (i.e. Elven, Dwarven,		etc.),		historical pantheons (i.e. Greek/Olympian, Roman, Scandinavian/Aesir,		etc)	or campaign/homebrew pantheons.  In practical use, this		tag	is	used	to	allow	deities to be sorted during character generation,		in	this	case,	by	the	pantheon	that	it belongs	to.</p>		<p>The deity stat blocks above list the pantheon for <em><strong>MoSaT</strong></em> 		as BoD and for <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>  as 'Olympia', leading to the tag 	implementation listed below.</p>		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>	<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt; <code>PANTHEON:BoD</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt; <code>PANTHEON:Olympia</code></p>		<hr>		<p><strong><code>TITLE</code></strong></p>		<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>TITLE:&lt;descriptive title&gt;</code></p>	<p>This tag provides the deity's descriptive title, providing an element of storytelling,		or flavor to your game. The argument for the tag		is a simple text entry. For our two deities you will find the title listed		just beneath the deity's name, thus <strong><em>MoSaT</em></strong> is called		'The CONTENTed One'	and <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em> is called 'The Flourishing		One'. You can see the implementation	of this tag for each deity below.</p>		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>		<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt; <code>TITLE:The CONTENTed One</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt; <code>TITLE:The Flourishing One</code></p>		<hr>		<p><code><strong>APPEARANCE</strong></code></p>	<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>APPEARANCE:&lt;descriptive appearance&gt;</code></p>		<p>This tag<b> </b>provides the deity's descriptive appearance and implementing		it for our two deities is simple. The argument, the descriptive appearance,		is a simple text entry. For our two deities you will find		the	appearance	included with the general description. Its a simple matter		to review the text and extract the simplest physical description you		can. You can see the implementation of this tag for each		deity	below.</p>		<p><b>Example:</b></p>	<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt; <code>APPEARANCE:He is usually seen as a small		simian stooped over a wireless keyboard	typing madly.</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt; <code>APPEARANCE:She is sometimes seen with		a crown of ivy and a shepherds crook</code></p>		<hr>		<p><code><strong>WORSHIPPERS</strong></code></p>	<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>WORSHIPPERS:&lt;typical worshipers&gt;</code></p>		<p>This tag provides a list of the deity's typical worshipers; whether by		class,	race, occupation, eye color, speech-pattern, etc.  All		text	following	the	tag	up	to	the next &lt;TAB&gt; or &lt;RETURN&gt; is		assumed	to	be a descriptive list of these typical worshipers. This		tag	is not	referenced	by anything;	it is	purely descriptive.</p>		<p>To implement this tag for our two deities you can find the typical worshipers		listed in the stat blocks identified by the  'Worshipers'		label . . . imagine that! You can see the implementation of this tag		in	the	examples	below.</p>		<p>NOTE: The astute student will note that the <code>WORSHIPPERS</code> tag is mis-spelled.				That may be so but that is the way the tag is in fact spelled				within the program, so please conform to the mis-spelling . .				. at least until we can fix it in the code base.</p>		<p><b>Example:</b></p>	<p><code>MoSaT</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt;<code> WORSHIPPERS:LST Monkeys</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia</code> &lt;TAB&gt; . . . &lt;TAB&gt; <code>WORSHIPPERS:Comedians and Pastoral Poets</code></p>		<hr>		<p>This completes section 2 of this class material.  You can now fully encode		any	deity you desire!</p>		<hr>		<h3>Section 3:  The Rest of the Story</h3>	<p>If you are building homebrew data sets you can skip this section, as you			will not need the following tags. If, on the other hand, you are			planning	on making lots of personal datasets for books you own			they are useful.. If you are building datasets as a PCGen Data Monkey,			they	are very important	so please bear with me and we'll get through this as quickly as possible.</p>		<p>Note: It is very likely that if you have gone through any of the other *.lst		classes	you have seen these tags before and do not need to suffer through		this particular session . . . I promise ninja228 will not come by in				the middle of your next LSTing session to exact punishment for not reading				through it .		. . unless of course you violate the rules of LSTing . . . then your				on your own!</p>		<hr>	<p><strong><code>DESCISIP</code></strong></p>		<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong><b> </b><code>DESCIP:&lt;YES or NO&gt;</code></p>		<p>This tag is used to identify the deity description text		as either 'Product Identity' or not.  What is 	product identity		(PI)?  That's a very good questions that any lawyer can answer for you for		a	mere $150 per hour, unless of course you have abused the same 		PI, not recommended, in	which case you will likely have to pay a lot		more.  </p>		<p>PI, in a nutshell, is material that has not been released under		the	Open Gamers License (OGL). Inclusion of any PI requires separate		permission	from the publisher that owns the material. If you are		coding a deity from a source for the PCGen Project and you have		PI, also called 'Closed Content', that	material needs	to be identified		as such within the lst file. If you	have any questions concerning the		material  you are lsting, feel free to consult with any member of PCGen's		OGL	Team. 		They can help to clarify any confusion.</p>		<p>As for this tag itself, it is fairly simple to implement as the argument for		the	tag is	a simple boolean and will take only <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code> as		values. For our sample deities, the first created as an example in the 		<em><strong>my_deity.lst</strong></em> file, and the other created out-of-thin-air 		for this lst class, the descriptions are not PI; therefore, we would implement this 		tag as <code>DESCISPI:NO</code>. Or we would if it was really necessary for if the 		tag is not included PCGen defaults to <code>NO</code> so we won't actually include 		the tag in our deity file.</p>		<hr>	<p><strong><code>SOURCEPAGE</code></strong></p>		<p><strong>Tag Format:</strong> <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;source page text&gt;</code></p>		<p>Simply put, this tag provides the specific page reference within the source		from which the deity information was taken. The source page text generally		takes the form of <code>&lt;p.#&gt;</code> with the pound sign (#) being replaced		by the	page number on which the deity information can be found within		the source	material. For		our	sample	deity <em><strong>MoSat</strong></em>,	the source material is PCGen's			em><strong>my_deity.lst</strong></em>  file		so our<code> SOURCEPAGE</code> tag will take the form of <code>SOURCEPAGE:my_deity.lst</code>.		As for <em><strong>Thalia</strong></em>, our invented-from-thin-air deity,		there is no source page,	but many functions and        		filters in PCGen use it, so it is good to include it. Therefor,        		we will include the tag with an <code>n/a</code> for the source page.</p>		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>		<p><code>MoSaT </code>&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;<code> SOURCEPAGE:my_deity.lst</code></p>		<p><code>Thalia </code>&lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;<code> SOURCEPAGE:n/a</code></p>		<hr>		<h3>Conclusion: The Deity File Entries</h3>		<p>My deity entries now look like this (all on a single line and the tags in		the order that I feel makes most sense.):</p>						<p class="indent1"><code>MoSaT&lt;tab&gt;<br>        TITLE:The CONTENTed One&lt;tab&gt;<br>        PANTHEON:BoD&lt;tab&gt;<br>        ALIGN:CG&lt;tab&gt;<br>        PREALIGN:NG,CG,CN&lt;tab&gt;<br>        DOMAINS:Chaos|PREALIGN:CG,CN&lt;tab&gt;<br>        DOMAINS:Knowledge,Animal&lt;tab&gt;<br>		DEITWEAP:Tiger Claws&lt;tab&gt;<br>		APPEARANCE:He is usually seen as a small simian <br>		stooped over			a wireless keyboard	typing madly.&lt;tab&gt;<br>		WORSHIPPERS:LST Monkeys&lt;tab&gt;<br>		SOURCEPAGE:my_deity.lst</code></p>				<p class="indent1"><code>Thalia&lt;tab&gt;<br>   		TITLE:The Flourishing One&lt;tab&gt; <br>   		PANTHEON:Olympia&lt;tab&gt; <br>   		ALIGN:NG&lt;tab&gt;<br>   		PREALIGN:LG,NG,TN,CG&lt;tab&gt;<br>   		DOMAINS:Good|PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG&lt;tab&gt;<br>   		DOMAINS:Knowledge,Poetry&lt;tab&gt;<br>   		DEITWEAP:Shepherds Crook&lt;tab&gt;<br>   		APPEARANCE:She is sometimes seen with		a crown of ivy <br>		and a shepherds crook.&lt;tab&gt;<br>		WORSHIPPERS:Comedians and Pastoral Poets</code></p>				<p></p><hr>		<p>And that's everything you need to add new deities to your campaign.</p>		<p>Maredudd</p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>&nbsp;		</p>	</body></html>
