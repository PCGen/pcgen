<h2>
    Basic File type calls
</h2>
<p>
    Ok, this part is going to go fast. If you want to add an object
    (coding term for how PCGen handles things), such as a Race, to your
    campaign, it needs to be in the correct LST file type to load
    correctly. To do this, you create that object in a LST file, and
    reference the file by one of the tags. Valid file types are, and
    I'm grouping them by file types that tend to go together (interact
    with others regularly in the same grouping): DEITY, DOMAIN, SPELL,
    RACE, TEMPLATE, FEAT, SKILL, LANGUAGE, CLASS, COMPANIONMOD, KIT,
    EQUIPMOD, EQUIPMENT, and WEAPONPROF
</p>
<p>
    There can only be one of these tags per line, but one can have
    more than one line with the same reference (we tend to break
    monsters and equipment down into more than one file for official
    releases, so we often will have more than one EQUIPMENT or RACE
    line in the same campaign. All of these tags call LST files, each
    of which follow their own format and tags that can be used in them.
    We will get to that later.
</p>
<p>
    For example, one of the lines for my classes is
    "CLASS:mystuffclassesbase.lst". Another one (entered on a new line)
    is "CLASS:mystuffclassesprestige.lst". My feat file is
    "FEAT:mystufffeats.lst".
</p>
<p>
    Notice something about all the filenames I've chosen for the
    different types of data? They all start with "mystuff". This is the
    common naming convention and just makes it easy to determine at a
    glance what files belong together with what PCC.
</p>
<p>
    So now the PCC file looks like this (and is complete; we are
    building on lesson #1 here.):

<p>
    That is ALL you need to include in a Campaign file to have
    objects load, so long as the files themselves exist and there isn't
    anything wrong with the files themselves (bad LST format, weird
    character, etc.). Note that you do not need all of those type.
    Several sources may only have two or three of them.
</p>
<p>
    What we are going to go into now is some slightly more advanced
    items that will help with your custom datasets...
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
    PCC: calling other PCGen Campaign Configuration files.
</h2>
<p>
    Let's say I want to have everything in the SRD, but I don't want
    to select the SRD every time on the sources screen. I and my
    players want to just load MyCampaign. To do this I can use a PCC
    tag in the mystuff.pcc. This works just like any of the other File
    Type loading tags, but it will load EVERYTHING from a given PCC
    file.
</p>
<p>
    So I can load the complete SRD and my own stuff and I could do
    it just by clicking on MyCampaign and loading that. All the info in
    the SRD would be included! More specifically, what is mentioned in
    the PCC I call is loaded as if it were listed in the
    mystuff.pcc...
</p>
<p>
    Since PCC's tend to be in the same folder as their files, and
    each campaign in its own folder, I've held this one off till after
    the calling from other directories, since you need that first. So,
    I need to know where the PCC in question is. In this case, it is
    (PCgenHome}/data/d20ogl/srd/srd.pcc. So I'm going to add
    PCC:@/data/d20ogl/srd/srd.pcc
</p>
<p>
    The "@" character when used in a PCC file will be replaced when
    the program goes looking for the file by the path you have set in
    the preferences as the PCGen home directory.
</p>
<p>
    You may also load a PCC using the full path/filename (useful if
    you keep your sources in places other than the normal PCGen path)
    such as PCC:C:/pcgen/data/d20ogl/srd/srd.pcc.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
    LSTEXCLUDE: removing a file completely.
</h2>
<p>
    I want to use the SRD materials but I have invented my own feats
    and wish to use them and *not* have the ones from the SRD
    available. I can use the LSTEXCLUDE tag to prevent them from being
    loaded. This tag will prevent the named files from being loaded
    even if they are referenced in another PCC that you have chosen to
    include. For this to work properly, it must come before any PCC
    listings to take effect in them.
</p>
<p>
    So, for mystuff.pcc I will insert "LSTEXCLUDE:srdfeats.lst" on a
    line prior to my PCC call from the last section.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
    INCLUDE/EXCLUDE: loading only parts of files
</h2>
<p>
    Thinking about it some more I realize that I want to include a
    couple of bits from some other data sets. While I could re-enter
    them, why go to all that trouble. Looking through my stuff, I want
    to include the races from FFG's Mythic Races... but looking at
    them, I don't particularly like the Fairy race, nor the Anaema
    (that just sounds too close to something else :P) and would like to
    leave them out.
</p>
<p>
    This is what we use the EXCLUDE tag for.  So I enter
    another race tag for that file, but on the end I put
    "|(EXCLUDE:Fairy|Anaema)". The complete entry reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>RACE:@/data/d20ogl/fantasyflightgames/legendsandlairs/mythicraces/mythicracesraces.lst|
            (EXCLUDE:Fairy|Anaema)</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    On that same note, I really like the Hide Spell metamagic feat
    from Sword and Sorcery Studios book Relics and Rituals, but I don't
    want to include any of the other feats. To do this I'll use the
    INCLUDE tag. I enter another feat tag, and at the end I put
    "|(INCLUDE:Hide Spell)". The complete line would read:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>FEAT:@/data/d20ogl/swordandsorcerystudios/scarredlands/relicsrituals/relicsritualsfeats.lst|
            (INCLUDE:Hide Spell)</code>
    </p>

<h2>
    #: Comments
</h2>
<p>
    Some PCC files can be complicated and might need some
    explanation for how things are being done or you may just wish to
    use have some reminders of how you've organized the file.  For
    that you enter a comment. A comment is indicated by using the "#"
    character as the first character on the line, followed by any text
    you wish to enter for the comment.
</p>
<p>
    I think I'll just pop a note into the PCC indicating source
    material that is not from my setting. "# Non My Campaign setting
    files".
</p>
<p>
    Our PCC file now looks like this:
