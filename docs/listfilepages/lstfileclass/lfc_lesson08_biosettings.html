<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>AGESET</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first tag you will see in a biosetting file is the AGESET
    tag. These tags are used to define the age ranges for each
    category. It takes the format of AGESET:#|name. The numbers should
    start with 0 (for the youngest ageset) and go up sequentially from
    there for each grouping you have. So if your game starts at
    adulthood, your first ageset tag would probably look like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>AGESET:0|Adult</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    One other thing may appear in the AGESET line, and that would be
    BONUS tags where you enter any modifiers that affect the
    character's ability scores due to age. A good example of this would
    be the next set up the age line when you hit Middle Age. The AGESET
    line for that age group looks like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>AGESET:1|Middle Age &lt;tab&gt;
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|STR,CON,DEX|-1 &lt;tab&gt;
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|INT,WIS,CHA|1</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    When you choose middle age or change your age to where it falls
    in the middle age category on the description tab in the UI these
    bonuses and penalties (-1 to Strength, Dexterity and Constitution
    and +1 to Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma) will be applied to
    your character.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>RACENAME</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Under the Ageset tag will be the first RACENAME tag. This is
    used to define the race (or races) that the rest of the information
    on the racename line will affect. You may have multiple RACENAME
    lines with the same name as long as they contain different types of
    information (more on this later). As a matter of fact, other than
    the AGESET tag, this is the only other tag that may begin a line in
    a biosettings .lst file.
</p>
<p>
    The way that a RACENAME line can be made to affect multiple
    races is by use of the "%" character with the name, which acts as a
    wildcard character. We use this when there is a race with sub-races
    that all have the same progressions and effects as they age. A
    couple of examples: RACENAME:Dwarf (would affect only races with
    the name of "Dwarf"). "RACENAME:Dwarf%" would affect any race that
    started with the word Dwarf, so "Dwarf (Duergar)" would also be
    affected by whatever information follows this RACENAME tag.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BASEAGEADD</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The BASEAGEADD tag is used inside of the CLASS tag to define the
    spread for randomization in the number that is added to your base
    age for the class(es) it is paired with.
</p>
<p>
    It takes the format of [BASEAGEADD:#d#]. The standard practice
    (since that's how it's done in most books) is to notate this in
    standard dice format. 1d4 would generate a random number between 1
    and 4 to add to the base age, 3d8 would generate a number between 3
    and 24 to add to the base age, etc.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to enter it such that the full range would be
    covered (say 1-24 instead of 3-24). To do this you would simply
    change the entry to 1d24 and it will generate a random number
    between 1 and 24 to add to the character's base age.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>CLASS</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The CLASS tag is somewhat complicated to explain, especially
    because it embeds one of the other tags we'll be discussing within
    it. We use this tag to define the names of the classes that affect
    the age of the character and how much should be added to their base
    age for the class they've chosen. There will only be one
    RACENAME/CLASS line combo for each race represented in the
    biosetting file.
</p>
<p>
    The CLASS tag takes the format of
</p>
<p>
    CLASS:class name1,class name2[BASEAGEADD:#d#]|class name3,class
    name4[BASEAGEADD:#d3]|etc.
</p>
<p>
    So, from the SRD, for a Human the RACENAME/CLASS line would look
    like:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>RACENAME:Human% &lt;tab&gt;
            <br/>
            CLASS:Barbarian,Rogue,Sorcerer[BASEAGEADD:1d4]|Bard,Fighter,Paladin,Ranger[B
            ASEAGEADD:1d6]|Cleric,Druid,Monk,Wizard[BASEAGEADD:2d6]</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BASEHT</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The BASEHT tag is used inside of the SEX tag to define the
    starting point for the height of the race. There will normally be
    two of these for each race. One for the female and one for the
    male.
</p>
<p>
    It takes the format of BASEHT:#. This number needs to be in the
    base units set in the game mode. If you set the base unit to the
    centimeter then a race with a starting height of 160 centimeteres
    would have BASEHT:160. If you set it for meters, it would be
    BASEHT:1.6.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>HTDIEROLL</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The HTDIEROLL tag is used inside of the SEX tag to define the
    spread for randomization in the number that is added to your base
    height for the race/sex it is paired with. It also acts as a
    variable name that contains the result of this randomization.
</p>
<p>
    It takes the format of HTDIEROLL:#d#. This is usually expressed
    in standard dice notation (2d6, 3d4, etc.) but like the other
    randomization tags, you can get the full range by using expressions
    like 1d12, etc.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BASEWT</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The BASEWT tag is used inside of the SEX tag to define the
    starting point for the weight of the race. There will normally be
    two of these for each race. One for the female and one for the
    male.
</p>
<p>
    It takes the format of BASEWT:#. Like the BASEHT, this number
    needs to be in the base units set in the game mode for it to output
    properly.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>WTDIEROLL</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The WTDIEROLL tag is used inside of the SEX tag to define the
    spread for randomization in the number that is added to your base
    weight for the race/sex it is paired with. It also acts as a
    variable name that contains the result of this randomization.
</p>
<p>
    It takes the format of WTDIEROLL:#d#. This is usually expressed
    in standard dice notation (2d6, 3d4, etc.) but like the other
    randomization tags, you can get the full range by using expressions
    like 1d12, etc.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>TOTALWT</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The TOTALWT tag is used inside of the SEX tag to define the
    total weight of your character. It can use standard numbers, as
    well as the BASEWT, WTDIEROLL and HTDIEROLL variables.
</p>
<p>
    An example of the use of this tag from the SRD for the human
    race is TOTALWT:BASEWT+(HTDIEROLL*WTDIEROLL). It would set your
    total weight to the value of your base weight, plus the product of
    the random height and weight rolls.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>SEX</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag uses the previous five tags listed above to define the
    height and weight of a character based on their sex. The tag takes
    the format of SEX:&lt;gender&gt;[sub-tags]&lt;gender&gt;[sub-tags].
    The sub-tags are separated by pipes within the brackets.
</p>
<p>
    An example (again from the SRD):
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>RACENAME:Human%
            <br/>
            SEX:Male[BASEHT:58|HTDIEROLL:2d10|BASEWT:120|WTDIEROLL:2d4|TOTALWT:BASEWT+(HTDIEROLL*WTDIEROLL)]Female[BASEHT:53|HTDIEROLL:2d10|BASEWT:85|WTDIEROLL
            :2d4|TOTALWT:BASEWT+(HTDIEROLL*WTDIEROLL)]</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BASEAGE</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag sets the bottom of the AGESET it is listed under. The
    format is BASEAGE:#. This number also controls the change in
    bonuses if you set your characters age manually. If you go below
    this number, it removes the current bonus for the AGESET you were
    in and applies the previous AGESET bonus statements.
</p>
<p>
    For a race that starts a certain ageset at 35 years, you would
    see:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BASEAGE:35</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>MAXAGE</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag sets the top of the AGESET it is listed under. The
    format is MAXAGE:#. This number also controls the change in bonuses
    if you set your characters age manually. If you go above this
    number, it removes the current bonus for the AGESET you were in and
    applies the next AGESET bonus statements.
</p>
<p>
    For a race that ends a certain ageset at 55 years, you would
    see:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>MAXAGE:55</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>AGEDIEROLL</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag sets the randomization scale for the AGESET it is
    under. The format is AGEDIEROLL:#d#.
</p>
<p>
    Standard practice is to try and fill the range between the
    BASEAGE value and the MAXAGE value in dice notation. So for the
    values of those given above we see the we need a range of 20, so
    our tag would look like:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>AGEDIEROLL:1d20</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>HAIR</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag determines the hair colors used by the randomizer. It
    takes the format of HAIR:color1|color2|color3|etc. Any text you
    wish may be used as a hair color.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>RACENAME:Human% &lt;tab&gt;
            EYES:Hazel|Blue|Brown|Grey|Violet</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>SKINTONE</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This tag determines the skintone colors used by the randomizer.
    It takes the format of SKINTONE:color1|color2|color3|etc. Any text
    you wish may be used as a skintone color.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>RACENAME:Human% &lt;tab&gt;
            SKINTONE:Bronze|Yellow|Red|Pink|Vermillion</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that the last six may be combined on the same RACENAME line
    (and usually are) like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>RACENAME:Human% &lt;tab&gt; HAIR:Blonde|White|Salt &amp;
            Pepper|Plaid
            <br/>
            EYES:Hazel|Blue|Brown|Grey|Violet
            <br/>
            SKINTONE:Bronze|Yellow|Red|Pink|Vermillion</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    After the first ageset where you set all the other randomization
    information, the other agesets are entered. The only things
    contained in these areas should be AGESET (and associated BONUS
    statements), RACENAME, BASEAGE, MAXAGE and AGEDIEROLL. And example
    from the SRD would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>AGESET:1|Middle Age BONUS:STAT|STR,CON,DEX|-1
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|INT,WIS,CHA|1
            <br/>
            RACENAME:Human% BASEAGE:35 MAXAGE:52 AGEDIEROLL:3d6
            <br/>
            RACENAME:Dwarf% BASEAGE:125 MAXAGE:187 AGEDIEROLL:(7d8+1d6)
            <br/>
            RACENAME:Elf% BASEAGE:175 MAXAGE:262 AGEDIEROLL:11d8
            <br/>
            RACENAME:Gnome% BASEAGE:100 MAXAGE:149 AGEDIEROLL:(8d6+1)
            <br/>
            RACENAME:Half-Elf% BASEAGE:62 MAXAGE:92 AGEDIEROLL:5d6
            <br/>
            RACENAME:Half-Orc% BASEAGE:30 MAXAGE:44
            <br/>
            AGEDIEROLL:(1d10+1d4)
            <br/>
            RACENAME:Halfling% BASEAGE:50 MAXAGE:74 AGEDIEROLL:4d6</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    Well now.... isn't that a monster dissertation?!!! I hope
    everyone finds it helpful in creating biosettings files for
    whatever sources you choose to work on. Between this lesson and the
    examples in the PCGen distribution you should have it made.
</p>
<p>
    Best of luck!
