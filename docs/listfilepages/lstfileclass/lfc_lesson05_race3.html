<p>
    This lesson will cover Special Attack and Special Qualities and
    all the tags that are involved in putting them into
    PCGen.  As with most things in PCGen there are a number of
    different ways to accomplish the same thing.  We will try and
    cover the preferred methods and simply note that there maybe other
    ways to do what you want. As always, you should check the
    documentation for more information.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        SA
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    This is the tag we use for any special abilities, attacks or
    qualities the race may have. Things that would be noted here are
    immunities, bonuses to skills that are conditional ("+8 to spot in
    daylight" is a good example of this type) and other things of that
    kind. If the type of special ability/quality is listed it should be
    added in parens. "(Ex)" for extraordinary, "(Sp)" for Spell or
    Spell-like, "(Su)" for supernatural. We wouldn't list anything that
    has a tag like Spell Resistance or Damage Reduction or spells.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar has several abilities such a Aura of Menace,
    Protective Aura, etc. (essentially his celestial qualities) that we
    should list. So his set of SA
    <br/>
    tags (separated by tabs of course) would look like:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>SA:Aura of Menace (Su)
            <br/>
            SA:Magic Circle against Evil (Su)
            <br/>
            SA:Protective Aura (Su)
            <br/>
            SA:Teleport (Su)
            <br/>
            SA:Tongues (Su)
            <br/>
            SA:Immunity to electricity/petrification/cold/acid (Ex)
            <br/>
            SA:Fire resistance 20 (Ex)
            <br/>
            SA:Keen Vision (Ex)</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey is a hardy race so I'll give him immunity to
    poison. Being a monkey, I'll also give him +2 to Hide in forested
    areas. So we would put:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>SA:Posion Immunity (Ex)
            <br/>
            SA:+2 to Hide in forested areas</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Solar's special abilities have changed a little in 3.5. His
    tags would look like:
    <br/>
    <code>SA:Spell-Like Abilities
        <br/>
        SA:Immunity to petrification/cold/acid (Ex)
        <br/>
        SA:Protective Aura (Su)
        <br/>
        SA:Regeneration % (Ex)|Regeneration
        <br/>
        SA:Resistance to Fire 10 (Ex)
        <br/>
        SA:Resistance to Electricity 10 (Ex)
        <br/>
        SA:Tongues (Su)
        <br/></code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>FEAT</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    At times a creature's special abilities have additional behavior
    we would like to encode into the program.  A good example of
    this would be a creature that gets an ability that is the same as a
    class feature, like Sneak Attack or Rage.  These abilities are
    already in PCGen in what is called a "Hidden Feat".  They can
    be found in the file xsrd_feats_hidden.lst.  Basically they
    are exactly like normal feats except they are not visible in the
    GUI so you can't select them as a feat choice for your
    character.  We use the "
    <code>FEAT</code>
    " to grant these
    abilities to a monster. It should be noted that only a single
    "
    <code>FEAT</code>
    " tag can be present in a race line so if
    multiple feats need to be granted they should be separated with a
    "|" (pipe) character.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose we had a variation of our Ninja Monkey race that
    received the Rage special ability as a Barbarian equal to their HD.
    We could code this like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>FEAT:Rage&lt;tab&gt;BONUS:VAR|RageTimesLvl,RagePowerLvl|HD</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>VFEAT</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Similar to the
    <code>FEAT</code>
    tag, the
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    is
    used to grant feats to a creature.  It is generally used to
    grant bonus feats particularly ones that a creature may not
    ordinarily qualify for.  In the creature description in the
    SRD, the feat will be noted as a bonus feat.
</p>
<p>
    Neither the Solar nor our Ninja Monkey have any bonus feats so
    we won't enter anything for either for this tag.
</p>
<p>
    Just to illustrate if we look at the Marilith in the SRD, it is
    noted as having both the Multidexterity and Multiweapon Fighting
    feats as bonus feats.  We would therefore enter:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>VFEAT:Multidexterity&lt;tab&gt;VFEAT:Multiweapon
            Fighting</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    In the RSRD, bonus feats are indicated with a superscript "B" after
    the feat name in the creature's list of feats.
    <br/>
    The Marilith does not get the Mutlidexterity and Mutliweapon
    Fighting feats as bonus feats in 3.5.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>VISION</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use the VISION tag to define the various types of vision a
    creature has.  You can have more than one type of vision
    listed by using "|" (pipe) character to separate them.  That
    makes the tag format "VISION:type  (distance)|type
    (distance)".  Note that the (distance) part is optional.
</p>
<p>
    A creature's vision is (in most cases) defined by the type of
    creature it is, unless it's description states otherwise.  In
    the case of the Solar, it has no information on it's vision in it's
    description, but there is  information in the section about
    ALL Celestials, so we'll use that information. It says that all
    Celestials  have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet and
    Low-light vision.  The tag for the vision of a Solar would
    be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>VISION:Darkvision (60')|Low-light</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey I'm going to classify as a Monstrous Humanoid.
    According to the section on Monstrous  Humanoids in the SRD
    (srdcreatureoverview.rtf), Monstrous Humanoids get Darkvision with
    a range of 60 feet.  Their tag will read:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>VISION:Darkvision (60')</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        SR
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    For races that have Spell Resistance, we use the SR tag. This
    can take a plain number or a formula for those races that get
    better SR with more levels. So SR:12 is valid as is SR:11+TL.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar has a spell resistance of 32, so we would enter
    "
    <code>SR:32</code>
    " for him.
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey has no SR so we'll skip this tag for them.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        DR
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    To indicate Damage Reduction for races we use the DR tag. It
    takes the format of DR:&lt;reduction&gt;|&lt;bonus to bypass&gt;.
    So a creature with a damage reduction of 5 unless you have a +1
    weapon would be "DR:5/+1". For a creature that has damage reduction
    of 10 unless it's a silver weapon you would use "DR:10/Silver". If
    the race gets the damage reduction regardless of what kind of
    weapon is used (such as a high level barbarian gets) you use a "-"
    in the second position.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar has a damage reduction of 35 and only a +4 or better
    weapon can get through it, so the tag would read
    "
    <code>DR:35/+4</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey has a very strong connection with the earth and
    gains a small damage reduction of 3 with no special weapons that
    can ignore it, so the tag would be "
    <code>DR:3/-</code>
    ".
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    In the RSRD the Solar has a damage reduction of 15/epic and evil so
    we would instead enter:
    <br/>
    <code>DR:15/epic and evil</code>
    <br/>
    The Ninja Monkey's DR remains unchanged.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        TEMPLATE
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    We use templates (and the "TEMPLATE" tag) to apply all the
    bonuses that creatures get from being a certain type of creature
    (ie: no CON score for undead, etc.). The standard PCGen
    distribution has templates created for all the creature types that
    are called out in the R/SRD.
</p>
<p>
    The format is TEMPLATE:&lt;templatename&gt;. Despite what the
    documentation says currently, you cannot apply multiple templates
    by using a "|" to separate them, you must use a separate TEMPLATE
    tag for each template you wish to apply.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar is an outsider so we would add a
    "
    <code>TEMPLATE:Outsider</code>
    " to his listing.
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja Monkey is a Monstrous Humanoid and would get
    "
    <code>TEMPLATE:Monstrous Humanoid</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    It is no longer necessary to add a
    template just for the monster's type as it is handled by the
    monster's class. Some templates are still required, like "Mindless"
    for creatures without and Int score or "Incorporeal" for creatures
    without a corporeal form.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BONUS:CHECKS</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    The PCGen data team is moving away from
    using the "Default Monster" setting.  Default Monster Kits are
    being used instead.
</p>
<p>
    Now we are going to deal with coding in the race's bonuses to
    saving throws.
</p>
<p>
    For this part, like the Base Attack Bonus, we have to do a
    little back-figuring. We find the final values in the race listing.
    For the Solar it is "Saves: Fort +18, ref +18, Will +20". From
    these final numbers we need to subtract the appropriate stat bonus
    (CON for Fortitude, DEX for Reflex, and WIS for Willpower), feat
    bonuses, and epic bonuses.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar's Fortitude Save bonus will be 18 (final)-5 (CON
    mod)-1 (epic bonus)=12. His Reflex Save bonus would be 18 (final)-5
    (DEX mod)-1 (epic bonus)=12. The Willpower Save bonus would be 20
    (final)-7 (WIS mod)-1 (epic bonus)=12.
</p>
<p>
    The tag we use to enter these values is
    <code>BONUS:CHECKS</code>
    . This tag has two forms. The first is
    "
    <code>BONUS:CHECKS|checkname|#</code>
    " which would add "#" as
    bonus that would appear in the "Misc" box on the output sheet. The
    second form (and the one we will use in our race files almost
    always) is "
    <code>BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.checkname|#</code>
    ", which adds
    to the base bonus and makes it appear in the "Base Save" column on
    the output sheets. If the bonus is the same for multiple checks,
    you can do them in one tag by separating them with a comma like
    this
    "
    <code>BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.checkname1,BASE.checkname2|#</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    Our good luck is that all of the Solar's bonuses are the same so
    we can use one tag instead of three. Like the BAB, these values are
    only to be used for default monsters, so we'll use the
    "
    <code>PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    " suffix with it. The tag for the
    Solar would thus be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.Fortitude,BASE.Reflex,BASE.Willpower|12|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey, my concept of him is that he's really
    quick and agile, so we'll give him a +5 for his reflex saves, and a
    +2 to Fortitude and Willpower. Since the bonuses are different we
    need to use two tags. The tags would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.Reflex|5|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
        <br/>
        <code>BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.Fortitude,BASE.Willpower|2|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Ninja Monkey would have Good Reflex and Will saves as a
    Monstrous Humanoid. Therefore in the RSRD it would have base saves
    of Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +4. In LST code this would be:
    <br/>
    <code>BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.Fortitude|1|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    <br/>
    <code>BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.Reflex,BASE.Willpower|4|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>BONUS:STAT</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now we come to the ability scores for the race.
</p>
<p>
    This is complicated a bit by certain rules WotC has
    implemented.  If a race is used as a character the odd scores
    need to be dropped  by one to become even, while the "default
    monster" should have the additional 1 to the stat.
</p>
<p>
    Our first assumption when doing ability scores for races is that
    they will be built on a starting ability  score of 10 in each
    stat. So we need to subtract 10 from each score right off that
    bat.  Then, if the ability  score is odd, subtract one
    more to make it even.  (For the Solar these values would be
    STR 18, DEX 10, CON 10,  INT 12, WIS 14, CHA 14 with INT, WIS
    and CHA being odd). Now that we have the non-monster values, we can
    put  them into the
    <code>BONUS:STAT</code>
    tag.
</p>
<p>
    To designate which stat gets the bonus we use the
    abbreviations.  So for strength it would be
    <code>BONUS:STAT|STR|#</code>
    .   Like the
    <code>BONUS:SKILL</code>
    tag, you can apply the same bonus to more
    than one stat at once by making a comma separated list such as
    <code>BONUS:STAT|STR,CON|#</code>
    .  One last note, if the
    final stat value is 10 then there is no  need to add a bonus
    tag for it.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, to take care of the extra 1 stat point for certain
    stats for default monsters we add one more tag,  lumping
    together all the stats that were odd and adding a
    "
    <code>PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    The PCGen data team is moving away from
    using the "Default Monster" setting.  Default Monster Kits are
    being used instead.
</p>
<p>
    Bearing all the above rules, procedures and gotchas in mind,
    lets put together the stat bonuses for the Solar:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:STAT|STR|18
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|DEX,CON|10
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|INT|12
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|WIS,CHA|14
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|INT,WIS,CHA|1|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey we need to pick stats and then apply the
    same logic to them to code into the .lst file.   I think
    I'll go with final stat values of
    <br/>
    STR:17 DEX:18 CON:14 INT:11 WIS:15 CHA:10.  Our list of bonus
    tags  in the race file would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>BONUS:STAT|STR|6
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|DEX|8
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|CON,WIS|4
            <br/>
            BONUS:STAT|STR,INT,WIS|1|PREDEFAULTMONSTER:Y.</code>
    </p>
