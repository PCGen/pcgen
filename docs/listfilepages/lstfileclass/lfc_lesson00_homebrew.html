<h3>
    Reading Conventions
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    A quick note on a few general conventions used
    within this class before we jump into it:
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    1) Throughout this lesson the angle brackets
    (&lt;&gt;) are used to indicate where your text will be entered
    when building a data file. Unless explicitly stated in the text,
    you will not include the angle brackets in your tags.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    2) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified
    by
    <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
    style.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    3) Files referenced in this lesson are
    identified by
    <span class="lstfile">
    file.lst
   </span>
    style.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    4) When referencing a specific PCGen object,
    i.e. deity, feat, weapon, etc., the object name will be formated as
    <span class="lstobj">
    BOLD
   </span>
    text, except for when the object
    is part of a
    <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
    example.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>
    Data Set Creation Overview
</h3>
<!--    This paragraph has been commented out. Once the LST Editor has been added back to PCGen this paragraph should be uncommented and updated as necessary and the immediate following paragraph should be deleted.
              <p class="indent0">All PCGen data sets are made up of a collection of text files called LST files, each of which contains a particular type of LST Object, e.g. Class,
                      Deity, Feat, Race, etc. PCGen includes built-in LST Editors that can be used to create new LST objects but many LST monkeys find it easier to build data sets from
                      the ground up. For the new LST monkey though, this can be confusing so the PCGen team has provided a basic template for a data set. This template can be found in PCGen's
                      <i>data/&lt;gamemode - 35e or pathfinder&gt;/my_homebrew</i> folder. In this LST Class we will provide an introduction to the <strong>my_homebrew</strong> homebrew data set template and get you
                      started building your own data set, whether it's for your own homebrewed campaign or a simple addition or modification of an existing one to incorporate house rules.</p>

    All PCGen data sets are made up of a collection

    PCGen's
    <i>
        data/&lt;gamemode - 35e or
        pathfinder&gt;/my_homebrew
    </i>
    folder. In this LST Class we will
    provide an introduction to the
    <strong>
        my_homebrew
    </strong>
    data
    set template and get you started building your own data set,
    whether it's for your own homebrewed campaign or a simple addition
    or modification of an existing one to incorporate house rules.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    You will find below a short introduction to the
    data set template itself, followed by a section that will cover
    each of the files which can be found in the data set, covering each
    of the files listed below:
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>
    Introduction to the my_homebrew Files
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_homebrew
   </span>
    template forms a framework for building a dataset for use with
    PCGen. It is meant to be used by beginners who want to take their
    first steps in entering their own custom data into PCGen and have
    found that the built-in List Editors are too limiting. The template
    consists of a collection of LST files, one each for the different
    LST objects possible in PCGen. Copy these files into your own
    folder to make your dataset, leaving the original
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_homebrew
   </span>
    files as a clean template for future
    use. You can rename the copied files to anything you wish but it is
    generally a good idea to use some part of the name for the RPG
    source material you plan on encoding. Also it is a good idea to
    retain the type of LST object contained in the file as part of the
    file names. An example of this might be
    <span class="lstfile">
    rsrd_feat.lst
   </span>
    for the file containing the feats
    for WotC's Revised Standard Reference Document (gamemode 35e). For
    the purposes of this class though we will continue using the
    standard
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_homebrew.lst
   </span>
    naming
    convention. To use this template you will find the LST file
    corresponding to the kind of LST object you wish to create, i.e.
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_classes.lst
   </span>
    if you want to add a
    new class, and enter your new data there. Each LST file includes an
    example to give you a feel for what an entry in that particular
    type of file would look like.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    You will find below more information about each
    LST file, and the LST objects that are defined in them, but you
    will also need to become familiar with PCGen's included
    documentation. You will find this documentation by starting PCGen
    and clicking on "Documentation" in the Help menu. That will bring
    up a browser window in which you will find in the navigation bar on
    the left a link to the 'List Files'. Clicking this link will open a
    menu tree that includes the option 'LST File Tag Index' which
    points to PCGen LST Tag Dictionary. You will also see a 'List File
    Class' links that take you to the same classes linked to below.
    Nnot all LST object types are covered by a LST File Class, but
    those that are covered are covered well. For the rest, you can stop
    by
    <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp/">
        ListFileHelp@Yahoo!
    </a>
    to get help.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Once you have created or editing your LST file
    you will need to edit the
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_campaign.pcc
   </span>
    file. For every one of the LST
    files included, you must set up a line that calls it inside of the
    campaign file, but is commented out by use of a '#' character.
    Remove the '#' from the beginning of the corresponding line. You
    might also want to change the game mode, as it is now set to '35e',
    if your custom data is meant for a different game mode.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    You may also note a file called
    <span class="lstfile">
    OGL.txt
   </span>
    , which we always need to distribute with
    data that is coming from an Open Game Content Source. It is here
    because the examples in the *.lst files were mostly drawn from our
    dataset for the 3.5 System Reference Document. It is not needed for
    your dataset to function.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    If you use this framework to set up a dataset of
    your own, then you may want to rename the folder and files to
    something different. Otherwise if you ever should install a newer
    version of PCGen into your existing directory or needed to
    re-install your existing installation of PCGen, your changes would
    get overwritten and thus be lost.

<h3>
    <a id="pcc" name="pcc">
        The PCGen Campaign Configuration (PCC)
        File
    </a>
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    The PCC file is the most important file in a
    data set as it is the file that PCGen uses to identify what data
    sets are available. Without the PCC file, no data set would be
    loaded, so it is important when building a homebrew data set that
    we start with the PCC file. Beyond identifying the data set as a
    loadable set, the file also provides PCGen with information on the
    campaign itself as well as the specific LST files to be loaded.
</p>
