    The weapon proficiency files are used to set up
    weapon proficiency names and the associated TYPES of weapons that
    they go with.

    There is not that much to them so we'll dive
    right in.

<p>
    Weapon proficiency name
</p>
<p>
    The weapon proficiency file is currently a lst file that has one
    weapon proficiency entry per line. The first thing on each line is
    the name of the weapon proficiency. There is no tag for it, the
    program assumes that whatever is there at the beginning of the line
    is the name of a weapon proficiency.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>TYPE</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The TYPE tag is used to set the type/group of the weapon
    proficiency. This defines for PCGen what type of weapon proficiency
    it takes for characters to be able to use the weapon. It may take
    multiple types delimited by periods, (although this is seldom
    done). The types used are usually Simple, Martial, Exotic or
    Natural (and are defined in the game mode files).
</p>
<p>
    An example would be TYPE:Martial or TYPE.Exotic. If you wanted
    to get more specific you could do TYPE:Martial.Sword.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to note that this is the TYPE line that is
    searched when you use a BONUS:WEAPONPROF=TYPE.yyyy tag. It grants a
    bonus to a weapon whose associated *weaponprof* has the listed
    TYPE.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>HANDS</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The HANDS tag sets the minimum number of hands required to use a
    weapon. This tag is optional. If it is not present, the default
    value assumed by PCGen is 1. While 1 and 2 are the standard
    entries, it would be possible to craft a weapon/weapon proficiency
    for a creature that had three hands and required all three to wield
    it properly.
</p>
<p>
    <code>HANDS:1</code>
    and
    <code>HANDS:2</code>
    are examples of
    the use of this tag.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, there is a flag that you may use in this tag that
    changes it's behavior slightly. That flag is the IFLARGERTHANWEAPON
    flag, described below
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>IFLARGERTHANWEAPON</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is a flag to be used in conjunction with the hands tag. It
    basically acts as a yes/no switch. If you append this to the HANDS
    entry, PCGen will compare the size of the PC to the size of the
    weapon, and grant the proficiency if the pc size is larger than the
    weapon size, otherwise it will not apply.
</p>
<p>
    This is used for certain weapons that are considered to be
    exotic proficiencies if used with one hand, but martial if used
    with both hands. Following is an example of this type of use
    (putting all of the above information together for you as
    well):
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <br/>
        <code>Bastard Sword (Exotic) TYPE:Exotic
            HANDS:1IFLARGERTHANWEAPON
            <br/>
            Bastard Sword (Martial) TYPE:Martial HANDS:2</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    That covers the weaponprof.lst files!
