    The domain file is a simple text file with one
    'Domain' per line. There is only one domain specific tag in PCGen
    so most of the heavy work in building domains is in the global tags
    you will use. In this class I will go over both the domain specific
    tag as well as a few of the global tags, organized into two
    lessons: The Basics, Lesson 15, covering the tags required to
    create the basic functionality of a domain, and The Domain Powers,
    Lesson 16, that will cover the more advanced tags that will be used
    to add the 'Domain Powers' to your domains. Unfortunately, there
    are so many variations of global tags that can be used in any data
    file, including the domain file, that it is impractical to go over
    them all, but I believe that the examples I will be using in these
    two lessons, in conjunction with the PCGen documentation, will give
    you a jump start on building your own domains.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    For those of you that have gone through the
    previous LST Classes, some of the global tags will be repetitive.
    feel free to skip those portions if you like. These classes are
    being written for the new LST-coder, so there will be some overlap,
    but a student of the classes does not need to take them in
    order.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    To help you better understand how to put this
    file together, I will be using several domains as examples, three
    drawn from the Revised Standard Reference Document (RSRD) and one I
    have made up for this class in order to more completely demonstrate
    a few specific global tags. The domains we'll look at from the RSRD
    are
    <em>
        <strong>
            Law
        </strong>
    </em>
    ,
    <em>
        <strong>
            Trickery
        </strong>
    </em>
    and
    <em>
        <strong>
            War
        </strong>
    </em>
    , as well as the new domain of
    'Poetry'. Our new domain is presented below in the standard RSRD
    format so you can follow along.

    The Poetry Domain is a little overdone, but I
    wanted to demonstrate a number of global tags. I would not
    recommend using the Poetry Domain in your campaign, unless of
    course you believe the pen is mightier than the sword . . .
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent0">
    Without further adieu, lets jump right into the
    lesson.
</p>
<p class="sidebar1">
    NOTE: The general conventions used within this
    class can be found on the
    <a href="lfc_style_guide.html">
        LST File
        Class Style Guide
    </a>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent0">
    <code><strong>
        &lt;Domain
        Name&gt;
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This is the name used for the domain. There is
    no specific tag associated with this entry and it must be the first
    entry on the domain line. So, our example domains lines will begin
    simply enough with the following entries:
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>War</code>
    &lt;tab&gt;
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Poetry</code>
    &lt;tab&gt;
</p>
<p class="indent0">
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent0">
    <code><strong>
        DESC
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Now we are getting to the 'fun stuff'. This tag
    is a global tag and is used to provide a simple explanation, or as
    Professor Baraks calls it, the 'flavor text', of the powers granted
    to the cleric by the domain. These powers can range anywhere from
    granted feats, spell-like abilities, or enhancements to any number
    of skills and abilities. If you are creating a domain based upon
    your favorite source book, you can generally find this information
    identified as the 'Granted Powers' in the domain block. For the
    Poetry Domain listed above and the War Domain, found in the RSRD,
    the
    <code>DESC</code>
    tags are reproduced below:
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<blockquote class="indent2">
    <p class="tagindent2">
        <code>War</code>
    </p>
    <p class="tagindent2">
        <code>DESC:Free Martial Weapon Proficiency
            with deity’s favored weapon (if necessary) and Weapon Focus
            with the deity favored weapon.</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent0">
</p>
<blockquote class="indent2">
    <p class="tagindent2">
        <code>Poetry</code>
    </p>
    <p class="tagindent2">
        <code>DESC:You add all Perform skills to your
            cleric class skills and automatically gain the ability to Scribe
            Scrolls at 3rd level. You cast mind-affecting spells at +1 caster
            level. and is graced by Great Intelligence every four levels to a
            maximum of 20th level. If you have a charisma score of 12 or
            greater you may use Ventriloquism once a day as a spell-like
            ability.</code>

<p class="indent0">
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="indent0">
    <code><strong>
        SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    In the domain file this tag provides a list of
    bonus spells, and their levels, that the cleric is granted access
    to by the domain.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    There are two types of argument regularly used
    with this tag, used in pairs in a pipe (|) delimited list. These
    arguments are the domain spell level slot, appearing as
    <code>&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell level&gt;</code>
    , and the name
    of the spell that fills that level slot. Together, the string of
    arguments will look like this:
    <code>|&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell
        level 1&gt;|&lt;spell name 1&gt;|&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell
        level 2&gt;|&lt;spell name 2&gt;|&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell
        level 3&gt;|&lt;spell name 3&gt; . . .</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Using this format, and looking at the spell list
    for the War domain, we would code the first level War domain spell
    this way: &lt;War=1|Magic Weapon&gt;, with the complete list of
    spells codded as seen in the complete example below.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Looking at our sample domain as defined above,
    the second example below shows how we would code the domain spells
    for the domain of Poetry.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Oh, and one more thing. When listing a spell you
    MUST use the name used at the beginning of its entry in the
    spell.lst file and NOT its output name. The Poetry domains 3rd
    level spell,
    <em>
        <strong>
            Geas, Lesser
        </strong>
    </em>
    is a good
    example. The rsrd_spells.lst file has 'Geas (Lesser)' as the name
    of the spell with its output name being
    <em>
        <strong>
            Geas,
            Lesser
        </strong>
    </em>
    . Other incarnations of the
    <code>SPELLLEVEL</code>
    tag use comma-delimited data and including
    a comma in the domain's spell list will cause PCGen to ignore the
    spell reference, thereby not granting access to that spell as a
    domain spell.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="tagindent1">
        <code>War</code>
        &lt;tab&gt; . . .
        &lt;tab&gt;

<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag is as simple as it looks. It identifies
    the page within the source material where you can find the specific
    description, powers, and spells for the domain you are creating. It
    takes free-form text but most often you will find it in one of two
    forms. If your source material is an OGL book the format is usually
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:p.&lt;#&gt;</code>
    . If you are working from an
    online source, such as the RSRD, you would use the filename, so
    your tag would look like
    <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;filename&gt;.</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Since I have created the Poetry Domain from
    scratch there is no 'source', so there is no
    <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
    tag required, but many functions and
    filters in PCGen use it, so it is good to include it. Therefore, I
    will include the tag with an N/A for the source page.
    The War Domain on the other hand comes from the RSRD and
    therefore would use the
    <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
    tag per the example
    below.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Note: There are three other
    <code>SOURCExxx</code>
    tags (
    <code>SOURCELONG</code>
    ,
    <code>SOURCESHORT</code>
    and
    <code>SOURCEWEB</code>
    ) that will be
    covered in a separate class so we will not be covering them
    here.

    Well, that's everything you need to add new
    domains to your campaign, albeit, only the most basic of
    functionality will exist. You may have noted a number of abilities
    are included in the
    <code>DESC</code>
    tag that this domain entry
    doesn't implement. To see how to implement these abilities we will
