   The domain file is a simple text file with one
'Domain' per line. There is only one domain specific tag in PCGen
so most of the heavy work in building domains is in the global tags
you will use. In this class I will go over both the domain specific
tag as well as a few of the global tags, organized into two
lessons: The Basics, Lesson 15, covering the tags required to
create the basic functionality of a domain, and The Domain Powers,
Lesson 16, that will cover the more advanced tags that will be used
to add the 'Domain Powers' to your domains. Unfortunately, there
are so many variations of global tags that can be used in any data
file, including the domain file, that it is impractical to go over
them all, but I believe that the examples I will be using in these
two lessons, in conjunction with the PCGen documentation, will give
you a jump start on building your own domains.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   For those of you that have gone through the
previous LST Classes, some of the global tags will be repetitive.
feel free to skip those portions if you like. These classes are
being written for the new LST-coder, so there will be some overlap,
but a student of the classes does not need to take them in
order.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   To help you better understand how to put this
file together, I will be using several domains as examples, three
drawn from the Revised Standard Reference Document (RSRD) and one I
have made up for this class in order to more completely demonstrate
a few specific global tags. The domains we'll look at from the RSRD
are
   <em>
    <strong>
     Law
    </strong>
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    <strong>
     Trickery
    </strong>
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    <strong>
     War
    </strong>
   </em>
   , as well as the new domain of
'Poetry'. Our new domain is presented below in the standard RSRD
format so you can follow along.
  </p>
  <h3>

   The Poetry Domain is a little overdone, but I
wanted to demonstrate a number of global tags. I would not
recommend using the Poetry Domain in your campaign, unless of
course you believe the pen is mightier than the sword . . .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent0">
   Without further adieu, lets jump right into the
lesson.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   NOTE: The general conventions used within this
class can be found on the
   <a href="lfc_style_guide.html">

  <p class="indent0">
   <code><strong>
     &lt;Domain
Name&gt;
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   This is the name used for the domain. There is
no specific tag associated with this entry and it must be the first
entry on the domain line. So, our example domains lines will begin
simply enough with the following entries:
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    Example:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>War</code>
   &lt;tab&gt;
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>Poetry</code>
   &lt;tab&gt;
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent0">
   <code><strong>
     DESC
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Now we are getting to the 'fun stuff'. This tag
is a global tag and is used to provide a simple explanation, or as
Professor Baraks calls it, the 'flavor text', of the powers granted
to the cleric by the domain. These powers can range anywhere from
granted feats, spell-like abilities, or enhancements to any number
of skills and abilities. If you are creating a domain based upon
your favorite source book, you can generally find this information
identified as the 'Granted Powers' in the domain block. For the
Poetry Domain listed above and the War Domain, found in the RSRD,
the
   <code>DESC</code>
   tags are reproduced below:
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    Example:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <blockquote class="indent2">
   <p class="tagindent2">
    <code>War</code>
   </p>
   <p class="tagindent2">
    <code>DESC:Free Martial Weapon Proficiency
with deity’s favored weapon (if necessary) and Weapon Focus
with the deity favored weapon.</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent0">
  </p>
  <blockquote class="indent2">
   <p class="tagindent2">
    <code>Poetry</code>
   </p>
   <p class="tagindent2">
    <code>DESC:You add all Perform skills to your
cleric class skills and automatically gain the ability to Scribe
Scrolls at 3rd level. You cast mind-affecting spells at +1 caster
level. and is graced by Great Intelligence every four levels to a
maximum of 20th level. If you have a charisma score of 12 or

ability.</code>

  <p class="indent0">
   <code><strong>
     SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   In the domain file this tag provides a list of
bonus spells, and their levels, that the cleric is granted access
to by the domain.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   There are two types of argument regularly used
with this tag, used in pairs in a pipe (|) delimited list. These
arguments are the domain spell level slot, appearing as
   <code>&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell level&gt;</code>
   , and the name
of the spell that fills that level slot. Together, the string of
arguments will look like this:
   <code>|&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell
level 1&gt;|&lt;spell name 1&gt;|&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell
level 2&gt;|&lt;spell name 2&gt;|&lt;domain name&gt;=&lt;spell
level 3&gt;|&lt;spell name 3&gt; . . .</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Using this format, and looking at the spell list
for the War domain, we would code the first level War domain spell
this way: &lt;War=1|Magic Weapon&gt;, with the complete list of
spells codded as seen in the complete example below.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Looking at our sample domain as defined above,
the second example below shows how we would code the domain spells
for the domain of Poetry.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Oh, and one more thing. When listing a spell you
MUST use the name used at the beginning of its entry in the
spell.lst file and NOT its output name. The Poetry domains 3rd
level spell,
   <em>
    <strong>
     Geas, Lesser
    </strong>
   </em>
   is a good
example. The rsrd_spells.lst file has 'Geas (Lesser)' as the name
of the spell with its output name being
   <em>
    <strong>
     Geas,
Lesser
    </strong>
   </em>
   . Other incarnations of the
   <code>SPELLLEVEL</code>
   tag use comma-delimited data and including
a comma in the domain's spell list will cause PCGen to ignore the
spell reference, thereby not granting access to that spell as a
domain spell.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    Example:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>War</code>
    &lt;tab&gt; . . .
&lt;tab&gt;
    <code>SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN|War=1|Magic
Weapon|War=2|Spiritual Weapon|War=3|Magic Vestment|War=4|Divine
Power|War=5|Flame Strike|War=6|Blade Barrier|War=7|Power Word
Blind|War=8|Power Word Stun|War=9|Power Word Kill</code>
   </p>
   <p class="tagindent1">
    <code>Poetry</code>
    &lt;tab&gt; . . .
&lt;tab&gt;
    <code>SPELLLEVEL:DOMAIN|Poetry=1|Hypnotism|Poetry=2|Suggestion|Poetry=3|Geas
(Lesser)|Poetry=4|Modify Memory|Poetry=5|Song of
Discord|Poetry=6|Irresistible Dance|Poetry=7|Hold Person

(Mass)</code>

  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   This tag is as simple as it looks. It identifies
the page within the source material where you can find the specific
description, powers, and spells for the domain you are creating. It
takes free-form text but most often you will find it in one of two
forms. If your source material is an OGL book the format is usually
   <code>SOURCEPAGE:p.&lt;#&gt;</code>
   . If you are working from an
online source, such as the RSRD, you would use the filename, so
your tag would look like
   <code>SOURCEPAGE:&lt;filename&gt;.</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Since I have created the Poetry Domain from
scratch there is no 'source', so there is no
   <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
   tag required, but many functions and
filters in PCGen use it, so it is good to include it. Therefore, I
will include the tag with an N/A for the source page.
The War Domain on the other hand comes from the RSRD and
therefore would use the
   <code>SOURCEPAGE</code>
   tag per the example
below.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Note: There are three other
   <code>SOURCExxx</code>
   tags (
   <code>SOURCELONG</code>
   ,
   <code>SOURCESHORT</code>
   and
   <code>SOURCEWEB</code>
   ) that will be
covered in a separate class so we will not be covering them
here.

   Well, that's everything you need to add new
domains to your campaign, albeit, only the most basic of
functionality will exist. You may have noted a number of abilities
are included in the
   <code>DESC</code>

doesn't implement. To see how to implement these abilities we will
