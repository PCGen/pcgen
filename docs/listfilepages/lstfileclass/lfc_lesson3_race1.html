One will be from the System   Reference Document (SRD) so you can see how&nbsp; to do an already existing race and the other   I'm going to make up on the fly and use to demonstrate every tag I can remember.&nbsp;   :p</p><p>One thing to note is that these will be considered &quot;monster&quot; races.   Towards the end of the lesson i'll go back through and create a player   character only race.</p><p>We'll do a Solar and, ummm, I know!&nbsp; Ninja Monkeys!&nbsp; :)  The lessons willfollow the format of a standard monster write up. A sample monster write up for our Ninja Monkeyrace is presented below so you can follow along (in RSRD format)</p><hr/><table border="0" cols="2" width="75%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr colspan="2"><strong>Ninja Monkey</strong></tr><tr colspan="2">Medium Monstrous Humanoid</tr><tr valign="top"><td width="30%" align="left"><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td align="left">4d8+8 (26 hp)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="30%"><strong>Initiative:</strong></td><td>+8</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="30%"><strong>Speed:</strong></td><td>30 ft.

You can find a number of these  syntax files on the Yahoo! Group <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental">PCGen_experimental</a>.</p><p>I'll use &quot;mystuff_races.lst&quot; as the file name.&nbsp; This conforms   to the the new naming convention adopted by the&nbsp; PCGen lstmonkey crew recently.   Basically it is in the format of &quot;source_filetype.lst&quot;.</p>  <p class="sidebar"><strong>Update to RSRD</strong><br/>  These classes were originally written using the SRD (3.0 rules).  Throughout you will  find sidebars like this one with notes on the differences between the 3.0 rule set and the   3.5 rule set as found in the Revised System Reference Document (RSRD).  </p><hr><p>Race Name</p><p>The race file is currently a lst file that has one racial entry per line.&nbsp;   The first thing on each line is&nbsp; the race name.&nbsp; There is no tag for   it, the program assumes that whatever is there is the name of a race.</p><p>One thing to consider when entering the race name is grouping (all demons together,   etc).&nbsp; A Solar is a&nbsp; celestial, and we'd like it to show up with other   celestials, so the name I'm going to enter will be &quot;Celestial (Solar)&quot;.&nbsp;   On the next Line I'll enter &quot;Ninja Monkey&quot;.&nbsp;</p>  <p class="sidebar"><strong>Update to RSRD</strong><br/>  In the RSRD the Solar is listed as an Angel not a Celestial.  Therefore we would name  it &quot;Angel (Solar)&quot;.  </p><hr><p><strong><code>OUTPUTNAME</code></strong></p><p>Now, &quot;Celestial (Solar)&quot;, while making it easy to find in the race   list with the other celestials will look&nbsp; kind of funny on output, so we'll   use the OUTPUTNAME tag to change what will appear on output (if the user has   the preference checked to use it).</p><p>The OUTPUTNAME tag can be used in a couple of different manners.&nbsp; You   can completely change the name of an&nbsp; object (as far as output is concerned)   and not reference the real name at all, or you can use part of the real&nbsp;   name.&nbsp; A special string was developed to grant access to only the text   contained in parentheses.&nbsp; That string is&nbsp; &quot;[NAME]&quot; (no   quotes).</p><p>So, if we wanted the name on output to be &quot;Celestial, Solar&quot;, we   could do it two different ways. 1) OUTPUTNAME:Celestial, Solar or 2) OUTPUTNAME:Celestial,   [NAME].&nbsp; I don't like either one of those...&nbsp; I&nbsp; just want it   to be called a &quot;Solar&quot; on output, so I'm entering the tag like this:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>OUTPUTNAME:[NAME]</code></p></blockquote><p>The name &quot;Ninja Monkey&quot; is just fine as it is, so we'll skip an OUTPUTNAME   tag on this one.</p><hr>	<p><code><strong>SIZE</strong></code></p><p>Every creature has a size.&nbsp; The size tag uses the first letter of each   size category, so the possible choices&nbsp; are F (Fine), D (Dimunitive), T   (Tiny), S (Small), M (Medium), L (Large), H (Huge), G (Gargantuan), and C&nbsp;   (Colossal).</p><p>The Solar is a Large creature so on that line we'll enter a couple tabs and   then put &quot;<code>SIZE:L</code>&quot;.&nbsp; The Ninja&nbsp; Monkey is man-sized   (Medium), so we'll put &quot;<code>SIZE:M</code>&quot; on that line.</p><hr><p><code><strong>RACETYPE/RACESUBTYPE</strong></code></p><p>After the creature's size the next information is the race type.  For the Solar itis listed as Outsider (Good).&nbsp; The information in the brackets after the typelists all the subtypes for the monster, in this case Good.&nbsp; We will enter &quot;<code>RACETYPE:Outsider</code>&quot; put in a tab and enter &quot;<code>RACESUBTYPE:Good</code>&quot;.</p><p>For the Ninja Monkey we have to enter just the type with no subtypes.</p><blockquote>  <p><code>RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid</code></p></blockquote><p class="sidebar"><strong>Update to RSRD</strong><br/>The Solar changes subtypes in the RSRD to Outsider (Angel, Extraplanar, Good). Thefore weneed to change our subtype entry to read <code>RACESUBTYPE:Angel|Extraplanar|Good</code>.</p><hr/><p><code><strong>TYPE</strong></code></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This use of TYPE has been deprecated and is replaced with <code>RACETYPE/RACESUBTYPE</code>.</p><p>We use the TYPE tag to indicate what type of creature the race is (Aberration,   Undead, Animal, Monstrous Humanoid, Magical Beast, etc.).</p><p>The Solar is an Outsider so our tag would read &quot;<code>TYPE:Outsider</code>&quot;.</p><p>The Ninja monkey is a Monstrous Humanoid so our tag would be &quot;<code>TYPE:Monstrous   Humanoid</code>&quot;.</p><hr><p><code><strong>MONSTERCLASS</strong></code></p><p>The MONSTERCLASS tag is used by the program when the &quot;Default Monster&quot;   setting is off. It tells it how many and which monster class levels to give   the race (as opposed to using the HITDICE tag when in &quot;Default Monster&quot;   mode).</p><p>The tag takes the format of MONSTERCLASS:&lt;monsterclassname&gt;:&lt;levels&gt;.   For PCGen distribution files the class name is *usually* the type of creature   and the number of levels is usually set equal to the number of HD the default   creature has. An exception to this is when the racial description says they   are spellcasters... &quot;cast as 18th level sorcerers&quot;. In that case we   create a special class (in a class.lst file) to grant the race the appropriate   spellcasting levels.</p><p>The Solar is an Outsider with 22 HD, and he casts spells as a 20th level cleric,   so his tag would be &quot;<code>MONSTERCLASS:Solar:22</code>&quot;</p><p>For the Ninja Monkey, he's a Monstrous Humanoid and has 4 HD and no spellcasting   ability, so the tag for him would read &quot;<code>MONSTERCLASS:Monstrous Humanoid:4</code>&quot;.</p><hr><p><code><strong>HITDICE</strong></code></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The PCGen data team is moving away from using the &quot;Default Monster&quot;setting.&nbsp; Default Monster Kits are being used instead.</p><p>This is the tag we use to indicate the die size and quantity of hit dice a   race gets. The program uses this when the &quot;Default Monster&quot; setting   in the preferences is on. It takes the format of HITDICE:&lt;quantity&gt;,&lt;size&gt;.   This information is found at the top of each race listing.</p><p>The Solar has 22d8 hit points, so would have &quot;<code>HITDICE:22,8</code>&quot;   for this tag.</p><p>The ninja monkey has 4d8 hit points, so would have &quot;<code>HITDICE:4,8</code>&quot;   for this tag.</p><hr><p><strong><code>MOVE</code></strong></p><p>To define a race's movement modes and rates we use the MOVE tag.&nbsp; The   format is &quot;MOVE:mode,rate,mode,rate&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can enter as   many movement modes and rates as you want.</p><p>Looking at the Solar in the SRD, they list &quot;SPEED:50ft,fly 150ft&quot;.&nbsp;   The first number is always their &quot;Walk&quot;&nbsp; (otherwise known as   &quot;Base&quot;) movement rate, except for those races that can't walk like   some plants. So on&nbsp; the Solar's line we will enter (remember to put a tab   or two between the last tag and this new one):</p><blockquote>  <p><code>MOVE:Walk,50,Fly,150</code></p></blockquote><p>I'm going to give the Ninja Monkey a walk rate of 30 and a climb rate of 20,   so the&nbsp; tag for his line would be:</p><blockquote>  <p><code>MOVE:Walk,30,Climb,20</code></p></blockquote><hr><p>I'm going to end this lesson at this point.&nbsp; If you have questions, please   post them to the Yahoo! group <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp">PCGenListFileHelp</a>.</p><p>The example file for this lesson can be found at the <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/LSTfileclass/">LSTfileclass   Yahoo Group</a> in the files section <a href="http://f2.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/EKxcQRSQkNqrtFjDTDyZ5ZvY6XxwOMY5DToAK4c8KwnppEP1vNZ7czz_HnUk-vVPAEAIj4d1fL_uy8smyJGnXeTZ1TeVuQ/Lesson%20Files/mystuff_races.lst">here</a>.</p><p>Barak<br>  LST Chimp</p><p>  <!-- <p class="cvsfooter">$Source: /cvsroot/pcgendocs/pcgendocs/docs/listfilepages/lstfileclass/lfc_lesson3_race1.html,v $ ($Revision: 1.3 $) last updated $Date: 2006/02/23 02:34:06 $ by $Author: boomer70 $</p> --></p></body></html>
