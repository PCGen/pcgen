    This is a continuation of the material presented in
    <a href="lfc_lesson15_domains1.html">
        LST File Class #15, Domain Basics
    </a>
    .
    In this lesson I will go over a handful of global tags needed to
    implement the domain powers as described in our sample domains. As
    with the previous lesson on domains, I will be using several
    domains as examples. Four drawn from the Revised Standard Reference
    Document (R/SRD) and one I have made up for this class in order to
    more completely demonstrate a few specific global tags. The domains
    we'll look from the RSRD are
    <em>
        <strong>
            Animal
        </strong>
    </em>
    ,
    <em>
        <strong>
            Law
        </strong>
    </em>
    ,
    <em>
        <strong>
            Trickery
        </strong>
    </em>
    and
    <em>
        <strong>
            War
        </strong>
    </em>
    , as well as the new domain of
    'Poetry'. Our new domain is presented below in the standard RSRD
    format so you can follow along.

<p>
    <strong>
        NOTE:
    </strong>
    The Poetry Domain is a little overdone,
    but I wanted to demonstrate a number of global tags. I would not
    recommend using the Poetry Domain in your campaign, unless of
    course you believe the pen is mightier than the sword . . .
</p>
<h3>
    Granted Powers
</h3>
<p>
    Before we begin we must first identify which 'Granted Powers'
    need to be implemented. Our source for these powers is the text
    following the
    <code>DESC</code>
    tag. Looking at the Poetry domain
    listed above, we get the following powers:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Add all
        <em>
            <strong>
                <strong>
                    <em>
                        Perform
                    </em>
                </strong>
            </strong>
        </em>
        skills
        to your cleric class skills.
        <br/>
        You may automatically
        <strong>
            <em>
                Scribe Scrolls
            </em>
        </strong>
        at
        3rd level.
        <br/>
        You cast mind-affecting spells at +1 caster level.
        <br/>
        Graced by
        <em>
            <strong>
                Great Intelligence
            </strong>
        </em>
        every four
        levels to a maximum of 20th level.
        <br/>
        May use
        <strong>
            Ventriloquism
        </strong>
        once a day as a spell-like
        ability (If you have a charisma score of 12 or greater)
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    Without further adieu, lets jump right into the lesson.
</p>
<p class="sidebar1">
    NOTE: The general conventions used within this
    class can be found on the
    <a href="lfc_style_guide.html">
        LST File
        Class Style Guide
    </a>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        CSKILL
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    This tag is used to add skills to the cleric's list of class
    skills. The new class skills may include a single skill or may be a
    pipe (|) delimited list of skills to be added. An example of this
    is the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Trickery
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain which adds the
    three skills of
    <em>
        <strong>
            Bluff
        </strong>
    </em>
    ,
    <em>
        <strong>
            Disguise
        </strong>
    </em>
    , and
    <em>
        <strong>
            Hide
        </strong>
    </em>
    to the Cleric's list of class
    skills. The first example below gives the form of this tag.
</p>
<p>
    The skills being added may also be designated by
    <code>TYPE</code>
    , taking the form of
    <code>TYPE.&lt;skill
        type&gt;</code>
    . Our new domain is a good example of this as the
    domain adds all
    <em>
        <strong>
            Perform
        </strong>
    </em>
    type skills to
    the Cleric's class skills list. See the example below to see the
    tag in action.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Trickery &lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;
        CSKILL:Bluff|Disguise|Hide</code>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Poetry &lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;
        CSKILL:TYPE.Perform</code>
</p>

<p>
    <code><strong>
        BONUS:CASTERLEVEL
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    This tag grants a bonus to the character's caster level. This
    bonus is dependent upon specific qualifying parameters, which are
    identified within the tag itself. The tag only requires two
    arguments, the qualifying tag and the number of levels the caster
    level is increased, with a third optional argument in the form of a
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag. The general form this tag and its argument
    take as follows:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|&lt;qualifying
        tag&gt;|&lt;level bonus&gt;|PRExxx</code>
</p>
<p>
    There are several different types of qualifying tags, including
    the class name, a spell
    <code>DESCRIPTOR</code>
    , a
    <code>DOMAIN</code>
    , a
    <code>RACE</code>
    , a
    <code>SCHOOL</code>
    , a
    <code>SPELL</code>
    , a
    <code>SUBSCHOOL</code>
    , and a
    <code>TYPE</code>
    . Each of these tags, except for the class name,
    take the form of
    <code>&lt;TAG&gt;.text</code>
    , with the text being
    appropriate for the tag, i.e.
    <code>RACE.Elf%</code>
    ,
    <code>SCHOOL.Abjuration</code>
    ,
    <code>TYPE.Arcane</code>
    , etc. The
    class name is a simple text entry giving the name of the
    appropriate class, i.e.
    <code>Cleric</code>
    . Looking at the Domain
    of Law in the RSRD, the
    <em>
        rsrd_domains.lst
    </em>
    file, we find,
    that a divine spell caster with this domain receives a bonus when
    casting lawful based spells. The specific spell descriptor of
    'Lawful' is used in this tag taking the form:
    <code>DESCRIPTOR.Lawful</code>
    . Examining the list of granted
    powers for the Domain of
    <code>Poetry</code>
    above, we see a divine
    spell caster with this domain receives a bonus when casting
    'Mind-Affecting' spells. The qualifying tag for the bonus takes the
    following form:
    <code>DESCRIPTOR.Mind-Affecting</code>
    .
</p>
<p>
    The second argument in our tag is the level bonus. This is a
    number, variable, or formula that represent the number of levels
    that is added to the divine casters level for the purposes of
    determining the effects, DC, etc. In both the domain of
    <em>
        <strong>
            Law
        </strong>
    </em>
    and the domain of
    <em>
        <strong>
            Poetry
        </strong>
    </em>
    , the bonus level is '1'.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, this tag can take
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tags, with the
    most common tag being the
    <code>PRERULE</code>
    tag which checks the
    state of rule as set in PCGen's 'House Rule' preferences. The rule
    must be defined in the
    <em>
        <strong>
            rules.lst
        </strong>
    </em>
    file in
    the 'system/gameModes' folder within PCGen. The particular rule we
    are interested in for the BONUS:
    <code>CASTERLEVEL</code>
    tag
    applies Casterlevel Bonuses from Domains to all Spells and is
    referenced by the
    <code>VAR:SYS_DOMAIN</code>
    tag, as defined in
    the
    <em>
        <strong>
            rules.lst
        </strong>
    </em>
    file.
</p>
<p>
    Taking all of this together, the
    <code>BONUS:CASTERLEVEL</code>
    tag for our two sample domains take the form shown below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Law &lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;
        BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|DESCRIPTOR.Lawful|1|PRERULE:SYS_DOMAIN</code>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Poetry &lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;
        BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|DESCRIPTOR.Mind-Affecting|1|PRERULE:SYS_DOMAIN</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        PREALIGN
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        PRExxx
    </strong>
    tags are global tags that apply
    specific prerequisites to the character before granting the
    selected domain and its granted powers and spells. You may include
    as many of these tags as you like and each of them will be applied
    to the domain as a whole. If the character does not meet ALL
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tags, the domain cannot be selected.
    Unfortunately, there are too many
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tags to go
    over in this class so I will restrict my coverage to the most
    likely tag. That is the
    <code>PREALIGN</code>
    tag.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <code>PREALIGN</code>
    tag applies an alignment requirement
    to the cleric. The form this tag takes is:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>PREALIGN:&lt;alignment
        list&gt;</code>
    .
</p>
<p>
    The alignment list is a comma-delimited list of alignment
    abbreviations as follows: Lawful Good=
    <code>NG</code>
    , Lawful
    Neutral=
    <code>LN</code>
    , Lawful Evil=
    <code>LE</code>
    , Neutral
    Good=
    <code>NG</code>
    , True Neutral=
    <code>TN</code>
    , Neutral
    Evil=
    <code>NE</code>
    , Chaotic Good=
    <code>CG</code>
    , Chaotic
    Neutral=
    <code>CN</code>
    , and Chaotic Evil=
    <code>CE</code>
    . An
    additional identifier is
    <code>Deity</code>
    , representing the
    alignment of the characters deity.
</p>
<p>
    Note: The alignments have been assigned specific numbers, which
    can also be used. The numbers are: 0=LG, 1=LN, 2=LE, 3=NG, 4=TN,
    5=NE, 6=CG, 7=CN, 8=CE, and 10=Deities alignment. These values can
    be used instead of the abbreviations
</p>
<p>
    An example of this usage can be seen below for the domain of
    Law. As there are no restrictions to be applied, either for
    alignment or by any other cr criteria, for the domain of
    <em>
        <strong>
            Poetry
        </strong>
    </em>
    , we will not be including a
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag in our
    <em>
        <strong>
            Poetry
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain line.
</p>
<p>
    As a final note, this tag provides prerequisites that are
    separate from the prerequisites used in conjunction with the
    <a href="../datafilestagpages/datafilesdeities.html#domains">
        <code>DOMAINS</code>
    </a>
    tag.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Law &lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;
        PREALIGN:LG,LN,LE</code>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        SPELLS
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    This tag grants the cleric spell-like abilities. This tag has a
    number of arguments that we will explain below but first, the
    general form of this tag and its many arguments are as follows:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>SPELLS:&lt;spellbook&gt;|TIMES=&lt;number
        or formula&gt;|CASTERLEVEL=&lt;number
        <br/>
        of formula&gt;|&lt;spell name&gt;,&lt;spell DC&gt;|&lt;PRExxx
        tag&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
    The first argument in the
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag is the name of
    the spellbook that the spell-like ability will be displayed in
    within PCGen and on the character sheet. This may include any name
    you can imagine, though the several examples of this tag in the
    RSRD use either 'Innate' or the name of the domain granting the
    ability as can be seen in the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Animal
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain example given below. It is very important though that the
    spellbook name NOT be the same as any Class names, i.e. 'Cleric',
    'Sorcerer', etc. Using an existing class name will cause PCGen to
    throw an exception and it will not function properly. For our
    purposes, the spell book entered is the domain name and takes the
    form of
    <code>&lt;domain name&gt; Domain</code>
    . For the poetry
    domain we would enter
    <code>Poetry Domain</code>
    .
</p>
<p>
    The
    <code>TIMES</code>
    tag is an optional tag that identifies
    the number of times a day the spell-like ability may be used. If
    it's not included in the domain line, PCGen will default to 1 time
    per day. You may enter a specific value, a variable, or a formula
    in this tag. It is important to note that within the domain file
    the
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag is not associated with any specific
    class, therefore, the variable
    <code>CL</code>
    will not work. (For
    more information about formulas within PCGen, see the
    <a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesformulas.html">
        Math Operators and Formulas
    </a>
    section in the PCGen
    Documentation.) A special value that may be entered is the value
    '-1', which will cause an output on the character sheet of 'At
    Will'. Both the Animal and Poetry domains grant spell-like
    abilities that are usable once per day so both domain entries will
    include the
    <code>TIMES=1</code>
    tag.
</p>
<p>
    <code>CASTERLEVEL</code>
    is an optional tag that sets the level
    at which the spell-like ability is cast. As with the
    <code>TIMES</code>
    tag, you may enter any value, variable, or
    formula as desired. If it is not included, PCGen will default to 1.
    Only one
    <code>CASTERLEVEL</code>
    tag is allowed in each
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag entry. For the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Animal
        </strong>
    </em>
    and
    <em>
        <strong>
            Poetry
        </strong>
    </em>
    domains, we base the caster level
    on the total level of the character, including the PC, NPC, and
    Monster levels but not including any level adjustments, so we will
    be using the
    <code>TL</code>
    variable as the basis for the caster
    level. Unfortunately, there may be circumstances where the total
    level is reduced to zero or below, i.e. with the application of a
    template that applies negative levels. In this case, we still want
    the spell-like ability to function, even if at a minimum level.
    Therefore, we will use the
    <code>max()</code>
    formula tag. The
    entry for the casterlevel for both of our example domains becomes
    <code>CASTERLEVEL=max(TL,1)</code>
    , setting the caster level of the
    spell-like ability to the character's total level with a minimum
    level of 1.
</p>
<p>
    Besides the spell book, the
    <code>&lt;spell name&gt;</code>
    is
    the only other mandatory argument for the
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag
    as it provides, as the tag implies, the name of the spell being
    granted as a spell-like ability. This spell must exist in the
    loaded datasets and must appear exactly as it does in the first
    position on the spell line in the spell file. The optional
    <code>&lt;spell DC&gt;</code>
    value may be a number, variable, or
    formula. I will establish the DC for the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Poetry
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain as
    <code>12+WIS</code>
    ,
    meaning a base score of twelve (12) plus the wisdom modifier. The
    RSRD gives the DC value for the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Animal
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain as
    <code>11+WIS</code>
    , being a base score of eleven (11)
    plus the wisdom modifier.
</p>
<p>
    The last argument to discuss is the global
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag. These are used to set prerequisites for the spell-like ability
    such as alignment requirements or minimum stat requirements. If a
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag requires multiple
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    statements they are included as a pipe (|) delimited list at the
    end of the
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag. Some of the
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    statements have pipe (|) delimiting in them, in which case you
    simply put that
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    statement in a separate
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag by itself. The
    <em>
        <strong>
            Speak with
            Animals
        </strong>
    </em>
    ability granted by the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Animal
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain does not carry a
    prerequisite so you will not find a
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag
    attached to the
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag. The
    <em>
        <strong>
            Poetry
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain, on the other hand, does
    require a minimum wisdom before the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Ventriloquism
        </strong>
    </em>
    ability is granted. This
    prerequisite is coded using the
    <code>PRESTAT</code>
    tag which
    takes two arguments; 1) the number of stats which must qualify, one
    in our case, and 2) the stat and its value, identified by the stat
    abbreviation defined in the
    <em>
        <strong>
            statsandchecks.lst
        </strong>
    </em>
    file and a numeric
    value representing the minimum stat value. Our
    <code>PRESTAT</code>
    tag takes this form:
    <code>PRESTAT:1,WIS=12</code>
</p>
<p>
    Ok, so we've gone over all the arguments allowed in the
    <code>SPELLS</code>
    tag. The only thing left to do is put them al
    together so we can see the final tag, and this we have done
    below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Animal &lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;
        <br/>
        SPELLS:Animal Domain|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=max(TL,1)|Speak with
        Animals,11+WIS</code>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Poetry &lt;tab&gt; . . . &lt;tab&gt;
        <br/>
        SPELLS:Poetry
        Domain|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=max(TL,1)|Ventriloquism,12+WIS|PRESTAT:1,WIS=12</code>
</p>

<h3>
    <code><strong>
        VFEAT
    </strong></code>
</h3>
<p>
    The
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tag grants a feat, or a list of feats, to
    a character, even if the character would not normally meet the
    requirements for that feat. The tag takes a pipe-delimited list and
    can be as long as desired, but must contain at least one feat. The
    feats included in the feat list must exist and you should NOT use
    the feats
    <code>OUPUTNAME</code>
    , if one exists for the feat you
    are granting. Also keep in mind that some feats have a
    <code>CHOOSE</code>
    built into them, such as
    <strong>
        <em>
            Weapon
            Focus
        </em>
    </strong>
    , while most don't.
    <em>
        <strong>
            Weapon
            Focus
        </strong>
    </em>
    , when applied, calls a chooser to allow the
    player to choose which weapon the focus will apply to. Let us
    assume the character selects the
    <strong>
        <em>
            Longsword
        </em>
    </strong>
    , which will be displayed as
    <em>
        <strong>
            Weapon Focus(Longsword)
        </strong>
    </em>
    . This causes some
    confusion when it comes to listing a feat with a parenthetical
    element, i.e.
    <strong>
        <em>
            Armor Proficiency (Heavy)
        </em>
    </strong>
    ,
    which is a unique feat with no
    <code>CHOOSE</code>
    command, and the
    afore mentioned
    <em>
        <strong>
            Weapon Focus(Longsword)
        </strong>
    </em>
    .
    PCGen differentiates between these two cases by the inclusion, or
    exclusion, of a space between the 'open' parentheses and the
    preceding alpha-character. For a feat with a built in
    <code>CHOOSE</code>
    command, there is NO intervening space while a
    unique feat with a parenthetical element has an intervening
    space.
</p>
<p>
    As stated before, the
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tag applies a feat
    irrespective of the prerequisites for that feat, but the
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tag also allows the application of new
    prerequisites through the use of the
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag. The
    new prerequisite will be applied to all feats listed in the
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tag. This could cause a problem if you wanted to
    apply two feats, each with their own prerequisites, but
    fortunately, not only can we include as many feats in the
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tag as we need, we can also include as many
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tags in the domain line as we need, each with
    its own
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    tag. If you browse through the
    <code>PRExxx</code>
    section of the global tag documentation, you
    will find many tags that can be used when applying virtual feats,
    but I will be going over only one of them here. That is the
    <code>PRELEVEL</code>
    tag.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <code>PRELEVEL</code>
    tag establishes a prerequisite for a
    character to have a minimum number of levels. Its form is simple,
    having as a single argument the minimum level required. The tag
    takes the following form:
    <code>PRELEVEL:&lt;minimum
        level&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
    With all of this in mind, the form the VFEAT tag takes in this
    file, with our selected PRExxx tag, is as follows:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>VFEAT:&lt;feat
        list&gt;|PRELEVEL:&lt;minimum level&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
    For the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Poetry
        </strong>
    </em>
    domain, we are applying
    two feats: the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Scribe Scolls
        </strong>
    </em>
    feat, which
    is granted a third level, and the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Great
            Intelligence
        </strong>
    </em>
    feat, which normally requires that the
    character have at least 21 levels. Additionally, we will apply the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Great Intelligence
        </strong>
    </em>
    feat several times,
    specifically when the character is at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and
    20th levels. Fortunately, the
    <em>
        <strong>
            Great
            Intelligence
        </strong>
    </em>
    feat is stackable so our application of
    the feat five times as the character advances from 1st to 20th
    level can be accommodated by simply including five
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tags, each with an appropriate
    <code>PRELEVEL</code>
    tag, five time. See our example below for the
    final
    <code>VFEAT</code>
    tag entries.
</p>
