   This lesson is intended to cover creating your own
"Languages".
  </p>
  <p>
   This LST file defines the languages that may be spoken, written
or read by a character. It is even simpler than the
   <span class="lstfile">
    weaponprofs.lst
   </span>
   file in that it consists of just
the language name and a TYPE tag for each one.
  </p>
  <p>
   The language LST files are where the
   <code>CHOOSE:LANG</code>
   tag generates its list from when it is invoked. This file also
tells PCGen, in conjunction with the
   <code>LANGBONUS</code>
   tag,
what languages are available for races to choose from as bonus
languages based on their primary language stat.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   &lt;Language Name&gt;
  </h4>
  <p>
   The language file is a lst file that has one language entry per
line. The first thing on each line is the name of the language.
There is no tag for it, the program assumes that whatever is there
at the beginning of the line is the name of a language.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>TYPE</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <code>TYPE</code>
   tag is used to set the type/group of the
language. It may take multiple types delimited by periods. The
types used are usually Spoken, Read, and Written. Some
examples:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>English TYPE:Spoken.Read.Written
     <br/>
     Sign Language TYPE:Spoken.Read
     <br/>
     Trade Pidgin TYPE:Spoken</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   That's really all there is to those simple .lst files.
