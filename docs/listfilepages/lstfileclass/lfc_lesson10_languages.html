<p>This file defines the languages that may be spoken, written or read by a 
  character. It is even simpler than the weaponprofs.lst file in that it 
  consists of just the language name and a TYPE tag for each one. 
<p>The language lst files are where the CHOOSE:Laguage() or 
  CHOOSE:Laguage(TYPE.)tag generates it's list from when it is invoked. This 
  file also tells PCGen what languages are available for races to choose from 
  with their bonus languages based on their primary language stat.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Language name</strong></p>
<p>The language file is a lst file that has one language entry per line. The first 
  thing on each line is the name of the language. There is no tag for it, the 
  program assumes that whatever is there at the beginning of the line is the name 
  of a language.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><code>TYPE</code></strong></p>
<p>The TYPE tag is used to set the type/group of the language. It may take 
  multiple types delimited by periods. The types used are usually Spoken, 
  Read, and Written. Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>English TYPE:Spoken.Read.Written<br>
    Sign Language TYPE:Spoken.Read<br>
    Trade Pidgin TYPE:Spoken</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's really all there is to those simple .lst files.</p>
