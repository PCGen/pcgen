<p>
    This is the beginning of several lessons that will be necessary
    to cover the creation of a race file. There are many tags, and some
    of them will take some seriously long explanations, so get some
    munchies and a drink, get comfortable and we'll get started.
</p>
<p>
    Since the race lines can get exceedingly long, and yahoo will
    wrap my lessons, I'll also post a file that may be perused as
    you're reading this. (Be sure to turn off word-wrap on your text
    file reader!)
</p>
<p>
    I'm going to develop a file that contains two races. One will be
    from the System Reference Document (SRD) so you can see how 
    to do an already existing race and the other I'm going to make up
    on the fly and use to demonstrate every tag I can remember. :p
</p>
<p>
    One thing to note is that these will be considered "monster"
    races. Towards the end of the lesson i'll go back through and
    create a player character only race.
</p>
<p>
    We'll do a Solar and, ummm, I know! Ninja Monkeys! :) The
    lessons will follow the format of a standard monster write up. A
    sample monster write up for our Ninja Monkey race is presented
    below so you can follow along (in RSRD format)

</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    First, a couple of general rules:  Every tag needs to be
    separated with tabs. Spaces may be used within names, etc, but
    never at the beginning or end. There should never be a space-tab or
    a tab-space combination as this will make the parser choke and
    die.
</p>
<p>
    Although any text editor will do, a text editor that can do
    syntax colorization is also a good idea. I use a program called
    TextPad. You can also use UltraEdit and I believe there is one
    called Crimson. You can find a number of these syntax files on the
    Yahoo! Group
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental">
        PCGen_experimental
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    I'll use "mystuff_races.lst" as the file name. This conforms to
    the new naming convention adopted by the PCGen lstmonkey crew
    recently. Basically it is in the format of
    "source_filetype.lst".
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    These classes were originally written using the SRD (3.0 rules).
    Throughout you will find sidebars like this one with notes on the
    differences between the 3.0 rule set and the 3.5 rule set as found
    in the Revised System Reference Document (RSRD).
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    Race Name
</p>
<p>
    The race file is currently a lst file that has one racial entry
    per line. The first thing on each line is the race name. There is
    no tag for it, the program assumes that whatever is there is the
    name of a race.
</p>
<p>
    One thing to consider when entering the race name is grouping
    (all demons together, etc). A Solar is a celestial, and we'd like
    it to show up with other celestials, so the name I'm going to enter
    will be "Celestial (Solar)". On the next Line I'll enter "Ninja
    Monkey".
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    In the RSRD the Solar is listed as an Angel not a Celestial.
    Therefore we would name it "Angel (Solar)".
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>OUTPUTNAME</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now, "Celestial (Solar)", while making it easy to find in the
    race list with the other celestials will look kind of funny on
    output, so we'll use the OUTPUTNAME tag to change what will appear
    on output (if the user has the preference checked to use it).
</p>
<p>
    The OUTPUTNAME tag can be used in a couple of different manners.
    You can completely change the name of an object (as far as output
    is concerned) and not reference the real name at all, or you can
    use part of the real name. A special string was developed to grant
    access to only the text contained in parentheses. That string is
    "[NAME]" (no quotes).
</p>
<p>
    So, if we wanted the name on output to be "Celestial, Solar", we
    could do it two different ways. 1) OUTPUTNAME:Celestial, Solar or
    2) OUTPUTNAME:Celestial, [NAME].  I don't like either one of
    those... I just want it to be called a "Solar" on output, so I'm
    entering the tag like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>OUTPUTNAME:[NAME]</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The name "Ninja Monkey" is just fine as it is, so we'll skip an
    OUTPUTNAME tag on this one.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        SIZE
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    Every creature has a size.  The size tag uses the first
    letter of each size category, so the possible choices are F (Fine),
    D (Diminutive), T (Tiny), S (Small), M (Medium), L (Large), H
    (Huge), G (Gargantuan), and C (Colossal).
</p>
<p>
    The Solar is a Large creature so on that line we'll enter a
    couple tabs and then put "
    <code>SIZE:L</code>
    ". The Ninja Monkey is
    man-sized (Medium), so we'll put "
    <code>SIZE:M</code>
    " on that
    line.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        RACETYPE/RACESUBTYPE
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    After the creature's size the next information is the race type.
    For the Solar it is listed as Outsider (Good). The information in
    the brackets after the type lists all the subtypes for the monster,
    in this case Good. We will enter "
    <code>RACETYPE:Outsider</code>
    "
    put in a tab and enter "
    <code>RACESUBTYPE:Good</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey we have to enter just the type with no
    subtypes.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sidebar">
    <strong>
        Update to RSRD
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Solar changes subtypes in the RSRD to Outsider (Angel,
    Extraplanar, Good). Therefore we need to change our subtype entry
    to read
    <code>RACESUBTYPE:Angel|Extraplanar|Good</code>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        TYPE
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    This use of TYPE has been deprecated and
    is replaced with
    <code>RACETYPE/RACESUBTYPE</code>
    .
</p>
<p>
    We use the TYPE tag to indicate what type of creature the race
    is (Aberration, Undead, Animal, Monstrous Humanoid, Magical Beast,
    etc.).
</p>
<p>
    The Solar is an Outsider so our tag would read
    "
    <code>TYPE:Outsider</code>
    ".
</p>
<p>
    The Ninja monkey is a Monstrous Humanoid so our tag would be
    "
    <code>TYPE:Monstrous Humanoid</code>
    ".
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        MONSTERCLASS
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    The MONSTERCLASS tag is used by the program when the "Default
    Monster" setting is off. It tells it how many and which monster
    class levels to give the race (as opposed to using the HITDICE tag
    when in "Default Monster" mode).
</p>
<p>
    The tag takes the format of
    MONSTERCLASS:&lt;monsterclassname&gt;:&lt;levels&gt;. For PCGen
    distribution files the class name is *usually* the type of creature
    and the number of levels is usually set equal to the number of HD
    the default creature has. An exception to this is when the racial
    description says they are spellcasters... "cast as 18th level
    sorcerers". In that case we create a special class (in a class.lst
    file) to grant the race the appropriate spellcasting levels.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar is an Outsider with 22 HD, and he casts spells as a
    20th level cleric, so his tag would be
    "
    <code>MONSTERCLASS:Solar:22</code>
    "
</p>
<p>
    For the Ninja Monkey, he's a Monstrous Humanoid and has 4 HD and
    no spellcasting ability, so the tag for him would read
    "
    <code>MONSTERCLASS:Monstrous Humanoid:4</code>
    ".
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <code><strong>
        HITDICE
    </strong></code>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    The PCGen data team is moving away from
    using the "Default Monster" setting. Default Monster Kits are being
    used instead.
</p>
<p>
    This is the tag we use to indicate the die size and quantity of
    hit dice a race gets. The program uses this when the "Default
    Monster" setting in the preferences is on. It takes the format of
    HITDICE:&lt;quantity&gt;,&lt;size&gt;. This information is found at
    the top of each race listing.
</p>
<p>
    The Solar has 22d8 hit points, so would have
    "
    <code>HITDICE:22,8</code>
    " for this tag.
</p>
<p>
    The ninja monkey has 4d8 hit points, so would have
    "
    <code>HITDICE:4,8</code>
    " for this tag.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    <strong>
        <code>MOVE</code>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    To define a race's movement modes and rates we use the MOVE tag.
    The format is "MOVE:mode,rate,mode,rate".   You can enter
    as many movement modes and rates as you want.
</p>
<p>
    Looking at the Solar in the SRD, they list "SPEED:50ft,fly
    150ft". The first number is always their "Walk" (otherwise known as
    "Base") movement rate, except for those races that can't walk like
    some plants. So on the Solar's line we will enter (remember to put
    a tab or two between the last tag and this new one):
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>MOVE:Walk,50,Fly,150</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    I'm going to give the Ninja Monkey a walk rate of 30 and a climb
    rate of 20, so the tag for his line would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <code>MOVE:Walk,30,Climb,20</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>

    I'm going to end this lesson at this point. If you have
