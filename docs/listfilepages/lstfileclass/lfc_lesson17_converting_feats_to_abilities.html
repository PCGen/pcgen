  <h2>
   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p class="indent0">
   Beginning with PCGen 5.12, and maturing in PCGen
5.14, the Ability object has been available to the lst monkey as a
more flexible tool than the existing Feat object. Though it was
originally conceived as a replacement for the Feat, it will take
quite some time before the Feat actually goes away, if it ever
does.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   This lesson will assist users in converting
their existing homebrew feats to the new Ability object. To
accomplish this, the lesson is broken into two sections, the Basic
Conversion and the Advanced Conversion. Within each of these
sections you will find discussion of each file that must be
modified, and the tags required to accomplish the conversion of
your homebrew feats.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   NOTE: Standard practice in PCGen distributed
datasets is to only use the ability object for those abilities that
had been implemented as hidden feats. Feats listed in the
sourcebooks as feats are implemented with the standard feat
object.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   What this lesson will not tell you is how to
create either Feats or Abilities. Both are very similar in
construction, using the same set of general tags to provide the
functionality required to implement the various game rules used.
The primary difference is that each
   <strong>
    ABILITY
   </strong>
   is
assigned to a specific
   <strong>
    CATEGORY
   </strong>
   . This means that
you can have several abilities with the same name, but each will be
of a separate category. The tags required to do this are covered
below.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Sample Feat
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   The
   <span class="lstobj">
    Expert Defense
   </span>
   hidden feat, included below, will be used as our example in this
LST file class.
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>Expert Defense</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>TYPE:Special</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>SAB:Expert Defense ~ Add % bonus to
AC|INT</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|INT</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Note: This hidden feat has been created
specifically for this LST File class.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Before We Begin
  </h3>
  <h4>
   File Names
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   You will see several LST files referenced within
this lesson. The file names used are generic file names and do not
represent what your files will need to be called. The general
convention used for official datasets within PCGen can be found in
the
   <a href="../../listfilepages/listfileLSTstandards.html">
    Official Release
Standards
   </a>
   . You are free to call your homebrew datasets by what
name you will, though I find it helps to include the object type
contained within the file in the name of the file. For the purposes
of this LST File class, we will use the following file names:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
   file for the converted abilities.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
   file for the new ability
categories.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_campaign.pcc
   </span>
   file for the campaign pcc file.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   Note: You can name your homebrew files anything
you wish as long as you include them in the your homebrew PCC
file.
  </p>
  <h4>
   LST File Class Style Guide
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate
what you would see in a LST file we are going to use certain
conventions to convey these ideas:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   1) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified
by
   <code>code</code>
   style.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   2) When referencing a specific PCGen object,
e.g. domain, feat, weapon, etc., I have included the name as a
   <span class="lstobj">
    LST Object
   </span>
   text, except for when the
object is part of a
   <code>code</code>
   example.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   3) Each new line should be considered a
   <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>
   in the actual file.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p class="indent1">
    Examples in this lesson will appear as:
   </p>
   <p class="indent2">
    <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Special Ability
Category</code>
   </p>
   <p class="indent2">
    <code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code>
   </p>
   <p class="indent1">
    Will in the LST file appear as:
   </p>
   <p class="indent2">
    <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Special Ability
Category</code>
    &lt;tab&gt;
    <code>CATEGORY:Special
Ability</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>
   Special Note for the LST Student
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   Finally, for those of you that have gone through
the previous LST Classes, some of the global tags will be
repetitive. Feel free to skip those portions if you like. These
classes are being written for the new LST-Monkey, so there will be
some overlap, but a student of the classes does not need to take
them in order.
  </p>
  <hr style="height:3px;"/>
  <h2>
   The Conversion
  </h2>
  <p class="indent0">
   The basic process of converting "Feats" to
"Abilities" is to create a new file called
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
   and then copy the homebrew feats
that you wish to convert to the new file and removing them from the
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_feats.lst
   </span>
   file. You will then need
to add the appropriate
   <code>CATEGORY</code>
   tag to the copied
feats, making sure that any new ability categories are properly
defined in the
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
   file. The next step is to
modify your hombrew
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_campaign.pcc
   </span>
   file by adding the
   <code>ABILITY</code>
   and
   <code>ABILITYCATEGORY</code>
   tags. The relevant files and tags to
acomplish this are explained below.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h3>
   The Ability File
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   The
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
   file is where your converted
feats will be placed. Fortunately, the tags you use in this file
are very similar to those used in the
   <span class="lstfile">
    feats.lst
   </span>
   file. The major difference between these
two files is that you will need to add the
   <code>CATEGORY</code>
   tag to your converted feat to make it an ability. To get an idea of
how to build feats, you can look up
   <a href="lfc_lesson12_feat1.html">
    LST File Class #12
   </a>
   and
   <a href="lfc_lesson13_feat2.html">
    LST File Class #13
   </a>
   , Feat LST Classes
Parts 1 and 2. There will eventually be a LST FIle Class for
Abilities so you can check back periodically to see if it's been
released yet.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   &lt;Ability Name&gt;
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   Every ability line must begin with the name of
the ability. You can use any name you prefer as long as it conforms
to the standard requirements for feat names. For our purposes in
this class, we will be using the same name we used for our sample
feat. This means our new ability will be called
   <code>Expert
Defense</code>
   .
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   Note: You can have two abilities with the same
name as long as they are of different categories, i.e. the
   <code>CATEGORY</code>
   tag specifies a different category for each
ability.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    Example:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>Expert Defense</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   Amazingly enough, our new ability has the same
name as our old feat.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>CATEGORY:My Super Ability</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This tag identifies the 'category' in which your
new ability will be placed. In the case of our example ability, we
are placing it in the
   <span class="lstobj">
    My Super Ability
   </span>
   category. Any category, besides 'FEAT', must have been defined in
the
   <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
   or
   <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
   file to be valid. See "The
Ability Category File" file below.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   Note: While ability categories can be named
whatever you decide upon, when using the hardcoded
   <span class="lstobj">
    FEAT
   </span>
   category, you must use all caps as that is the
way it is hardcoded within PCGen.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   Our New Ability
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   All other tags in our example feat are used as
is in our new ability. The final Ability object is shown below:
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>Expert Defense</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>CATEGORY:My Super Ability</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>TYPE:Special</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>SAB:Expert Defense ~ Add % bonus to
AC|INT</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|INT</code>
  </p>
  <hr style="height:3px;"/>
  <h3>
   The Ability Category File
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   The
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
   file defines the various
ability categories that an ability can be assigned to. These
categories will determine where, within the PCGen user interface,
the related abilities will appear. In general, they will appear in
a sub-tab on the "Feats &amp; Abilities" tag.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   There are a number of ability categories built
into PCGen's various datasets, all defined in either the loaded
gamemode's
   <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
   file or the
loaded dataset's
   <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
   file. For Homebrews, you'll need to either use one of these
existing ability categories or set up your own "Ability Category",
which in turn will create a separate "pool" with which to manage
your converted abilities. To demonstrate how this is done, we'll
use the
   <span class="lstobj">
    My Super Ability
   </span>
   category.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Super Ability</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   The first entry in the ABILITYCATEGORY line is
the name of the new ability category which identifies the
"ABILITYPOOL". This ability pool governs how many abilities can be
taken, if they cost anything at all. The "ABILITYCATEGORY" tag is
not strictly required as PCGen will take the first data entry as
the name of the ability category, and thus the ability pool, but
current PCGen standard practice is to include the tag.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   If this ability category is defined as "visible"
(See the "VISIBLE" tag below), any ability given this category will
appear in the "Feats &amp; Abilities" tab under a sub-tab of the
same name as this ability category. In this case,
   <span class="lstobj">
    My Super Ability
   </span>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This is a 'super-category', or parent, to which
our new ability category belongs. This tag is optional but if
included must list an existing ability category that has been
defined in either the
   <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
   file, an already loaded
   <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
   file, or your new
   <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
   file.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>TYPE:Special</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This is a
   <strong>
    TYPE
   </strong>
   , or list of
types, assigned to abilities of this catgory. While some types do
not have an effect other than allowing additional filtering in the
GUI, as is the case with the type
   <span class="lstobj">
    Special
   </span>
   , there are a number of standard ability
types used within PCGen that effect PCGen in different ways.
   <span class="lstobj">
    SpecialQuality
   </span>
   and
   <span class="lstobj">
    SpecialAttack
   </span>
   are used to determine where on the
Output Sheet the associated abilities will be placed.
   <span class="lstobj">
    FavoredEnemy
   </span>
   ,
   <span class="lstobj">
    RogueAbilities
   </span>
   , and
   <span class="lstobj">
    General
   </span>
   effect which sub-tab the associated
abilities will appear on in the PCGen GUI.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   A complete list of standard feat and ability
types can be found on the
   <a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilestype.html#feat">
    Global TYPE
   </a>
   page.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>PLURAL:My Super Abilities</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This has to do with the internationalization. An
example is:
   <code>in_feats</code>
   which sets the category key to
'in_feats'. It also shows up with the 'Plural' of the name. An
example of this is
   <code>Feat</code>
   would be
   <code>Feats</code>
   .
(Feats would display in the drop down bar).
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>EDITABLE:NO</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This defines whether a user can modify the
abilities in the category.
   <strong>
    NO
   </strong>
   would be appropriate
for class abilities which aren't chosen by the user.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>EDITPOOL:NO</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This defines whether a user can modify the pool
number or not. Generally each ability has a 'cost' with a default
cost of 1. If this option is set to
   <strong>
    NO
   </strong>
   the user
cannot manually add or subtract from the pool. For feats, the
default is
   <strong>
    YES
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This defines whether the pool must be a whole
number or can be fractions. Some abilities may have a cost less
than '1' like .5 or .25. Available options are
   <code>YES</code>
   or
   <code>NO</code>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>POOL:0</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   This tag establishes the base ability pool for
the defined ability category. It will take a number, formula, or
variable. If a variable is used, the variable
   <strong>
    MUST
   </strong>
   be defined by a
   <code>DEFINE</code>
   tag. For our new ability
category, we will start with an ability pool of zero (0).
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   Defines whether this category is visible on the
UI or it is hidden. This tag is useful for hidden abilities and
class abilities that require no interaction from the user.
Available options are -
   <code>YES</code>
   ,
   <code>NO</code>
   , or
   <code>QUALIFY</code>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   <code>DISPLAYLOCATION</code>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   The
   <code>DISPLAYLOCATION</code>
   is optional but
will identify the sub-tab upon which the associated abilities will
be displayed. Examples of some standard locations defined in the
RSRD data set are "Class Abilities" and "Special Qualities and
Attacks". If it is not included the
   <code>PLURAL</code>
   text will
be used instead.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   We will not be including this tag in our example
ability category so you can look for our converted abilities under
the "My Special Abilities" sub-tab.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Well, you could if we had not included the
   <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
   tag in our ability category entry.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   Our New Ability Category
  </h4>
  <p class="indent0">
   The new entry in
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
   is shown below:
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Super

  <h3>
   The PCC File
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   PCGen will use our
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_campaign.pcc
   </span>
   file to identify which source
files to load as well as other information about the 'campaign'.
Without these files and the related information, PCGen would not be
able to load any datafiles. For the purposes of this lesson, there
are only two tags we need to cover: The
   <code>ABILITY:my_abilities.lst</code>
   tag and the
   <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:my_abilitycategories.lst</code>
   tag.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   PCGen will look in the
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
   file for our newly converted
abilities and in
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
   file for any new ability
categories required to define the new abilities. These file
references are relative to the PCC file itself so if you provide no
specific path beyond the file names, PCGen will look in the same
directory in which the pcc file is contained.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   There are three ways to call a file from an
absolute location within the PCGen installation. These are:
  </p>
  <ol class="indent1">
   <li>
    The "at" symbol (@) will load the file from a path relative to
the data folder. (Example:
    <code>ABILITY:@/d20ogl/srd35/basics/rsrd_abilities_class.lst</code>
    )
   </li>
   <li>
    The ampersand (&amp;) will load the file from a path relative
to the vendor data folder. (Example:
    <code>ABILITY:&amp;/complete_monkey/complete_monkey_abilities.lst</code>
    )
   </li>

   Final Thoughts

  <p class="indent0">
   Unless you've made a new Ability Category, all
feats converted to abilities will show up on the 'Feats' tab as
normal. Great examples of new ability categories can be seen in the
RSRD/SRD for the
   <span class="lstobj">
    Fighter
   </span>
   ,
   <span class="lstobj">
    Wizard
   </span>
   and
   <span class="lstobj">
    Rogue
   </span>
   class.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Remember,
   <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
   is a gamemode file, to define new
ability categories or subcategories you MUST create it there. There
are entries about them in the docs if you want to read up on them.
To call the ability file it's (as you guessed),
   <code>ABILITY:ability.lst</code>
   , in the .pcc file. Basically
pretend that an
   <span class="lstfile">
    ability.lst
   </span>
   is a feat
file as far as what tags you can use in it and you'll be ok (fair
warning though, there may be exceptions to that rule of thumb).
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   You may continue to use
   <a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#prefeat">
    PREFEAT
   </a>
   when testing for the converted abilities as a prerequisite, as long
as you use the
   <code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code>
   tag, but it is
recommended that you use
   <a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#preability">
    PREABILITY
   </a>
   instead. If you use any other category, e.g.
   <code>CATEGORY:MySpecialAbility</code>
   , you
   <strong>
    MUST
   </strong>
   use the
   <code>PREABILITY</code>
   tag to check for your new abilities
as prerequisites.
