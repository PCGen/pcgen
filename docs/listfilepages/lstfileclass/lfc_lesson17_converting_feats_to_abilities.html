		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="indent0">Beginning with PCGen 5.12, and maturing in PCGen 5.14, the Ability 
			object has been available to the lst monkey as a more flexible tool than the existing 
			Feat object. Though it was originally conceived as a replacement for the Feat, it will 
			take quite some time before the Feat actually goes away, if it ever does.</p>
		<p class="indent0">This lesson will assist users in converting their existing homebrew 
			feats to the new Ability object. To accomplish this, the lesson is broken into two 
			sections, the Basic Conversion and the Advanced Conversion. Within each of these 
			sections you will find discussion of each file that must be modified, and the tags 
			required to accomplish the conversion of your homebrew feats.</p>
		<p class="sidebar1">NOTE: Standard practice in PCGen distributed datasets is to only use 
			the ability object for those abilities that had been implemented as hidden feats.  
			Feats listed in the sourcebooks as feats are implmented with the standard feat object.</p>
		<p class="indent0">What this lesson will not tell you is how to create either Feats or 
			Abilities. Both are very similar in construction, using the same set of general tags 
			to provide the functionality required to implement varied game rules used. The primary 
			difference is that each &quot;ABILITY&quot; is assigned to a specific &quot;CATEGORY&quot;. 
			This means that you can have several abilities with the same name, but each will be of a 
			separate category. The tags required to do this are covered below.</p>
		<p></p>

		<h3>Sample Feat</h3>
		<p class="indent0">The <span clss="lstobj">Expert Defense</span> hidden feat, included below, 
			will be used as our example in this LST file class.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>Expert Defense</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:Special</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>SAB:Expert Defense ~ Add % bonus to AC|INT</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|INT</code></p>
		<p class="indent0">Note: This hidden feat has been created specifically for this LST File class.</p>

		<h3>Before We Begin</h3>
		<h4>File Names</h4>
		<p class="indent0">You will see several LST files referenced within this lesson.  The 
			files names used are generic file names and do not represent what your files will need to 
			be called. The general convention used for official datasets within PCGen can be found in 
			the <a href="../../listfilepages/listfileLSTstandards.html">Official Release Standards</a>. 
			You are free to call your homebrew datasets by what name you will, though I find it helps 
			to include the object type contained within the file in the name of the file. For the 
			purposes of this LST File class, we will use the following file names:
		<p class="indent1"><span class="lstfile">my_abilities.lst</span> file for the converted abilities.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><span class="lstfile">my_abilitycategpries.lst</span> file for the new abilities categories.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><span class="lstfile">my_campaign.pcc</span> file for the campaign pcc file.</p>
		<p class="sidebar1">Note: You can name your homebrew files anything you wish as long as you 
			include them in the your homebrew PCC file.</p>

		<h4>LST File Class Style Guide</h4>
		<p class="indent0">Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate what you would see in a LST 
  		file we are going to use certain conventions to convey these ideas:</p>
		<p class="indent1">1) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified by <code>code</code> 
			style.</p>
		<p class="indent1">2) When referencing a specific PCGen object, i.e. domain, feat, weapon, etc., 
			I have included the name as a <span class="lstobj">LST Object</span> text, except for when 
			the object is part of a <code>code</code> example.</p>
		<p class="indent1">3) Each new line should be considered a <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> in the actual file.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="indent1">Examples in this lesson will appear as:</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Special Ability Category</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code></p>
			<p class="indent1">Will in the LST file appear as:</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Special Ability Category</code> &lt;tab&gt; <code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code></p>
		</blockquote>

		<h4>Special Note for the LST Student</h4>
		<p class="indent0">Finally, for those of you that have gone through the previous LST Classes, some of 
			the global tags will be repetitive. feel free to skip those portions if you like. These 
			classes are being written for the new LST-Monkey, so there will be some overlap, but a 
			student of the classes does not need to take them in order.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr style="height:3px">

		<h2>The Conversion</h2>
		
		<p class="indent0">The basic process of converting &quot;Feats&quot; to &quot;Abilities&quot; 
			is to create a new file called <span class="lstfile">my_abilities.lst</span> and then copy 
			the homebrew feats that you wish to convert to the new file and removing them from the 
			<span class="lstfile">my_feat.lst</span> file. You will then need to add the appropriate 
			<code>CATEGORY</code> tag to the copied feats, making sure that any new ability categories 
			are properly defined in the <span class="lstfile">my_abilitycategories.lst</span> file. 
			The next step is to modify your hombrew <span class="lstfile">my_campaign.pcc</span> file 
			by adding the <code>ABILITY</code> and <code>ABILITYCATEGORY</code> tags. The relevant files 
			and tags to acomplish this are explained below.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h3>The Ability File</h3>
		<p class="indent0">The <span class="lstfile">my_abilities.lst</span> file is where your converted 
			feats will be placed. Fortunately, the tags you use in this file are very similar to those 
			used in the <span class="lstfile">feat.lst</span> file. The major difference between these 
			two files is that you will need to add the <code>CATEGORY</code> tag to your converted feat 
			to make it an ability. To get an idea of how to build feats, you can look up 
			<a href="lfc_lesson12_feat1.html">LST File Class #12</a> and 
			<a href="lfc_lesson13_feat2.html">LST File Class #13</a>, Feat LST Classes Parts 1 and 2. 
			There will eventually be a LST FIle Class for Abilities so you can check back periodically 
			to see if its been released yet.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4>&lt;Ability Name&gt;</h4>
		<p class="indent0">Every ability line must begin with the name of the ability. You can use 
			any name you prefer as long as it conforms to the standard requirements for feat names. 
			For our purposes in this class, we will be using the same name we used for our sample 
			feat. This means our new ability will be called <code>Expert Defense</code>.</p>
		<p class="sidebar1">Note: You can have two abilities with the same name as long as they 
			are of different categories, i.e. the <code>CATEGORY</code> tag specifies a different 
			category for each ability.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>Expert Defense</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Amazingly enough, our new ability has the same name as our old feat.</p>
		<p></p

<hr>

		<h4><code>CATEGORY:My Super Ability</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This tag identifies the 'category' in which your new ability 
			will be placed. In the case of our example ability, we are placing it in the 
			<span class="lstobj">My Super Ability</span> category. Any category, besides 
			'FEAT', must have been defined in the <span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> 
			or <span class="lstfile">abilitycategory.lst</span> file to be valid. See 
			&quot;The Ability Category File&quot; file below.</p>
		<p class="sidebar1">Note: While abilitiy categories can be named whatever you decide upon, 
			when using the hardcoded <span class="lstobj">FEAT</span> category, you must use 
			all caps as that is the way it is hardcoded within PCGen.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4>Our New Ability</h4>
		<p class="indent0">All other tags in our example feat are used as is in our new ability.  The final 
			Ability object is shown below:</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>Expert Defense</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:My Super Ability</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:Special</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>SAB:Expert Defense ~ Add % bonus to AC|INT</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|INT</code></p>
		<p></p>
		
<hr style="height:3px">

		<h3>The Ability Category  File</h3>

		<p class="indent0">The <span class="lstfile">my_abilitycategories.lst</span> file defines 
			the various ability categories that an ability can be assigned to. These categories 
			will determine where, within the PCGen user interface, the related abilities will appear. 
			In general, they will appear in a sub-tab on the &quot;Feats & Abilities&quot; tag.</p>
		<p class="indent0">There are a number of ability categories built into PCGen's various datasets, 
			all defined in either the loaded gamemode's <span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> file 
			or the loaded dataset's <span class="lstfile">abilitycategory.lst</span> file. For Homebrews, 
			you'll need to either use one of these existing ability categories or set up your own &quot;Ability 
			Category&quot;, which in turn will create a separate &quot;pool&quot; with which to manage 
			your converted abilities. To demonstrate how this is done, we'll use the 
			<span class="lstobj">My Super Ability</span> category.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Super Ability</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">The first entry in the ABILITYCATEGORY line is the name of the new 
			ability category which identifies the &quot;ABILITYPOOL&quot;. This ability pool 
			governs how many abilities can be taken, if they cost anything at all. The 
			&quot;ABILITYCATEGORY&quot; tag is not strictly required as PCGen will take the 
			first data entry as the name of the ability category, and thus the ability pool, 
			but current PCGen standard practice is to include the tag.</p>
		<p class="indent0">If this ability category is defines as &quot;visible&quot; (See the 
			&quot;VISIBLE&quot; tag below), any ability given this category will appear in the 
			&quot;Feats & Abilities&quot; tab under a sub-tab of the same name as this ability 
			category. In this case, <span class="lstobj">My Super Ability</span>.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This is a 'super-category', or parent, to which our new ability category 
			belongs. This tag is optional but if included must list an existing ability category that 
			has been defined in either the <span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> or 
			<span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> file.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>TYPE:Special</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This is a TYPE, or list of types, assigned to abilities of this catgory. While some 
			types do not have an effect other than allowing additional filtering in the GUI, as is the case 
			with the type <span class="lstobj">Special</span>, there are a number of standard ability types 
			used within PCGen that effect PCGen in different ways. <span class="lstobj">SpecialQuality</span> 
			and <span class="lstobj">SpecialAttack</span> are used to determine where on the Output Sheet the 
			associated abilities will be placed. <span class="lstobj">FavoredEnemy</span>, 
			<span class="lstobj">RogueAbilities</span>,  and <span class="lstobj">General</span> effect which 
			sub-tab the associated abilities will appear on in the PCGen GUI.</p>
		<p class="indent0">A complete list of standard feat and ability types can be found on the 
			<a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilestype.html#Feat">Global TYPE</a> page.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>PLURAL:My Super Abilities</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This has to do with the internationalization. An example is: in_feats which sets the 
			Category key to 'in_feats'. It also shows up with the 'Plural' of the name. Ex. Feat would be Feats 
			(Feats would display in the drop down bar).</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>EDITABLE:NO</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This defines whether a user can modify the abilities in the category. NO would be 
			appropriate for class abilities which aren't chosen by the user.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>EDITPOOL:NO</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This defines whether a user can modify the pool number or not. Each ability has a 
			'cost' (Default is 1) if this option is set to 'NO' the user cannot add or subtract from the pool. 
			For feats, the default is 'YES'.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This defines whether the pool must be a whole number or can be fractions. Some 
			abilities may have a cost less than '1' like .5 or .25. &lt;YES / NO&gt;</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>POOL:0</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">This tag  establishes the base ability pool for the defined ability category. 
			It will take a number, formula, or variable. If a variable is used, the variable <strong>MUST</strong>
			be defined by a <code>DEFINE</code> tag. For our new ability category, we will start with an 
			ability pool of zero (0).</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4><code>VISIBLE:NO</code></h4>
		<p class="indent0">Defines whether this category is visible on the UI or hidden. Usefull for hidden 
			abilities and class abilities that require no interaction from the user. &lt;Options are - YES, 
			NO, QUALIFY&gt;</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4>DISPLAYLOCATION</h4>
		<p class="indent0">The <code>DISPLAYLOCATION</code> is optioonal but will identify the sub-tab 
			upon which the associated abilities will be displayed. Examples of some standard locations 
			defined in the RSRD data set are &quot;Class Abilities&quot; and &quot;Special Qualities and 
			Attacks&quot;. If it is not included the <code>PLURAL</code> taxt will be used instead.</p>
		<p class="indent0">We will not be including this tag in our example ability category so you can 
			look for our converted abilities under the &quot;My Special Abilities&quot; sub-tab.</p>
		<p class="indent0">Well, you could if we had not included the <code>VISIBLE:NO</code> tag in our 
			ability category entry.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h4>Our New Ability Category</h4>
		<p class="indent0">The new entry in <span class="lstfile">my_abilitycategories.lst</span> is shown below:</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Super Ability</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>PLURAL:My Super Abilities</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITABLE:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>POOL:0</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:NO</code></p>
		<p></p>
		
<hr style="height:3px">

		<h3>The PCC File</h3>
		<p class="indent0">PCGen will use our <span class="lstfile">my_campaign.pcc</span> file to identify 
			which source files to load as well as other information about the 'campaign'. Without these files 
			and the related information, PCGen would not be able to load any datafiles. For the purposes of 
			this lesson, there are only two tags we need to cover: The <code>ABILITY:my_abilities.lst</code> 
			tag and the <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:my_abilitycategories.lst</code> tag.</p>
		<p class="indent0">PCGen will look in the <span class="lstfile">my_abilities.lst</span> file for our 
			newly converted abilities and in <span class="lstfile">my_abilitycategories.lst</span> file for 
			any new ability categories required to define the new abilities. These file references are relative 
			to the PCC file itself so if you provide no specific path beyond the file names, PCGen will look 
			in the same directory in which the pcc file is contained.</p>
		<p class="indent0">There are three ways to call a file from an absolute location within the PCGen 
			installation. These are:</p>
		<ol class="indent1">
			<li>The &quot;at&quot; symbol (@) will load the file from a path relative to the data folder. 
				(Example: <code>ABILITY:@/d20ogl/srd35/basics/rsrd_abilities_class.lst</code>)</li>
			<li>The ampersand (&amp;) will load the file from a path relative to the vendor data folder. 
				(Example: <code>ABILITY:&/complete_monkey/complete_monkey_abilities.lst</code>)</li>
			<li>The asterisk (*) will load the file from a path relative to the vendor data folder and if that 
				does not exist, uses a path relative to the data folder. (Example: 
				<code>ABILITYCATEGORY:*/d20ogl/srd35/basics/rsrd_ability_categories_core.lst</code>)</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="indent0">More information about PCC files can be found in the 
			<a href="lfc_lesson01_pcc.html">PCC LST File Class</a>.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr style="height:3px">

		<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		
		<p class="indent0">Unless you've made a new Ability Category, all feats converted to abilities will 
			show up on the 'Feats' tab as normal. Great examples of new ability categories can be seen in 
			the RSRD/SRD for the <span class="lstobj">Fighter</span>, <span class="lstobj">Wizard</span> 
			and <span class="lstobj">Rogue</span> class.</p>
		<p class="indent0">Remember, miscinfo.lst is a gamemode file, to define new ability categories 
			or subcategories you MUST create it there. There are entries about them in the docs if you 
			want to read up on them.  To call the ability file it's (as you guessed), ABILITY:ability.lst, 
			in the .pcc file. Basically pretend that an ability.lst is a feat file as far as what tags 
			you can use in it and you'll be ok (fair warning though, there may be exceptions to that 
			rule of thumb).</p>
		<p class="indent0">You may continue to use 
			<a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#PREFEAT">PREFEAT</a> when 
			testing for the converted abilities as a prerequisite, as long as you use the 
			<code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code> tag, but it is recommended that you use 
			<a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#PREABILITY">PREABILITY</a> instead. 
			If you use any other category, e.g. <code>CATEGORY:MySpecialAbility</code> you MUST use the 
			<code>PREABILITY</code> tag to check for your new abilities as prerequisites.</p>
