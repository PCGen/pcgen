<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
    Beginning with PCGen 5.12, and maturing in PCGen
    5.14, the Ability object has been available to the lst monkey as a
    more flexible tool than the existing Feat object. Though it was
    originally conceived as a replacement for the Feat, it will take
    quite some time before the Feat actually goes away, if it ever
    does.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    This lesson will assist users in converting
    their existing homebrew feats to the new Ability object. To
    accomplish this, the lesson is broken into two sections, the Basic
    Conversion and the Advanced Conversion. Within each of these
    sections you will find discussion of each file that must be
    modified, and the tags required to accomplish the conversion of
    your homebrew feats.
</p>
<p class="sidebar1">
    NOTE: Standard practice in PCGen distributed
    datasets is to only use the ability object for those abilities that
    had been implemented as hidden feats. Feats listed in the
    sourcebooks as feats are implemented with the standard feat
    object.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    What this lesson will not tell you is how to
    create either Feats or Abilities. Both are very similar in
    construction, using the same set of general tags to provide the
    functionality required to implement the various game rules used.
    The primary difference is that each
    <strong>
        ABILITY
    </strong>
    is
    assigned to a specific
    <strong>
        CATEGORY
    </strong>
    . This means that
    you can have several abilities with the same name, but each will be
    of a separate category. The tags required to do this are covered
    below.
</p>
<h3>
    Sample Feat
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <span class="lstobj">
    Expert Defense
   </span>
    hidden feat, included below, will be used as our example in this
    LST file class.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>Expert Defense</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>TYPE:Special</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>SAB:Expert Defense ~ Add % bonus to
        AC|INT</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|INT</code>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Note: This hidden feat has been created
    specifically for this LST File class.
</p>
<h3>
    Before We Begin
</h3>
<h4>
    File Names
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    You will see several LST files referenced within
    this lesson. The file names used are generic file names and do not
    represent what your files will need to be called. The general
    convention used for official datasets within PCGen can be found in
    the
    <a href="../../listfilepages/listfileLSTstandards.html">
        Official Release
        Standards
    </a>
    . You are free to call your homebrew datasets by what
    name you will, though I find it helps to include the object type
    contained within the file in the name of the file. For the purposes
    of this LST File class, we will use the following file names:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
    file for the converted abilities.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
    file for the new ability
    categories.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
   <span class="lstfile">
    my_campaign.pcc
   </span>
    file for the campaign pcc file.
</p>
<p class="sidebar1">
    Note: You can name your homebrew files anything
    you wish as long as you include them in the your homebrew PCC
    file.
</p>
<h4>
    LST File Class Style Guide
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate
    what you would see in a LST file we are going to use certain
    conventions to convey these ideas:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    1) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified
    by
    <code>code</code>
    style.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    2) When referencing a specific PCGen object,
    e.g. domain, feat, weapon, etc., I have included the name as a
    <span class="lstobj">
    LST Object
   </span>
    text, except for when the
    object is part of a
    <code>code</code>
    example.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    3) Each new line should be considered a
    <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>
    in the actual file.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="indent1">
        Examples in this lesson will appear as:
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
        <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Special Ability
            Category</code>
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
        <code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code>
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
        Will in the LST file appear as:
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
        <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Special Ability
            Category</code>
        &lt;tab&gt;
        <code>CATEGORY:Special
            Ability</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Special Note for the LST Student
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    Finally, for those of you that have gone through
    the previous LST Classes, some of the global tags will be
    repetitive. Feel free to skip those portions if you like. These
    classes are being written for the new LST-Monkey, so there will be
    some overlap, but a student of the classes does not need to take
    them in order.
</p>
<hr style="height:3px;"/>
<h2>
    The Conversion
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
    The basic process of converting "Feats" to
    "Abilities" is to create a new file called
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
    and then copy the homebrew feats
    that you wish to convert to the new file and removing them from the
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_feats.lst
   </span>
    file. You will then need
    to add the appropriate
    <code>CATEGORY</code>
    tag to the copied
    feats, making sure that any new ability categories are properly
    defined in the
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
    file. The next step is to
    modify your hombrew
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_campaign.pcc
   </span>
    file by adding the
    <code>ABILITY</code>
    and
    <code>ABILITYCATEGORY</code>
    tags. The relevant files and tags to
    acomplish this are explained below.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>
    The Ability File
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
    file is where your converted
    feats will be placed. Fortunately, the tags you use in this file
    are very similar to those used in the
    <span class="lstfile">
    feats.lst
   </span>
    file. The major difference between these
    two files is that you will need to add the
    <code>CATEGORY</code>
    tag to your converted feat to make it an ability. To get an idea of
    how to build feats, you can look up
    <a href="lfc_lesson12_feat1.html">
        LST File Class #12
    </a>
    and
    <a href="lfc_lesson13_feat2.html">
        LST File Class #13
    </a>
    , Feat LST Classes
    Parts 1 and 2. There will eventually be a LST FIle Class for
    Abilities so you can check back periodically to see if it's been
    released yet.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    &lt;Ability Name&gt;
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    Every ability line must begin with the name of
    the ability. You can use any name you prefer as long as it conforms
    to the standard requirements for feat names. For our purposes in
    this class, we will be using the same name we used for our sample
    feat. This means our new ability will be called
    <code>Expert
        Defense</code>
    .
</p>
<p class="sidebar1">
    Note: You can have two abilities with the same
    name as long as they are of different categories, i.e. the
    <code>CATEGORY</code>
    tag specifies a different category for each
    ability.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <code>Expert Defense</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    Amazingly enough, our new ability has the same
    name as our old feat.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>CATEGORY:My Super Ability</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag identifies the 'category' in which your
    new ability will be placed. In the case of our example ability, we
    are placing it in the
    <span class="lstobj">
    My Super Ability
   </span>
    category. Any category, besides 'FEAT', must have been defined in
    the
    <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
    or
    <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
    file to be valid. See "The
    Ability Category File" file below.
</p>
<p class="sidebar1">
    Note: While ability categories can be named
    whatever you decide upon, when using the hardcoded
    <span class="lstobj">
    FEAT
   </span>
    category, you must use all caps as that is the
    way it is hardcoded within PCGen.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    Our New Ability
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    All other tags in our example feat are used as
    is in our new ability. The final Ability object is shown below:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>Expert Defense</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>CATEGORY:My Super Ability</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>TYPE:Special</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>SAB:Expert Defense ~ Add % bonus to
        AC|INT</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|INT</code>
</p>
<hr style="height:3px;"/>
<h3>
    The Ability Category File
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
    file defines the various
    ability categories that an ability can be assigned to. These
    categories will determine where, within the PCGen user interface,
    the related abilities will appear. In general, they will appear in
    a sub-tab on the "Feats &amp; Abilities" tag.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    There are a number of ability categories built
    into PCGen's various datasets, all defined in either the loaded
    gamemode's
    <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
    file or the
    loaded dataset's
    <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
    file. For Homebrews, you'll need to either use one of these
    existing ability categories or set up your own "Ability Category",
    which in turn will create a separate "pool" with which to manage
    your converted abilities. To demonstrate how this is done, we'll
    use the
    <span class="lstobj">
    My Super Ability
   </span>
    category.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Super Ability</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    The first entry in the ABILITYCATEGORY line is
    the name of the new ability category which identifies the
    "ABILITYPOOL". This ability pool governs how many abilities can be
    taken, if they cost anything at all. The "ABILITYCATEGORY" tag is
    not strictly required as PCGen will take the first data entry as
    the name of the ability category, and thus the ability pool, but
    current PCGen standard practice is to include the tag.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    If this ability category is defined as "visible"
    (See the "VISIBLE" tag below), any ability given this category will
    appear in the "Feats &amp; Abilities" tab under a sub-tab of the
    same name as this ability category. In this case,
    <span class="lstobj">
    My Super Ability
   </span>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This is a 'super-category', or parent, to which
    our new ability category belongs. This tag is optional but if
    included must list an existing ability category that has been
    defined in either the
    <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
    file, an already loaded
    <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
    file, or your new
    <span class="lstfile">
    abilitycategory.lst
   </span>
    file.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>TYPE:Special</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This is a
    <strong>
        TYPE
    </strong>
    , or list of
    types, assigned to abilities of this catgory. While some types do
    not have an effect other than allowing additional filtering in the
    GUI, as is the case with the type
    <span class="lstobj">
    Special
   </span>
    , there are a number of standard ability
    types used within PCGen that effect PCGen in different ways.
    <span class="lstobj">
    SpecialQuality
   </span>
    and
    <span class="lstobj">
    SpecialAttack
   </span>
    are used to determine where on the
    Output Sheet the associated abilities will be placed.
    <span class="lstobj">
    FavoredEnemy
   </span>
    ,
    <span class="lstobj">
    RogueAbilities
   </span>
    , and
    <span class="lstobj">
    General
   </span>
    effect which sub-tab the associated
    abilities will appear on in the PCGen GUI.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    A complete list of standard feat and ability
    types can be found on the
    <a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilestype.html#feat">
        Global TYPE
    </a>
    page.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>PLURAL:My Super Abilities</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This has to do with the internationalization. An
    example is:
    <code>in_feats</code>
    which sets the category key to
    'in_feats'. It also shows up with the 'Plural' of the name. An
    example of this is
    <code>Feat</code>
    would be
    <code>Feats</code>
    .
    (Feats would display in the drop down bar).
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>EDITABLE:NO</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This defines whether a user can modify the
    abilities in the category.
    <strong>
        NO
    </strong>
    would be appropriate
    for class abilities which aren't chosen by the user.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>EDITPOOL:NO</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This defines whether a user can modify the pool
    number or not. Generally each ability has a 'cost' with a default
    cost of 1. If this option is set to
    <strong>
        NO
    </strong>
    the user
    cannot manually add or subtract from the pool. For feats, the
    default is
    <strong>
        YES
    </strong>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This defines whether the pool must be a whole
    number or can be fractions. Some abilities may have a cost less
    than '1' like .5 or .25. Available options are
    <code>YES</code>
    or
    <code>NO</code>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>POOL:0</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    This tag establishes the base ability pool for
    the defined ability category. It will take a number, formula, or
    variable. If a variable is used, the variable
    <strong>
        MUST
    </strong>
    be defined by a
    <code>DEFINE</code>
    tag. For our new ability
    category, we will start with an ability pool of zero (0).
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    Defines whether this category is visible on the
    UI or it is hidden. This tag is useful for hidden abilities and
    class abilities that require no interaction from the user.
    Available options are -
    <code>YES</code>
    ,
    <code>NO</code>
    , or
    <code>QUALIFY</code>
    .
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    <code>DISPLAYLOCATION</code>
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <code>DISPLAYLOCATION</code>
    is optional but
    will identify the sub-tab upon which the associated abilities will
    be displayed. Examples of some standard locations defined in the
    RSRD data set are "Class Abilities" and "Special Qualities and
    Attacks". If it is not included the
    <code>PLURAL</code>
    text will
    be used instead.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    We will not be including this tag in our example
    ability category so you can look for our converted abilities under
    the "My Special Abilities" sub-tab.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Well, you could if we had not included the
    <code>VISIBLE:NO</code>
    tag in our ability category entry.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>
    Our New Ability Category
</h4>
<p class="indent0">
    The new entry in
    <span class="lstfile">

<h3>
    The PCC File
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    PCGen will use our
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_campaign.pcc
   </span>
    file to identify which source
    files to load as well as other information about the 'campaign'.
    Without these files and the related information, PCGen would not be
    able to load any datafiles. For the purposes of this lesson, there
    are only two tags we need to cover: The
    <code>ABILITY:my_abilities.lst</code>
    tag and the
    <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:my_abilitycategories.lst</code>
    tag.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    PCGen will look in the
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilities.lst
   </span>
    file for our newly converted
    abilities and in
    <span class="lstfile">
    my_abilitycategories.lst
   </span>
    file for any new ability
    categories required to define the new abilities. These file
    references are relative to the PCC file itself so if you provide no
    specific path beyond the file names, PCGen will look in the same
    directory in which the pcc file is contained.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    There are three ways to call a file from an
    absolute location within the PCGen installation. These are:
</p>
<ol class="indent1">
    <li>
        The "at" symbol (@) will load the file from a path relative to
        the data folder. (Example:
        <code>ABILITY:@/d20ogl/srd35/basics/rsrd_abilities_class.lst</code>
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        The ampersand (&amp;) will load the file from a path relative
        to the vendor data folder. (Example:
        <code>ABILITY:&amp;/complete_monkey/complete_monkey_abilities.lst</code>
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        The asterisk (*) will load the file from a path relative to the
        vendor data folder and if that does not exist, uses a path relative
        to the data folder. (Example:
        <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:*/d20ogl/srd35/basics/rsrd_ability_categories_core.lst</code>
        )
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="indent0">

<h2>
    Final Thoughts
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
    Unless you've made a new Ability Category, all
    feats converted to abilities will show up on the 'Feats' tab as
    normal. Great examples of new ability categories can be seen in the
    RSRD/SRD for the
    <span class="lstobj">
    Fighter
   </span>
    ,
    <span class="lstobj">
    Wizard
   </span>
    and
    <span class="lstobj">
    Rogue
   </span>
    class.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Remember,
    <span class="lstfile">
    miscinfo.lst
   </span>
    is a gamemode file, to define new
    ability categories or subcategories you MUST create it there. There
    are entries about them in the docs if you want to read up on them.
    To call the ability file it's (as you guessed),
    <code>ABILITY:ability.lst</code>
    , in the .pcc file. Basically
    pretend that an
    <span class="lstfile">
    ability.lst
   </span>
    is a feat
    file as far as what tags you can use in it and you'll be ok (fair
    warning though, there may be exceptions to that rule of thumb).
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    You may continue to use
    <a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#prefeat">
        PREFEAT
    </a>
    when testing for the converted abilities as a prerequisite, as long
    as you use the
    <code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code>
    tag, but it is
    recommended that you use
    <a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#preability">
        PREABILITY
    </a>
    instead. If you use any other category, e.g.
    <code>CATEGORY:MySpecialAbility</code>
    , you
    <strong>
        MUST
    </strong>
    use the
    <code>PREABILITY</code>
    tag to check for your new abilities
    as prerequisites.
