<h1>Tag Listing by File</h1>
<p>The Meat &amp; Potatoes of it all! The Holy Grail has been
found! Houston, we have landed on the Moon!</p>
<p>Well, okay, so maybe not that exciting, but it is as good as
sliced bread.&nbsp; A file by file listing of all the tags
currently in use by PCGen's list files! How, what, why, where,
when... all these questions answered!</p>
<p>Converting from Code-ese to English is a tough task, so
hopefully these pages are a coherent enough form of English for
everyone! (and if you speak Code-ese, go away! You're a Code
Monkey, this area is for List Monkeys! :p)</p>
