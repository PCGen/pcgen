<h1>
    Important Things to Know
</h1>
<p>
    There are a number of important things to remember when list
    editing, as well as a number of tricks that one can do to get the
    desired results. The following sections include the important stuff
    to know about list file editing, some are just informational use,
    some are requirements for turning in list files for the official
    releases. So if you've read this page AND the previous page, then
    the next couple of pages you should wade through before we get to
    the nitty gritty stuff.
</p>
<h2>
    Terms Used
</h2>
<p>
    The following terms are tossed about readily and easily, some
    interchangeably when talking to any list monkey, so make sure you
    are up on the latest lingo and how it's used!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        Source
Material
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - The gaming information provided by
            a publisher.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        PCC (pcc)
File
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - this is the extension used for the file
            that tells PCGen what list files to load, this is a text editable
            file.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        LST (lst or list)
File
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - Refers to a text editable file
            containing the specific entries read by PCGen to make a character
            (Feats, Skills, etc), and the .lst refers to the (commonly accepted
            and used) extension to save the files.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        Tag
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - A
            specific word used in list files that PCGen reads and recognizes as
            having an effect on a character.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        Source
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - Refers to the Source information specifically, as in, what source
            book, what page.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        Campaign
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - Refers to a
            collection of Source Material that is loaded as a group.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        TL
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            -
            Total Level. This is used in a lot of formulas for the tags.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    What you Need
</h2>
<p>
    You need only 2 things to get going, a text-editing program and
    patience.
</p>
<p>
    Editing or creating a list file can be a hardy experience and
    not one to take on lightly, but neither is it impossible to do.
    Paying attention to the syntax of how a tag works will save a lot
    of headaches when it comes time to test your
    modifications/creations within PCGen.
</p>
<p>
    Using existing list files as a reference can help you to
    understand how to construct anything you want to, from classes to
    feats, to spells, if you need an example, there is something in
    there for you to look at.
</p>
<h2>
    Syntax
</h2>
<p>
    This covers two areas, first, creating list files. PCGen does
    not care what you call your created files, whether it is .txt,
    .lst, .doc, or anything else for an extension. As long as you have
    the correct file name in the .pcc file, it will load. Second, the
    syntax of the tags used in the list files. The sections with the
    list file tags contain correct syntax to use for each tag. PCGen
    DOES care about this, if your syntax is wrong, then the tag you are
    working on will not work and PCGen will return errors.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            *IMPORTANT
        </em>
    </strong>
    - The other item of note,
    any line, in any list file, that begins with the pound sign (#), is
    a comment line. PCGen will ignore reading this line completely.
    (The purpose of this is to let others know what something is/does,
    what items are outstanding and need to be completed, or just notes
    on how something is working).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            *CRITICAL
        </em>
    </strong>
    - There can _NEVER_ be a
    space between fields. Always use a TAB between fields, as a space
    between fields will cause the list file to not load and/or return
    errors trying to load
</p>
<h2>
    Directory Structure
</h2>
<p>
    While the directory structure is changeable, there are some
    common practices to make it easier on everyone.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, all the Source Material list files are kept in the
    \pcgen\data directory, and they are then sorted by company name,
    usually the long name, but some "high profile" companies are
    generally shortened (Can we say SRD? I knew you could!).
</p>
<p>
    There is a custom directory provided to locate your own personal
    list files in, and by no means are you required to put them there,
    it is, after all, your computer, put them where you are comfortable
    with.
</p>
<p>
    When PCGen is installed, the basic directory structure will look
    like this (Assume you are installing on your C drive (C:\);
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen
            </strong>
            &lt;-- This is the root directory for
            PCGen
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\characters
            </strong>
            &lt;-- Default directory
            where PCGen saves characters to
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\data
            </strong>
            &lt;-- Base starting spot for the
            list files
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\data\&lt;company_name
            </strong>
            &gt; &lt;-- The
            root folder for the company's list files. There are too many
            sub-folders in this directory to list here. But taking a quick look
            at them, will show the suggested structure for setting up a
            company's list files.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\doc
            </strong>
            &lt;-- Where all the documentation
            on how to use and customize PCGen are located
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\system
            </strong>
            &lt;-- This is where PCGen's
            system wide used files are stored at
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\system\bio
            </strong>
            &lt;-- This is where the
            list files for randomly determining characters features are located
            (Hair, Skin, Eye color, Traits)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\system\bio\names
            </strong>
            &lt;-- This is where
            the list files for random name determination are located
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\system\specials
            </strong>
            &lt;-- This is where
            the list files for determining what bonuses stack and what special
            abilities are granted at various levels is located
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                C:\pcgen\templates
            </strong>
            &lt;-- This is where all the
            character &amp; party sheets are located. These sheets are set up
            to accept information directly from PCGen to print out
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Giving Credit where Credit is Due
</h2>
<p>
    Giving credit to the proper source from which a specific class,
    feat, spell, race, etc. came from is crucial.
</p>
<p>
    It not only gives the creator credit for their work, but it also
    lets the user know where it came from.
</p>
<p>
    Hopefully PCGen will be used as a sort of marketing tool by both
    gaming companies and by users - you can load sources based on
    material you don't own, and can generate characters based on that
    information, but you don't quite get enough information to use it
    accurately or completely without actually buying the source
    material.
</p>
<p>
    This way PCGen can whet your appetite for the kinds of options
    that are available if you purchase book xyz.
</p>
<p>
    My hope is that users will not have given much thought to
    purchasing some book until they decided to play with it in PCGen,
    and discovered that they really liked what they saw and went out
    and bought that book.
</p>
<p>
    Since PCGen doesn't give all the details about the various
    options, it's important that it be easy to look up for those who do
    own the books.
</p>
<p>
    Giving credit to the creators and letting users know where the
    option came from if they want to look it up is all accomplished via
    the SOURCE: tag which is available in all the main lst files.
</p>
<p>
    The SOURCE tag in all list files and comes in 3 varieties;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        SOURCELONG
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - This is
            for the full company and source material name
            <br/>
            e.g. SOURCELONG:Dominant Game Publisher - System Reference
            Document
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        SOURCESHORT
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - This is
            the books 3-10 letter short name
            <br/>
            e.g. SOURCESHORT:SRD
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       <em>
        SOURCEWEB
       </em>
      </strong>
     </span>
            - Is the URL
            of the publisher/source material
            <br/>
            e.g. SOURCEWEB:HTTP://www.rpgpublisher.com/
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    All 3 of these tags
    <span class="underline">
    <strong>
     MUST
    </strong>
   </span>
    appear in
    <span class="underline">
    <strong>
     ALL
    </strong>
   </span>
    pcc and lst files*.
</p>
<p>
    In the PCC file, the
    <code>SOURCExxx</code>
    tags must be on
    separate lines:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>SOURCELONG:Dominant Game Publisher -
        System Reference Document</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>SOURCESHORT:SRD</code>
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <code>SOURCEWEB:HTTP://www.rpgpublisher.com/</code>
</p>
<p>
    In LST files, the
    <code>SORCExxx</code>
    tags must be on one
    line, separated by a tab delimiter:
</p>
<blockquote class="indent2">
    <p class="tagindent2">
        <code>SOURCELONG:Dominant Game Publisher -
            System Reference Document</code>
        &lt;tab&gt;
        <code>SOURCESHORT:SRD</code>
        &lt;tab&gt;
        <code>SOURCEWEB:HTTP://www.rpgpublisher.com/</code>
    </p>
</blockquote>
