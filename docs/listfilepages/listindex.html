    the program.

        <strong>
            Updated:

        <strong>
            Deprecated:
        </strong>
    </div>
    Deprecated tags are scheduled to be removed from the program.
    Deprecated tags should still parse and work as they did before but
    will not in future versions. Deprecated tag entries should indicate
    the tag that replaces it.
