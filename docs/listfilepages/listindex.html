			<h1><a name="TAGINFO"></a>List Index Tag Information</h1>
			
			<p>This page contains notes on LST tags with multiple entries noting how similar or different the use of the tag is in each of the 
  			lines or files it is used in as well as additional information on the use of LST tags.</p>
		
			<h2>Tag state</h2>
			
			<p>Some tags are labeled New or Updated as well as Deprecate, Obsolete and Removed. </p>
			
			<div class=indent1><div class=alpha><strong>New: </strong></div>New tags usually indicate the version in which they were added to the program.</div>
			
			<div class=indent1><div class=alpha><strong>Updated: </strong></div>Updated tags also indicate the version in which they were updated.</div>
			
			<div class=indent1><div class=alpha><strong>Deprecated: </strong></div>Deprecated tags are scheduled to be removed from the program. Deprecated tags should still
			parse and work as they did before but will not in future versions. Deprecated tag entries should indicate the tag that replaces it.</div>
			
			<div class=indent1><div class=alpha><strong>Obsolete: </strong></div>The tag should still parse but should no longer work.
			Any attempt to load it will display an error message indicating that the tag is no longer supported.</div>
			
			<div class=indent1><div class=alpha><strong>Removed: </strong></div>The tag should no longer even parse.
			Any attempt to load the tag should generate an unrecognized tag error the same as any other bad tag name.</div>
