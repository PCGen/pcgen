<h1>List File Main</h1>
<p>List file editing can be a daunting task, so many tags, what
    tags to use, where to use them!&nbsp; Well, in the sections that
    follow, we reveal all the secrets that the master monkeys use! So
    sit back, grab that Code Monkey Snack (TM Pending) or a banana and
    prepare to be astounded, amazed, stunned, and other wise bored
    senseless if you have no desire to list edit!</p>
<p>We have several resources to help those wishing to learn the
    arcane craft of dataset creation</p>
<p>A good place to start is the <a href=
                                           "lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">LST File Classes</a>, they
    give a good overview of the basics of the dataset structure as well
    as detailed instructions on coding races.</p>
<p>Another good resource is the homebrew/my_dataset directory in
    the data folder. This is a framework for a PCGen dataset. It is
    meant for beginners who want to take their first steps in entering
    their own custom data into PCGen and have found that the built-in
    List Editors are too limiting for what they intend to do. It
    contains some commented out examples and a lot of advice and tips
    for putting your own sets together. You can get up and running fast
    by renaming the elements in this set to your suit your needs.</p>
Once you start delving deep into LST code you're going to want to
keep the <a href="../navlistindex.html">LST Index</a> handy. Most
LST tags have been documented with details on their use.
<p>There are <a href="../standards.html">Standards</a> to follow
    when creating a doc entry for a LST token.</p>
