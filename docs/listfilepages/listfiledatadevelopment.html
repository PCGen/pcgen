<h1>
    New Source Development
</h1>
<p>
    This is the process for developing datasets for inclusion in
    PCGen. Those familiar with how this process has worked in the past
    will note that it is essentially unchanged with the exception that
    the point at which a review of the source for OGL compliance
    and Publisher permission needed before the source can be entered
    into the Git repository is now handled on an internal issue by the
    Publisher Liaison, Data License and Content Silverbacks.
</p>
<h2>
    Initial Development
</h2>
<p>
    It begins as always with our volunteers creating the datasets.
    The style of this stage of development is entirely up the
    individual monkey who is developing the set, they are free to
    upload the work to pcgen_experimental for review or not. Smaller
    sources being done by individually monkeys should ideally be
    complete or near complete before being submitted for entry into
    Git. Larger projects, such as core sources or SRD additions that
    are being developed by several monkeys which could benefit from the
    cooperative nature of Git do not have to be complete but should be
    a good ways towards this point. It will be the Lead Data Monkeys
    call when it should be submitted.
</p>
<h2>
    Resources
</h2>
<p>
    The following resources are available to aid volunteers learn to
    create LST files. The first place to go is the Documentation, which
    you are reading now. There are a variety of pages dealing with LST
    files designed to help get you up and running. For beginners we
    have a growing section of lessons in the
    <a href="lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">
        LST file Class
    </a>
    . If you
    are creating datasets for inclusion in PCGen you should pay close
    attention to the section on
    <a href="listfileLSTstandards.html">
        Official Release LST standards
    </a>
    especially to the section on
    <a href="listfileLSTstandards.html#ogl">
        OGL Compliance
    </a>
    . The docs are
    also available
    <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/autobuilds/pcgen-docs/index.html">
        online
    </a>
    on our
    <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/autobuilds/">
        autobuild
        site
    </a>
    and are updated periodically.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the main
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/">
        PCGen Yahoo group
    </a>
    we
    have several other lists to aid in data development.
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/">
        pcgen_experimental
    </a>
    is used for development. You can get in touch with other data
    monkeys here and upload your files for others to review. It is a
    good place to coordinate activity if multiple monkeys are working
    on a source. Additionally it is the place where new LST syntax and
    new tags are developed.
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp/">
        PCGenListFileHelp
    </a>
    is the place to go for help with specific how-to problems with LST
    files.
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LSTfileclass/">
        LSTFileClass
    </a>
    is a
    group set up to publish lessons on how to create LST files. The LST
    File Classes here in the docs were originally published there.
</p>
<h2>
    Inclusion in Git
</h2>
<p>
    When a source has been completed and is ready for inclusion in
    the program it may be submitted in one of several ways. Data sets
    can be uploaded to
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/">
        pcgen_experimental
    </a>
    to the appropriate folder and, along with a shout out to your
    friendly neighborhood tracker monkey, they will be picked up for
    review. Once submitted the data must pass an internal review before
    it can be included in the Git repository.
</p>
<p>
    When a new source is submitted for inclusion in PCGen an
    internal issue is opened for the Source. This is a special issue
    for tracking New Source Development and will be the repository for
    all permission and OGL status reports concerning the source. This
    issue will only contain permission and OGL status reports, bug
    reports and the like will be entered in separately in the regular
    issues. It will be closed when it has passed all the required
    reviews and is checked in to the Git repository.
</p>
<p>
    New submission issues will be opened by the Content Silverback
    or the Chief Data Monkey. The dataset will be checked for obvious
    errors that would prevent it from running in PCGen as well as for
    completeness. Basically we are checking for show stoppers and not
    much more. If we find a major problem we will contact the author to
    get it resolved.
</p>
<p>
    If the dataset meets these minimum requirement it is zipped up
    and attached to the issue. The issue is then reassigned to the Open
    Game License (OGL) personnel. If problems are found the issue is
    reassigned back to Data who will work to resolve the issue. Once
    resolved issue is again reassigned to OGL.
</p>
<p>
    When OGL passes the Source it is reassigned to Publisher Liaison
    (PL) who will attach publisher permission to the issue, though the
    PL need not wait for this step and may attach permissions at any
    time he receives them.
</p>
<p>
    When the source has passed OGL and PL the issue is reassigned to
    the Lead Data Monkey who will commit the dataset in the appropriate
    directory. The issue is then closed.
</p>
<h2>
    Alpha Development
</h2>
<p>
    At this point the dataset author will be invited to continue
    development and be granted Git access to continue work on the set.
    QA should be informed that a new set is in Git which needs to be
    reviewed. The author, the QA team and the Tracker Monkey team will
    then work together to bring the set up to release quality. Once the
    Dataset has been though the QA process and all known issues have
    been resolved it is moved into a permanent location in the data
    directory.
