    The Meat &amp; Potatoes of it all! The Holy Grail has been
    found! Houston, we have landed on the Moon!

    Well, okay, so maybe not that exciting, but it is as good as
    sliced bread. A file by file listing of all the tags currently in
    use by PCGen's list files! How, what, why, where, when... all these
    questions answered!

    Converting from Code-ese to English is a tough task, so
    hopefully these pages are a coherent enough form of English for
    everyone! (and if you speak Code-ese, go away! You're a Code
    Monkey, this area is for List Monkeys! :p)
