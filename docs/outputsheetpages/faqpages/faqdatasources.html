            Even though Wizards of the Coast produces those books, they
            don't own exclusive rights to that material. We'll need to get
            permission from both Wizards and the other copyright owner(s) of
            said material before we can include them in PCGen. It is our
            intention to acquire this permission, but we're being very careful
            about how we proceed to maximize our chance of success. We'll keep
            everyone informed when anything worthy of reporting occurs. :)

      How do I include sources from Game Mode
X in Game Mode Y that I currently use?
     </span>

        <p>
            It is possible to do this, but you need to understand that this
            will, more than likely, cause errors due to incompatibility of the
            game modes..
        </p>
        <p>
            To include all of Game Mode X's sources in Game Mode Y.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the system/gamemode folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose the Y game mode folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open miscinfo.lst.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find the ALLOWEDMODES tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Append '|X' to this line.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Now, all of the sources associated with Game Mode X will show up
            in Y. Remember, errors are likely doing this.
        </p>
        <p>
            To include specific sources from game mode X in game mode Y.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the *.pcc of the game mode X source in question.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find the GAMEMODE tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open miscinfo.lst.
            </li>
            <li>
                Append '|Y' to this line.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat for every source wanted.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Now, all of these specific sources from game mode X will show up
            in Y. Remember, errors are likely for doing this.
