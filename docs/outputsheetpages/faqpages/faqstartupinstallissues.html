      Where do I download PCGen
from?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     You can download the latest version of PCGen from:
     <br/>
     <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/">
      http://pcgen.sourceforge.net
     </a>
    </p>
    You'll need to download at least:
    <ul>
     <li>
      pcgenXXX_part1of3.zip - The Program files
     </li>
     <li>
      pcgenXXX_part2of3.zip - The various source &amp; list files for
the products currently supported (see:
      <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/publishersinpcgen.php">
       http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/publishersinpcgen.php
      </a>
      for the current list)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    A third file can also be downloaded:
    <ul>
     <li>
      pcgenXXX_part3of3.zip - The full documentation &amp; output
sheet set (This is recommended for
      <strong>
       power
      </strong>
      users -
oh, go on, you know you are a
      <strong>
       power
      </strong>
      user!)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     And because I _know_ someone is going to ask, the XXX stands for
the version number, OK? Good.

      How do I unzip the downloaded
files?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     All of the files you've downloaded
     <strong>
      must
     </strong>
     be
unzipped to
     <strong>
      the same directory / folder
     </strong>
     . Unzipping
is done differently on different platforms (don't ya hate
that?).
    </p>
    <p>
     If you use
     <strong>
      Windows
     </strong>
     and you don't already have
it, you should download:
     <br/>
     <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">
      WinZip
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     After WinZip has been installed, double-click one of the files.
This will open the file in WinZip. On the menu-bar, click the
"Extract to..." button, and enter the location where you want to
have PCGen (Example:
     <code>c:\tools\pcgen</code>
     ). Make sure you
have the "Include Subfolders" option checked!! Then you do the same
thing for the other file. Make sure you extract to the same
directory as last time. You might be asked if WinZip should
overwrite the files already there. If so, you can safely choose
yes, (no _really_, you can honestly, I wouldn't lie to you.).
    </p>
    <p>
     In
     <strong>
      Mac OS X
     </strong>
     , double-clicking the files, will
make two different folders. Then it is simply (we FAQ authors
_love_ that word) a case of making a new folder somewhere
(preferably in the Applications folder) and moving all the
     <strong>
      contents
     </strong>
     of the other two folders into that.
     <strong>
      Do not move the entire folders.
     </strong>
     Only the
contents!
    </p>
    <p>
     In
     <strong>
      Linux/Unix
     </strong>
     Gzip will do the trick.
Unix/Linux users by there nature should know what they are doing by
now ;-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, as an alternative to the 3 above, you can download one of
the platform-specific installer-files. _Most_ of these will do all
the work for you if you just download them, and then double-click
on whatever came down.

      What do I need besides the zip-files to
get the program running?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Glad you asked, because for many of you the instructions failed
didn't they? Well here's why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Make sure that have the Java 2 v1.4.0 (1.3.1 will also work, but
1.4.0 vastly improves performance). Runtime environment (or the
SDK) installed on your machine. It's available from:
     <br/>
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Mac users should note that Apple does not, and will not, support
Java 2 v1.3.1 or greater for anything less than Mac OS X, so there,
ha-ha, go and spend more money!
    </p>
   </li>

    <p>
     <span class="underline">
      Will PCGen run on my machine?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     That depends. The one thing that decides if you can run PCGen or
not, is whether you have at least JAVA 1.3.1 installed. If you do,
the it should run. If not, it won't. It really is that simple.

     However, some might want to check here, so here is a small list
(If your configuration is not on this list, send me an e-mail at:

     This might be because your machine have a problem finding the
files PCGen refers to. There is no easy way to fix this (there
never is). There are machine-specific releases of PCGen available,
but unless you choose to use one of these, you'll have to manually
change the addressing in the files you're to access. Normally this
is a case of changing a
     <code>/</code>
     to a
     <code>\</code>
     or the
other way round. Also make sure that you don't try to access
something like
     <code>c:/program files/pcgen/</code>
     when you should
be accessing
     <code>c:/program~1/pcgen/</code>
     , or vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
     Note that on Windows, enclosing the entire path in double
quotation marks is an acceptable way to accessing the directory,
i.e.
     <code>"c:\program files\pcgen\"</code>
     . The same might also
work on Mac OS X, but I'm not a Mac user, so I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another reason might be the _ever_ popular "unzipping error".
You
     <strong>
      <span class="underline">
       must
      </span>
     </strong>
     keep the
structure intact, when you unzip the downloaded files. In other
words, be sure to unzip the files with the option enabled to create
the appropriate directory structure within the install
directory.
    </p>
    <p>
     In Windows this should be a breeze. But be aware of a small
pitfall with Mac OS X here. I've discovered that Mac OS X doesn't
simply overwrite the files within a specified directory, but in
fact overwrites the entire directory. What this means is that if
you do things in the "wrong" order some directories might be empty.
There are three ways to make sure this doesn't happen.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       One is to unzip the files into different directories, and then
move the individual files to their right position.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Another way is to use the terminal-window. Move the zip-files to
where you want them, and use the terminal-window to manually unzip
the files. The first two files, shouldn't be any problem just write
       <code>"unzip pcgenXXX_part1of3.zip"</code>
       , and watch the files
being unstuffed. Do the same for pcgenXXX_part2of3.zip BUT, when
you try this for pcgenXXX_part3of3.zip, you'll be asked a question.
Answer this by typing "
       <code>A</code>
       ". Wheee, look at it go!
Anyway, you should now have a file called pcgen.jar, which you can
double-click to start PCGen.
      </p>
     </li>

       Thirdly, you can use conor1014's excellent alternate PCGen
release. He normally releases a new version on Fridays. Look for it
at:
       <br/>
       <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/Misc/Alternate%20PCGen%20Releases/">
        http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/Misc/Alternate%20PCGen%20Releases/
       </a>
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <span class="underline">
     Why can't I make a new character? The
"New" menu-item is grayed out.
    </span>
    <p>
     This is probably the most asked question so far. The answer is
this: Before you can make a character, you must tell PCGen which
rule books it should use. In other words, you must load one or more
source books or modules listed under the "Source Material"-tab
before you can make a new character. Make sure that at least one
module is marked by a "Y" instead of a "N".
    </p>
    <p>
     You might wonder why PCGen doesn't do this automatically. This
is because PCGen is made to be a RPG-generator. As it stands now,
you may choose to load a Fantasy, Sci-Fi or Contempory module
instead. Had PCGen automatically loaded a module, you would have to
unload that module and then load another module, if you wanted to
make a Sci-Fi RPG-character.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are options to load sources on start up or as you open a
PC, take your pick, we don't mind ;-).
