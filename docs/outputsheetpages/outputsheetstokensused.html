  <h1>
   Character Output Sheet Creation
  </h1>
  <p>
   Creating output sheets of any kind is even more difficult than
list editing, and we won't explain the mechanics of HOW to create a
sheet here, only the tokens used by the sheets to get the desired
information from PCGen. Creating output sheets requires a little
knowledge of HTML or XML and some javascript/VB Script knowledge
doesn't hurt either!
  </p>
  <p>
   Whether you have this knowledge or not, it is
   <em>
    strongly
   </em>
   recommended that you take a look at how the current sheets are
constructed and 'borrow' bits and pieces from them to build your
own.
  </p>
  <p>
   Special acknowledgment goes out to Richard O'Doherty-Gregg
(oROGutang) for his outstanding output sheets and the basis that
all wanna-be sheet makers aspire to. If mimicry is the purest form
of flattery, then ROG has been flattered more than most, as almost
EVERY alternate sheet that is used within PCGen is some way derived
from his works!
  </p>
  <p>
   Thanks Richard!

   UPDATE!
  </p>
  <p>
   Now we have Barak to thank. He has been busily (and happily...
or else!) updating the character sheets and tokens as well as
writing up some tutorials on how to use the tokens in the sheets
(these are forthcoming). But the new formatting and explanations
used are really top notch! So kudos to Barak for all his hard
work.

   The entire output token documentation has revised and formatted
by Shane Molnar (LetohNereg) with content help from Barak.
