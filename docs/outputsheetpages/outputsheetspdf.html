<h1>
    Character Output Sheets: PDF Versions
</h1>
<h2>
    XSLT based PDF sheets
</h2>
<ul class="indent1">
    <li>
        XSLT sheets are xml XSL Transformations based, more dynamic
        versions of the .fo pdf sheets and have for the most part replaced
        them by now.
    </li>
    <li>
        They are dynamic in the way that if the character has a
        portrait it will be displayed. If there is no picture of the
        character, that section of the sheet is simply skipped.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a character is of an spellcasting class, its spells and
        spellbook will be listed.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the character is of an spellcasting class and has not yet
        received any spells, no spell progression page will be added
        (unlike the now deprecated .fo sheets).
    </li>
    <li>
        The sheet will include a bio page if there is some text
        contained in the bio field. Feat descriptions are included as in
        csheet_fantasy_descriptions.fo.
    </li>
    <li>
        The xslt intelligence is contained in the
        <a href="outputsheetbasexml.html">
            base.xml
        </a>
        file in the outputsheets
        root folder.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        csheet_fantasy_std_xxx.xslt
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This sheet comes in several different colors, determined by the
    xxx description and produces a 3+ page sheet styled after the
    csheet_fantasy_std.htm sheet.
    <br/>
    It will display all possible variations of wielding each
    weapon.
</p>
<ul class="indent1">
    <li>
        1 - Primary hand
    </li>
    <li>
        2 - Off hand
    </li>
    <li>
        3 - Two handed
    </li>
    <li>
        4 - Two Weapon Fighting Primary Hand (off hand weapon
        light)
    </li>
    <li>
        5 - Two Weapon Fighting Primary Hand (off hand weapon
        heavy)
    </li>
    <li>
        6 - Two Weapon Fighting Off hand
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        csheet_fantasy_simple_xxx.xslt
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This sheet also comes in several different colors, determined by
    the xxx description.
    <br/>
    It is the same as the std sheet apart from the fact that for melee
    weapons the simple sheet only shows the primary hand attack.
    <br/>
    The simple sheet is used for characters who only fight with a
    single weapon in their on-hand and do not need the other 5
    variations.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        csheet_modern_std.xslt
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Same as the fantasy sheet, only for the d20 Modern gamemode
    (Modern).
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        csheet_fantasy_spellbook_xxx.xsl
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    These templates are used to export the spells the character
    knows or has access to, to a nicely formatted spell list. The
    different templates offer several different layouts.
</p>
<h2>
    .fo based PDF sheets
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
    <strong>
        csheet_fantasy_Spellbook.fo
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Produces a combined spell book for the character
    listing all spells (regardless of class or level) in alphabetical
    order with their details.
