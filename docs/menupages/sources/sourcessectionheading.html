<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Sources
    </strong>
    menu is used to select, load,
    reload, and unload data sets within PCGen for the use of the user.
    The menu options are as follows:
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Select Sources
    </strong>
    command will call up the
    <a href="sourcesselectionoptions.html">
        <strong>
            Select
            Sources
        </strong>
    </a>
    window where you can select and load data sets
    from the large collection of data sets distributed by PCGen.

</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Load Sources
    </strong>
    command presents a list of
    standard pre-configured sets. These sets consist of the
    following:
    <br/>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        MSRD
    </li>
    <li>
        Pathfinder RPG for Game Masters (includes Monsters)
    </li>
    <li>
        Pathfinder RPG for Players
    </li>
    <li>
        Pathfinder for Players - Advanced
    </li>
    <li>
        SRD 3.0 for Players
    </li>
    <li>
        SRD 3.5 for Game Masters (includes Monsters)
    </li>
    <li>
        SRD 3.5 for Players
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can add your own custom configurations to this list through
    the
    <a href="sourcesselectionoptions.html#savecustom">
        Select
        Sources
    </a>
    window.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Reload Sources
    </strong>
    command will reload the
    current sources.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Unload Sources
    </strong>
    comman unloads the current
    sources.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    The
    <a href="sourcesinstalldataoptions.html">
        <strong>
            Install
            Data
        </strong>
    </a>
    command allows the installation of data sets
    completed and distributed by the PCGen team as Out-of-Cycle (OOC)
    data sets. This is also particularly useful for GMs who have
    created their own campaign files as it simplifies the process of
    sharing the sets with their players.
