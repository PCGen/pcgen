</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Base Tab
    </strong>
    has everything required to make a
    simple Template.  The remaining tabs are for more advanced
    Template creation. The Templates created will be saved into the
    data/custom directory under the name of customTemplates.lst.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Template Name
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the
    name for your Template.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Visible
    </strong>
    option determines whether the
    template name is hidden in PCGen &amp; or the character sheet
    output. The options are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Yes
        </strong>
        - Shows the Template name in PCGen and on
        export to a character sheet (This is the default setting)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            No
        </strong>
        - Hides the Template name in PCGen and on
        export to a character sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Display
        </strong>
        - Displays the Template name in PCGen
        but not on the character sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Export
        </strong>
        - Hides the Template name from PCGen
        but displays it on the character sheet.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Removable
    </strong>
    flag determines whether a
    character can remove a template once it has been selected by a
    character.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Gender Locked
    </strong>
    option sets the character's
    Gender and disables the ability to change it.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Wpn Non Prof Penalty
    </strong>
    is used to set the
    character's penalty for non proficiency in a weapon to the
    specified numeric value. This can only be a negative number or
    zero
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Bonus Skill Points / Level
    </strong>
    is where you
    will enter additional skill points that your Template receives with
    each level increase. This happens before multiplication of the
    first class level's skill points.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Bonus Starting Feats
    </strong>
    is where you will
    enter additional feats that your Template receives at
    1
    <sup>
        st
    </sup>
    level. These are unrestricted feats.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        CR
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the starting
    Challenge Rating of your Template. For CR's less than 1, fractions
    are used (1/2, 1/4, 3/4).
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Level Adjustment
    </strong>
    is where you will enter
    the Effective Character Level (ECL) of the Template.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Size
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the size class
    of your Template. Size is used in determining TO-HIT, AC, and
    affects some skills.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Sub Race
    </strong>
    option sets the name of the sub
    race the character is , the default is none. If Yes is
    <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
    specified
   </span>
    then it
    will place the name of the template in parenthesis after the race
    on character sheet output.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Sub Region
    </strong>
    option sets the name of the
    region the character is from, the default is none. If Yes is
    <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;">
    specified
   </span>
    then it will place the name of the template in parenthesis after
    the race on character sheet output.
</p>
<p>
    The two
    <strong>
        Type
    </strong>
    windows,
    <strong>
        Available
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Selected
    </strong>
    are used
    to create a list of types which the template is part of.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
            Remove
        </strong>
        buttons
        will move the highlighted type between the 2 windows, as will
        double clicking on a type name.
    </li>
    <li>
        New types can be added by manually typing them and then
        clicking the
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        button
    </li>
    <li>
        Important for matching up with Monster HD, and for references
        to race, such as the Rangers Favored Enemy.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Source
    </strong>
    field is a text window for listing
    what source material the Template is from.  If it is a custom
    created Template, then you can leave this blank or simply put in
    "custom"
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Product Identity
    </strong>
    checkbox is to denote if
    the Template's name being created is the Product Identity of a
    publisher
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cancel
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    buttons,
    which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the Template
    creation or save it to the customTemplates.lst file.
