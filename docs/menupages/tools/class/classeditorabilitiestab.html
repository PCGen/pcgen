  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Abilities Tab
   </strong>
   is used to add additional
abilities for the Class being created.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Attack Cycle
   </strong>
   is the rate of which the class
gains extra attacks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Hit Die
   </strong>
   is the Hit Die used to determine
hit points at each level gained
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Max Level
   </strong>
   is the maximum level a character
in this class can advance to.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Bonus Feats
   </strong>
   is used to determine how many
extra feats the class will get at first level only.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Levels Per Feat
   </strong>
   is the number of levels it
takes for a monster to gain a new feat
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Item Create Mult
   </strong>
   is the numeric value
supplied that will be multiplied with the class level of the
character for calculating potions, scrolls, and wands. (The default
value is 1.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Spell Type
   </strong>
   is the type of spells the
character casts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Spell Stat
   </strong>
   is used to tell PCGen what
attribute/stat to use for determining bonus spells and maximum
level the character can cast
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Cast As
   </strong>
   field tells PCGen to use the
referenced class's progressions. E.g. Cleric
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Uses Spell Book
   </strong>
   flag indicates that the
class is required to use a spellbook as a wizard does.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Memorizes Spells
   </strong>
   flag indicates that the
class is required to memorize spells as a wizard does.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Prohibited
   </strong>
   field is a comma delimited list
of spell schools that are prohibited to the class (no spells from
that school can be taken)
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Specialty Known
   </strong>
   field tells PCGen to add
the numeric value given to the number of specialty school spells
know by the spell caster, if not listed, the default value is 0
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Spell List
   </strong>
   field gives the class the
ability to cast the spells listed in this field.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Known Spells
   </strong>
   field is used to automatically
give spells, by name or level, to the spell caster. All spells
granted by name or level will be given as long as the spell caster
has a high enough prerequisite attribute score. The main entries
are pipe delimited, and if an entry contains a comma delimited
list, all the entries in the comma delimited list must be met.
LEVEL=3,TYPE=Custom would be met only for level 3 spells which had
Custom in its TYPE: string.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Cancel
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   buttons,
which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the Class
creation or save it to the customClasses.lst file.
