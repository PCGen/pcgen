</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Abilities Tab
    </strong>
    is used to add additional
    abilities for the Class being created.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Attack Cycle
    </strong>
    is the rate of which the class
    gains extra attacks.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Hit Die
    </strong>
    is the Hit Die used to determine
    hit points at each level gained
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Max Level
    </strong>
    is the maximum level a character
    in this class can advance to.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Bonus Feats
    </strong>
    is used to determine how many
    extra feats the class will get at first level only.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Levels Per Feat
    </strong>
    is the number of levels it
    takes for a monster to gain a new feat
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Item Create Mult
    </strong>
    is the numeric value
    supplied that will be multiplied with the class level of the
    character for calculating potions, scrolls, and wands. (The default
    value is 1.)
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Spell Type
    </strong>
    is the type of spells the
    character casts.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Spell Stat
    </strong>
    is used to tell PCGen what
    attribute/stat to use for determining bonus spells and maximum
    level the character can cast
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cast As
    </strong>
    field tells PCGen to use the
    referenced class's progressions. E.g. Cleric
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Uses Spell Book
    </strong>
    flag indicates that the
    class is required to use a spellbook as a wizard does.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Memorizes Spells
    </strong>
    flag indicates that the
    class is required to memorize spells as a wizard does.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Prohibited
    </strong>
    field is a comma delimited list
    of spell schools that are prohibited to the class (no spells from
    that school can be taken)
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Specialty Known
    </strong>
    field tells PCGen to add
    the numeric value given to the number of specialty school spells
    know by the spell caster, if not listed, the default value is 0
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Spell List
    </strong>
    field gives the class the
    ability to cast the spells listed in this field.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Known Spells
    </strong>
    field is used to automatically
    give spells, by name or level, to the spell caster. All spells
    granted by name or level will be given as long as the spell caster
    has a high enough prerequisite attribute score. The main entries
    are pipe delimited, and if an entry contains a comma delimited
    list, all the entries in the comma delimited list must be met.
    LEVEL=3,TYPE=Custom would be met only for level 3 spells which had
    Custom in its TYPE: string.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cancel
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    buttons,
    which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the Class
    creation or save it to the customClasses.lst file.
