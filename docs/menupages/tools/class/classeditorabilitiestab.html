		<p>The <strong>Abilities Tab</strong> is used to add additional abilities for the Class being created.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Attack Cycle</strong> is the rate of which the class gains extra attacks.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Hit Die</strong> is the Hit Die used to determine hit points at each level
		gained</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Max Level</strong> is the maximum level a character in this class can advance
		to.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Bonus Feats</strong> is used to determine how many extra feats the class will
		get at first level only.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Levels Per Feat</strong> is the number of levels it takes for a monster to
		gain a new feat</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Item Create Mult</strong> is the numeric value supplied that will be multiplied
		with the class level of the character for calculating potions, scrolls, and
		wands. (The default value is 1.)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Spell Type</strong> is the type of spells the character casts.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Spell Stat</strong> is used to tell PCGen what attribute/stat to use for
		determining bonus spells and maximum level the character can cast</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cast As </strong>field tells PCGen to use the referenced class's
		progressions. E.g. Cleric</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Uses Spell Book</strong> flag indicates that the class is required to use a spellbook
		as a wizard does.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Memorizes Spells</strong> flag indicates that the class is required to
		memorize spells as a wizard does.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Prohibited</strong> field is a comma delimited list of spell schools that are
		prohibited to the class (no spells from that school can be taken)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Specialty Known</strong> field tells PCGen to add the numeric value given to
		the number of specialty school spells know by the spell caster, if not listed,
		the default value is 0</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Spell List</strong> field gives the class the ability to cast the spells
		listed in this field.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Known Spells</strong> field is used to automatically give spells, by name or
		level, to the spell caster. All spells granted by name or level will be given
		as long as the spell caster has a high enough prerequisite attribute score. The
		main entries are pipe delimited, and if an entry contains a comma delimited
		list, all the entries in the comma delimited list must be met. LEVEL=3,TYPE=Custom
		would be met only for level 3 spells which had Custom in its TYPE: string.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cancel</strong> and <strong>Save </strong>buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
		to either cancel the Class creation or save it to the customClasses.lst file.</p>
