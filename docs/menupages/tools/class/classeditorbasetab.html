</p>
<p>
    The Class Editor is to used to create/edit your own Classes.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Base Tab
    </strong>
    has everything required to make a
    simple Class. The remaining tabs are for more advanced Class
    creation. The Classes created will be saved into the data/custom
    directory under the name of customClasses.lst.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Class Name
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the name
    that you want to print.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Display Name
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the
    name that you want displayed in PCGen.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        ABB
    </strong>
    is a 3-5 letter abbreviation of the
    class name.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Ex-Class
    </strong>
    is the class to which all current
    class levels are converted if the class prerequisites are no longer
    met.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Exchange Level
    </strong>
    allows the exchange of
    levels from the current class to the specified class.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Has SubClass
    </strong>
    flag indicates whether or not
    this class can choose a specialty or subclass.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Mod To Skills
    </strong>
    flag indicates monster types
    that do not get their Intelligence modifiers for skills they get
    from gaining hit dice.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Starting Skill Points
    </strong>
    is how many skill
    points a character gains per level.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Qualify
    </strong>
    field is a text description that is
    usually "alwaysValid". It can list exceptions to perquisites.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Multi-Class Pre-Reqs
    </strong>
    flag is selected when
    all Pre-Requisites are valid only if the character would be
    multi-classing into that class (i.e. there are no pre-reqs for
    choosing this as the first class).
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Visible
    </strong>
    is a flag that determine whether
    the class is hidden or not.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Specials
    </strong>
    is a | (pipe) and , (comma)
    delimited tag that is used to tell PCGen what special ability the
    class gets, (Uncanny Dodge|Rogue) the level adjustment of the
    ability ( |0| ) and finally, what levels the class gets the special
    ability at (2,6,11,14,17,20).
</p>
<p>
    The two
    <strong>
        Type
    </strong>
    windows,
    <strong>
        Available
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Selected
    </strong>
    are used
    to create a list of types that the Class is a member of.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
            Remove
        </strong>
        buttons
        will move the highlighted language between the 2 windows, as will
        double clicking on a Type name.
    </li>
    <li>
        New Types can be added by manually typing them and then
        clicking the
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        button
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Source
    </strong>
    field is a text window for listing
    what source material the Class is from. (If it is a custom created
    Class, then you can leave this blank or simply put in "custom")
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Product Identity
    </strong>
    checkbox is to denote if
    the Class's name being created is the Product Identity of a
    publisher
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cancel
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    buttons,
    which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the Class
    creation or save it to the customClasses.lst file.
