  <p>
   The Class Editor is to used to create/edit your own Classes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Base Tab
   </strong>
   has everything required to make a
simple Class. The remaining tabs are for more advanced Class
creation. The Classes created will be saved into the data/custom
directory under the name of customClasses.lst.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Class Name
   </strong>
   is where you will enter the name
that you want to print.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Display Name
   </strong>
   is where you will enter the
name that you want displayed in PCGen.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    ABB
   </strong>
   is a 3-5 letter abbreviation of the
class name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Ex-Class
   </strong>
   is the class to which all current
class levels are converted if the class prerequisites are no longer
met.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Exchange Level
   </strong>
   allows the exchange of
levels from the current class to the specified class.
  </p>
  <p>

   <strong>
    Has SubClass
   </strong>
   flag indicates whether or not
this class can choose a specialty or subclass.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Mod To Skills
   </strong>
   flag indicates monster types
that do not get their Intelligence modifiers for skills they get
from gaining hit dice.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Starting Skill Points
   </strong>

points a character gains per level.
  </p>
  <p>

   <strong>

usually "alwaysValid". It can list exceptions to perquisites.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Multi-Class Pre-Reqs
   </strong>
   flag is selected when
all Pre-Requisites are valid only if the character would be
multi-classing into that class (i.e. there are no pre-reqs for
choosing this as the first class).
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Visible
   </strong>
   is a flag that determine whether
the class is hidden or not.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Specials
   </strong>
   is a | (pipe) and , (comma)
delimited tag that is used to tell PCGen what special ability the
class gets, (Uncanny Dodge|Rogue) the level adjustment of the
ability ( |0| ) and finally, what levels the class gets the special
ability at (2,6,11,14,17,20).
  </p>
  <p>
   The two
   <strong>
    Type
   </strong>
   windows,
   <strong>
    Available
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Selected
   </strong>
   are used
to create a list of types that the Class is a member of.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Add
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     Remove
    </strong>
    buttons
will move the highlighted language between the 2 windows, as will
double clicking on a Type name.
   </li>
   <li>
    New Types can be added by manually typing them and then
clicking the
    <strong>
     Add
    </strong>
    button
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Source
   </strong>
   field is a text window for listing
what source material the Class is from. (If it is a custom created
Class, then you can leave this blank or simply put in "custom")
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Product Identity
   </strong>
   checkbox is to denote if
the Class's name being created is the Product Identity of a
publisher
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Cancel
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   buttons,
which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the Class
creation or save it to the customClasses.lst file.
