</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Base Tab
    </strong>
    has everything required to make a
    simple Class.  The remaining tabs are for more advanced Class
    creation. The Classes created will be saved into the data/custom
    directory under the name of customClasses.lst.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Deity Name
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the name
    for your deity.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Holy Item
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the
    name/description of the holy item for the deity.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Deities Alignment
    </strong>
    drop down menu is for
    selecting the deity alignment.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Description
    </strong>
    window is where you will type
    in a description of the deity (i.e. "God of the Dawn")
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Deity's Favored Weapons
    </strong>
    windows,
    <strong>
        Available
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Selected
    </strong>
    are used
    to create a list of all the favored weapons, primarily for use with
    the War domain.
</p>
<p>
    The weapon names in the
    <strong>
        Available
    </strong>
    window are
    drawn from whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you
    have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then weapon names
    from both sources will appear in the window.)
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Add
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Remove
    </strong>
    buttons
    will move the highlighted weapon between the 2 windows, as will
    double clicking on a weapon name.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Source
    </strong>
    window, is a text window for listing
    what source material the deity is from. If it is a custom created
    deity, then you can leave this blank or simply put in "custom"
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Product Identity
    </strong>
    checkbox is to denote if
    the deity's name being created is the Product Identity of a
    publisher
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cancel
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    buttons,
    which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the deity
    creation or save it to the customdeities.lst file.
