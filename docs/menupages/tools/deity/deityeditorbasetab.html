The Classes created		will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of customClasses.lst.</p>				<p>The <strong>Deity Name</strong> is where you will enter the name for your deity.</p>				<p>The <strong>Holy Item</strong> is where you will enter the name/description of the holy item for the deity.</p>				<p>The <strong>Deities Alignment</strong> drop down menu is for selecting the deity alignment.</p>				<p>The <strong>Description</strong> window is where you will type in a description of the deity (i.e. &quot;God of the Dawn&quot;)</p>				<p>The <strong>Deity's Favored Weapons</strong> windows, <strong>Available</strong> and <strong>Selected</strong> are used to create a list of all the 		favored weapons, primarily for use with the War domain. </p>				<p>The weapon names in the <strong>Available</strong> window are drawn from whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you 		have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then weapon names from both sources will appear in the window.)</p>				<p>The <strong>Add</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons will move the highlighted weapon between the 2 windows, as will double 		clicking on a weapon name.</p>				<p>The <strong>Source</strong> window, is a text window for listing what source material the deity is from.
