  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Races Tab
   </strong>
   is used to define the specific
race which worships the deity, if appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The two
   <strong>
    Racial Worshippers
   </strong>
   windows,
   <strong>
    Available
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Selected
   </strong>
   are used
to create a list of races which follow the deity.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The race names in the
    <strong>
     Available
    </strong>
    window are
drawn from whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you
have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then races from
both sources will appear in the window.)
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Add
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     Remove
    </strong>
    buttons
will move the highlighted race name between the 2 windows, as will
double clicking on a race name.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Cancel
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   buttons,
which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the deity
creation or save it to the customdeities.lst file.
