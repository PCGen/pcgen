<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Races Tab
    </strong>
    is used to define the specific
    race which worships the deity, if appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    The two
    <strong>
        Racial Worshippers
    </strong>
    windows,
    <strong>
        Available
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Selected
    </strong>
    are used
    to create a list of races which follow the deity.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The race names in the
        <strong>
            Available
        </strong>
        window are
        drawn from whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you
        have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then races from
        both sources will appear in the window.)
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
            Remove
        </strong>
        buttons
        will move the highlighted race name between the 2 windows, as will
        double clicking on a race name.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cancel
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    buttons,
    which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the deity
    creation or save it to the customdeities.lst file.
