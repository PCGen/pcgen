		<p>The Deity Editor is to create you own Deities, edit ones you have already made,
		and in the future will allow you to edit existing Deities (from other data/list
		files).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>New</strong> button will allow the creation of a new Deity.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Edit</strong> button will allow you to edit the selected Deity (Deities
		created within this Deity Editor only at this stage).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Delete</strong> button will remove the selected Deity&nbsp; (Deities
		created within this Deity Editor only at this stage).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Copy</strong> button makes a copy of a selected Deity. In this way you can
		slightly modify an existing Deity and give it a new name.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Close</strong> button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.</p>
		
		<p>Deities added will be saved into the customDeities.lst file.</p>
