    hands your race has. It determines the Number of Hands the creature

</p>
<p>
    The

    the 1
    <sup>
        st

    the comma delimited list is the highest HD the creature can advance
    to, through HD advancement. All the numbers preceding the last
    number each indicate the highest number of HD the creature can have
    before its size increases by one category. (Example: Assassin Vine:
    starts out as Large, with 4 HD. 5-16 it is Huge, 17-32 it is
    Gargantuan, 33+ it is Colossal. 99 HD is the maximum it can ever
    raise to so it's HD advancement would be 4,16,32,99)
