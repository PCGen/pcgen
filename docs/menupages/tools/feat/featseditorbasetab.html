  <h1>
   Feat Editor: Base Tab
  </h1>
  <p class="center">

  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Base Tab
   </strong>
   has everything required to make a
simple Feat.  The remaining tabs are for more advanced Feat
creation.  The Feats created will be saved into the
data/custom directory under the name of customFeats.lst.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Feat Name
   </strong>
   is where you will enter the name
for your Feat.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Desc Product Identity
   </strong>
   is used to show that
the Description field is closed content. Permission must be gained
from the publisher to release it into official files.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Description
   </strong>
   is the short description of the
feat from the source material. If that one line is not OGC, then
the
   <strong>
    Desc Product Identity
   </strong>
   should be selected.
  </p>
  <p>
   The two
   <strong>
    Type
   </strong>
   windows,
   <strong>
    Available
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Selected
   </strong>
   are used
to create a list of languages which the Feat grants.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     Add
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     Remove
    </strong>
    buttons
will move the highlighted language between the 2 windows, as will
double clicking on a Type name.
   </li>
   <li>
    New Types can be added by manually typing them and then
clicking the
    <strong>
     Add
    </strong>
    button
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Cost
   </strong>
   is how many feat points the feat
costs. A decimal value such as 0.5 would mean that it only costs
1/2 a feat point.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Visible
   </strong>
   is where you will indicate whether
and how you want the feat name to appear and print. The options are
outlined below:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Yes
    </strong>
    - Shows the feat name in PCGen and on
export to a character sheet
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     No
    </strong>
    - Hides the feat name in PCGen and on
export to a character sheet.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Display
    </strong>
    - Displays the feat name in PCGen but
not on the character sheet.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Export
    </strong>
    - Hides the feat name from PCGen but
displays it on the character sheet.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Multiples Allowed
   </strong>
   is used to determine if a
feat can be taken multiple times.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Stacks
   </strong>
   is used to determine if the feat
benefits may be stacked on one another.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Spell Level
   </strong>
   is where you will enter the
additional levels added to spells that use the Feat. Eg Empower
Spell uses a spell slot two levels higher so 2 is entered in this
field.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Source
   </strong>
   field is a text window for listing
what source material the Feat is from.  If it is a custom
created Feat, then you can leave this blank or simply put in
"custom"
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Product Identity
   </strong>
   checkbox is to denote if
the Feat's name being created is the Product Identity of a
publisher
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Cancel
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   buttons,
which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the Feat
creation or save it to the customFeats.lst file.
