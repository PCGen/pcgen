</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Base Tab
    </strong>
    has everything required to make a
    simple Feat.  The remaining tabs are for more advanced Feat
    creation.  The Feats created will be saved into the
    data/custom directory under the name of customFeats.lst.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Feat Name
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the name
    for your Feat.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Desc Product Identity
    </strong>
    is used to show that
    the Description field is closed content. Permission must be gained
    from the publisher to release it into official files.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Description
    </strong>
    is the short description of the
    feat from the source material. If that one line is not OGC, then
    the
    <strong>
        Desc Product Identity
    </strong>
    should be selected.
</p>
<p>
    The two
    <strong>
        Type
    </strong>
    windows,
    <strong>
        Available
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Selected
    </strong>
    are used
    to create a list of languages which the Feat grants.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
            Remove
        </strong>
        buttons
        will move the highlighted language between the 2 windows, as will
        double clicking on a Type name.
    </li>
    <li>
        New Types can be added by manually typing them and then
        clicking the
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        button
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cost
    </strong>
    is how many feat points the feat
    costs. A decimal value such as 0.5 would mean that it only costs
    1/2 a feat point.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Visible
    </strong>
    is where you will indicate whether
    and how you want the feat name to appear and print. The options are
    outlined below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Yes
        </strong>
        - Shows the feat name in PCGen and on
        export to a character sheet
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            No
        </strong>
        - Hides the feat name in PCGen and on
        export to a character sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Display
        </strong>
        - Displays the feat name in PCGen but
        not on the character sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Export
        </strong>
        - Hides the feat name from PCGen but
        displays it on the character sheet.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Multiples Allowed
    </strong>
    is used to determine if a
    feat can be taken multiple times.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Stacks
    </strong>
    is used to determine if the feat
    benefits may be stacked on one another.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Spell Level
    </strong>
    is where you will enter the
    additional levels added to spells that use the Feat. Eg Empower
    Spell uses a spell slot two levels higher so 2 is entered in this
    field.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Source
    </strong>
    field is a text window for listing
    what source material the Feat is from.  If it is a custom
    created Feat, then you can leave this blank or simply put in
    "custom"
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Product Identity
    </strong>
    checkbox is to denote if
    the Feat's name being created is the Product Identity of a
    publisher
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cancel
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    buttons,
    which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the Feat
    creation or save it to the customFeats.lst file.
