Its main purpose to to keep custom LST files created   		in previous versions current by updating them to the current code. Its functions   		are limited and will not fix bugs or convert really old files to the current   		version. You cannot, for example, convert files from PCGen 2.x to the current   		version nor can you use it to adjust for different gameModes. The best method   		for using the LST converter on files from version older then one prior version   		is to run the LST Converter in each version on the dataset successively until   		you reach the current version.</p>		<p>To run the LST Converter on a dataset choose LST Converter from the Tools menu   		and then select the directory in which the dataset resides. You will be presented   		with a window listing the files and tags to be updated. You may choose which   		files and tags you wish to convert and then run the converter.</p>	</body></html>
