    The
    <strong>
        Lst Converter
    </strong>
    is meant to aid anyone who
    creates their own custom list files. Its main purpose to keep
    custom LST files created in previous versions current by updating
    them to the current code. Its functions are limited and will not
    fix bugs or convert really old files to the current version. You
    cannot, for example, convert files from PCGen 2.x to the current
    version nor can you use it to adjust for different gameModes. The
    best method for using the LST converter on files from version older
    then one prior version is to run the LST Converter in each version
    on the dataset successively until you reach the current
    version.
</p>
<p>
    To run the LST Converter on a dataset choose LST Converter from
    the Tools menu and then select the directory in which the dataset
    resides. You will be presented with a window listing the files and
    tags to be updated. You may choose which files and tags you wish to
    convert and then run the converter.
