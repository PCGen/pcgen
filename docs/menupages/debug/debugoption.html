		<p class="indent0">The <strong>Debug</strong> menu allows the user to start PCGen's self debugging mode. 
		This allows the logging of problems and a display of what is &quot;going on&quot; within the program. This 
		functionality aids the PCGen team in solving problems associated with any errors or messages that occur 
		when running the program. There are three available options: <strong>Debug Mode</strong>, <strong>Logging 
		Level</strong> and <strong>Console</strong>.</p>
		
		<p class="indent0">The <strong>Debug Mode</strong> turns on the logging functionality of PCGen and saves every 
		message, every loading and unloading of files, every key stroke and option made. This is useful for tracing down 
		the exact time and place an issue has occurred. For instance, if the user was having a problem running a loaded 
		source and PCGen was opening new windows and presenting an error, the Debug program would record where there were 
		faults within the file. Doing so allows the user to pinpoint where in the file an error has occurred instead 
		of hunting through the file to find the problem. (Note this is a selectable option - you have only to select 
		this once and it remains on. The debuger decreases performance when enabled).</p>
		
		<p class="indent0">The <strong>Logging Level</strong> sets the level of detail logged by PCGen's debugging mode.
		The different levels of logging, and the types of problems they list, are as follows:</p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>Error -</strong> All exceptions</p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>LST Error -</strong> LST error output, e.g. where a token syntax is incorrect, plus all 
			exceptions.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>Warnings -</strong> Alerts on things that might have an impact on the current session plus 
			LST Errors and exceptions.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>LST Warnings -</strong> Deprecated syntax use and other warnings on LST code plus alerts, 
			LST errors and exceptions.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>LST Info -</strong> LST information such as references to missing items in PRE or CHOOSE tags
			plus LST warnings and errors, alerts and exceptions.</p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>Debug -</strong> Code tracing info plus all other previously covered problems.</p>
		<p></ p>
		
<p class="center"><img  src="../../images/windows/debugconsole.png" alt="Debug Console Window" width="576" height="432" /></p>
		
		<p class="indent0">The <strong>Console</strong> option opens up a new &quot;Console&quot; window. This window 
		lists any warnings the user has received since starting PCGen - it also lists all system environment variables 
		that PCGen cares about. If you're having trouble running PCGen, or a campaign doesn't seem to be loading properly, 
		this is the first place to check. We ask that all bug reports include a copy of the console contents since this 
		can provide us with invaluable information.</p>
