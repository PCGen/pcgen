This allows for a logging 		of problems and a display of what is &quot;going on&quot; within the PCGen program. This functionality aids 		the PCGen team in helping to solve problems associated with any errors or messages that occur when running 		the program. The two options are: <strong>Debug Mode&nbsp;</strong> and <strong>Console</strong></p>				<p>The <strong>Debug Mode</strong> turns on the logging functionality of PCGen and saves every message, every loading 		and loading of files, every key stroke and option made. This is useful for tracing down the exact time and 		place an issue has occurred.&nbsp; For instance, if the user was having a problem running a loaded source 		and PCGen was opening new windows and presenting an error, the Debug program would record where there were 		faults within the file. Doing so allows the user to pinpoint where in the file an error has occurred instead 		of hunting through the file to find the problem. (Note this is a selectable option - you have only to select 		this once and it remains on. This does decrease performance when enabled).</p>				<p class="center"><img  src="../../images/windows/debugconsole.png" alt="Debug Console Window" width="576" height="432" /></p>				<p>The <strong>Console</strong> option opens up a new window. This window lists any warnings the user has received 		since starting PCGen - it also lists all system environment variables that PCGen cares about.  If you're 		having trouble running PCGen, or a campaign doesn't seem to be loading properly, this is the first place 		to check. We ask that all bug reports include a copy of the Debug tab contents if at all possible since 		this can provide us with invaluable information.</p>				<!-- <p class="cvsfooter">$Source: /cvsroot/pcgendocs/pcgendocs/docs/menupages/debug/debugoption.html,v $ ($Revision: 1.2 $) last updated $Date: 2004/04/03 02:44:42 $ by $Author: eddyanthony $</p> -->	</body></html>
