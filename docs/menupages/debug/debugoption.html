    The
    <strong>
        Debug
    </strong>
    menu allows the user
    to start PCGen's self debugging mode. This allows the logging of
    problems and a display of what is "going on" within the program.
    This functionality aids the PCGen team in solving problems
    associated with any errors or messages that occur when running the
    program. There are three available options:
    <strong>
        Debug
        Mode
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
        Logging Level
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Console
    </strong>
    .
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <strong>
        Debug Mode
    </strong>
    turns on PCGen's
    logging functionality, setting the logging per the
    <strong>
        Logging
        Level
    </strong>
    command below and turning on an audible alert when
    error output occurs. Every message is saved at loading and
    unloading of files, every key stroke and as each option made. This
    is useful for tracing down the exact time and place an issue has
    occurred. For instance, if the user was having a problem running a
    loaded source and PCGen was opening new windows and presenting an
    error, the Debug program would record where there were faults
    within the file. Doing so allows the user to pinpoint where in the
    file an error has occurred instead of hunting through the file to
    find the problem. (Note this is a selectable option - you have only
    to select this once and it remains on. The debugger decreases
    performance when enabled).

    The
    <strong>
        Logging Level
    </strong>
    sets the
    level of detail logged by PCGen's debugging mode. The different
    levels of logging, and the types of problems they list, are as
    follows:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Error -
    </strong>
    All exceptions
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Data Error -
    </strong>
    LST error output,
    e.g. where a token syntax is incorrect, plus all exceptions.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Warnings -
    </strong>
    Alerts on things
    that might have an impact on the current session plus data Errors
    and exceptions.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Data Warnings -
    </strong>
    Deprecated
    syntax use and other warnings on LST code plus alerts, data errors
    and exceptions.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Data Info -
    </strong>
    LST information
    such as references to missing items in PRE or CHOOSE tags plus data
    warnings and errors, alerts and exceptions.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Debug -
    </strong>
    Code tracing info plus
    all other previously covered problems.
</p>
<p>
    Changing the logging level through this sub-menu will only
    effect the logging level for the current PCGen session. To make a
    persistent change you need to modify the
    <em>
        logging.properties
    </em>
    file in the pcgen directory. The file
    has lots of entries, but the last few lines control the default
    logging level. The names used are slightly different in the file,
    but there are comments in the file on what names should be
    used.

<p class="center">

</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The
    <strong>
        Console
    </strong>
    option opens up a
    new "Console" window. This window displays any logging output, as
    determined by logging level command shown above, made since the
    console was opened. It also lists all system environment variables
    that PCGen cares about. If you're having trouble running PCGen, or
    a campaign doesn't seem to be loading properly, this is the first
    place to check. We ask that all bug reports include a copy of the
    console contents since this can provide us with invaluable
    information.
