  <h1>
   NPC Generator Data Files
  </h1>
  <p class="indent1">
   The NPC generator uses XML formated data to
establish the character options, class data, and treasure data. The
data files are located in the
   <em>
    system/npcgen.options
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    system/npcgen/classdata
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    system/npcgen/treasure
   </em>
   folders respectively. Though the
data files that are used to support NPCGen may be modified by the
user, requireing a familiarity with XML, they were not designed to
be extensible as the LST file structure and tags were.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Class Data Files
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   The data-structure of the "class data" is
defined in the file named
   <em>
    classdata.xsd
   </em>
   while the actual
data is contained in the file named
   <em>
    classdata.xml
   </em>
   . Each
gameMode will have its own XML file to establish its own class
data, though all gameModes will use the same data-structure.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Options Data Files
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   The data-structure of the character "options" is
defined in the file named
   <em>
    options.xsd
   </em>
   while the actual
data is contained in the file named
   <em>
    optionsdata.xml
   </em>
   . Each
gameMode will have its own XML file to establish its own character
options, though all gameModes will use the same data-structure.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Treasure Data Files
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   The data-structure of the "treasure" data is
defined in the file named
   <em>
    treasure.xsd
   </em>
   while the actual
data is contained in the file named
   <em>
    treasure.xml
   </em>
   . Each
gameMode will have its own XML file to establish its own treasure
data, though all gameModes will use the same data-structure.
