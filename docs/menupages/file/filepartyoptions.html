		<p>The <strong>Party</strong> command
		opens up a new set of options for the user to use. This is done mainly to help
		streamline the different commands a user has to remember in how to use PCGen.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Open Party</strong> option
		opens up a party file from the last used saved folder. The file extension will
		be a .PCP file that the user will select to load the party.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Close Party</strong> option closes the party files.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save Party</strong> option saves the party to
		the folder selected and asks for a name the first time. After the first time
		used it will use the previously saved name by default.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save Party As</strong> option allows the user to save 
		the party file as a different name than previously used. This is useful for having separate 
		parties and separate PC's and NPC's in different groups.</p>

		<p>The most recently closed or saved parties can be loaded from this menu.</p>
