<h1>
    Party Options
</h1>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Party
    </strong>
    command provides a number of options
    that make managing groups of PCs easier.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Party Options" src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_party.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Party
    </strong>
    command opens up a new set of options
    for the user to use.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Opening a Party" src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partyopen.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Open Party
    </strong>
    option opens a party file from
    the last folder PCgen used to save a file in. The
    <strong>
        Open
    </strong>
    window will pop up and the user can select
    the desired
    <strong>
        Party
    </strong>
    file and click
    <strong>
        Open
    </strong>
    . Party files use the
    <span class=':lstfile"'>
    .pcp
   </span>
    file extension..
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Close Party
    </strong>
    option closes the party files,
    saving and unloading all PCs currently loaded.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Saving a Party" src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partysave.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Save Party
    </strong>
    option allows the user to save
    all the PCs currently loaded as a "party". The
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    window will pop up and prompt the user for
    the party name. Enter the party name and click the
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    button and PCGen will save the party. This in
    turn allows the user to quickly load all PCs in the party. This is
    useful for a DM who manages the PCs in his campaign, allowing him
    to load all PCs in the party with one file name.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Save Party As
    </strong>
    option allows the user to
    save the party under a new filename. This functions much as the
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    command does for PCs.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    Below the
    <strong>
        Save Party
    </strong>
    commands you will find a
    list of the most recently closed or saved parties. These are
    included here to allow convenient loading directly from this
    menu.
