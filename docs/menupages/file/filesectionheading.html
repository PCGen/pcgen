		<h1>File Menu Options</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/menu_file_0.png" alt="File Menu Options"></p>
		
		<p>These are the <strong>File</strong> menu options that are available to use once sources have 
			been loaded. These options are used for starting a new PC, loading an existing PC, or exporting 
			a currently loaded PC to a file.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>New</strong> command allows the user to create a new PC based on the sources that 
			were previously loaded. When this command is used a new PC screen appears and the user can 
			begin to input the information needed to build a PC.</p>

<!--
		<p>The <strong>New NPC</strong> command opens up a new window containing options for creating 
		random characters within a set of parameters you can specify.</p>
-->
		
		<p>The <strong>Open</strong> command opens up a new window and prompts you to pick the PC to load. 
			This folder is the last place that the user selected to save a PC to. The default is the 
			Characters folder under the PCGen main directory.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Close</strong> command closes the PC but does not exit the application. This is 
			used primarily to close the working PC and still be running PCGen but without that PC loaded.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Close All </strong>command closes all loaded and running PC's but does not close 
			the application. This is used for clearing all running PC's that are being worked on.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Save </strong>command saves the current PC that is loaded. If the character has 
			not been saved before, a <strong>Save </strong>command another window will then open up and 
			ask for the name of the file that the user wishes to save it as. Otherwise the <strong>Save</strong> 
			command will automatically use the last filename used.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save As</strong> command allows the user to save the PC as something other than 
			what was previously used. This can be used to change the filename or location. This will 
			create a new file with the new name to be used but will not overwrite the preexisting file 
			that the PC is based off of.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save All</strong> command is used to save all the open PC's to their  respective 
			files and folders. This is a quick way to save multiple loaded PC's at one time using the 
			same names that they previously had before.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Revert to Saved</strong> command reverts all changes made to the character and 
			takes the PC back to the way it originally was when loaded. This reverts all changes made 
			to the PC, discards any added items or updates, and takes it back to the original file.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Party</strong> option allows the user to save all the PC's that	are created as 
			a party and allows quick loading of the party at once. This is useful for a DM who manages 
			the PC's to load all people in the party with one file name.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Print</strong> command sends the selected PC to the printer using one of
			several files.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Once the option is selected another window appears and asks the user to select which 
					file is to be used for printing.</li>
				<li>Once the file is selected select the &quot;Print&quot; button and it will send
					the file off to the printer.</li>
				<li>If you wish to print all the PC's that are loaded select the &quot;Entire
					Party&quot; checkbox and select print.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>The <strong>Export</strong> command exports the PC to a file used to view the PC.
			These are used primarily to view and use the PC with other applications such as 
			Internet Browsers, Adobe Acrobat, OpenRPG, and others.</p>

		<p>The most recently closed or saved character can be loaded directly from this menu.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Exit </strong>command exits PCGen and prompts the user to save the
			application before closing.</p>
