		<h1>File Menu Options</h1>
		
		
<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file.png" alt="File Menu Options" /></p>
		
		<p>These are the <strong>File</strong> options that are available to use once sources 
		have been loaded. These options are used for starting a new PC, loading an existing PC, or export 
		a currently loaded PC to a file.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>New</strong> command allows the user to create a new PC based on the
		sources that were previously loaded. When this command is used a new PC screen appears and the 
		user can begin to input the information needed to build a PC.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>New NPC</strong> command opens up a new window containing options for creating 
		random characters within a set of parameters you can specify.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Open</strong> command opens up a new window and prompts you to pick
		the PC to load. This folder is the last place that the user selected to save a PC to. The default 
		is the Characters folder under the PCGen main directory.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Open Recent</strong> command opens a recently closed or saved
		file. This	is useful for quickly loading saved or closed PC's and wanting
		to open them up and edit them again.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Close</strong> command closes the PC but does not exit the application.
		This is used primarily to close the working PC and still be running PCGen but without that PC loaded.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Close All </strong>command closes all loaded and running PC's
		  but does not close the application. This is used for clearing all running
		  PC's that are being worked on.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save </strong>command saves the current PC that is loaded. If the 
		character has not been saved before, a <strong>Save </strong>command another window will then open up and ask 
		for the name of the file that the user wishes to save it as. Otherwise the <strong>Save</strong> command will 
		automatically use the last filename used.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save As</strong> command allows the user to save the PC as something
		other than what was previously used. This can be used to change the filename or location. 
		This will create a new file with the new name to be used but will not overwrite the preexisting file 
		that the PC is based off of.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save All</strong> command is used to save all the open PC's
		  to their  respective files and folders. This is a quick way to save multiple
		  loaded PC's at one time using 
		the same names that they previously had before.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Revert to Saved</strong> command reverts all changes made to the
		character and takes the PC back to the way it originally was when loaded. This reverts all changes 
		made to the PC, discards any added items or updates, and takes it back to the original file.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Party</strong> option allows the user to save all the PC's that
		  are created as a party and allows quick loading of the party at once. This
		  is useful for a DM who manages 
		the PC's to load all people in the party with one file name.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Print Preview</strong> command displays the current PC in the default
		browser window. First you have to specify a "Default HTML Output Sheet" under 
		<a href="../settings/pcgen/pcgenoutput.html">Preferences</a>. Default Browser can be any html capable browser 
		e.g: Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla, etc. The browser location can be customized via the  
		<a href="../settings/pcgen/pcgenlocation.html">Location Preferences</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Print</strong> command sends the selected PC to the printer using one of
		several files.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Once the option is selected another window appears and asks the user to select which 
			file is to be used for printing.</li>
			<li>Once the file is selected select the &quot;Print&quot; button and it will send
			  the 	file off to the printer.</li>
			<li>If you wish to print all the PC's that are loaded select the &quot;Entire
			  Party&quot;
			  	checkbox and select print.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <strong>Export</strong> command exports the PC to a file used to view the PC.
		These are used primarily to view and use the PC with other applications such as Internet Browsers,
		Adobe Acrobat, OpenRPG, and others.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Add Kit </strong>brings up a dialog box which allows you to apply 
		pre-generated sets of Feats, Skills, Equipment etc, to a character.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Exit </strong>command exits PCGen and prompts the user to save the
		application before closing.</p>
