    The
    <strong>
        Equipment
    </strong>
    options allow the user to setup
    how custom equipment is handled when it is created.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Allow Metamagic feats on potions, wands,
        etc.
    </strong>
    allows the user to apply metamagic feats to
    customized equipment. If this option is deselected the ability to
    add metamagic feats to equipment will not be used.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Potion Maximum Spell Level
    </strong>
    is used to
    select a spell level from 0-9. This defaults to 3 per the Game
    Masters Rules potion creation rules.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Wand Maximum Spell Level
    </strong>
    is used to select
    a spell level from 0-9. This defaults to 4 per the Game Masters
    Rules wand creation rules.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Equipment Auto Creation
    </strong>
    menu has several
    options for creating custom magic items at PCGen's startup.
    ***NOTE*** Some of these options, when selected will cause PCGen to
    take a considerable amount of time to start while it creates the
    items specified.

<ul>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>

        </strong>
        option only loads
        items that were loaded from sources and nothing more.

        magical without being made from a masterwork item or from special
        materials.
