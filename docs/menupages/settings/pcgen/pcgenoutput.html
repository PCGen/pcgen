<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Output
    </strong>
    option allows the user to select a
    default
    <strong>
        HTML
    </strong>
    (Used by Print Preview),
    <strong>
        PDF
    </strong>
    (used by Print) and
    <strong>
        EquipSet
    </strong>
    (generated from the
    <strong>
        Inventory
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
        Equipping
    </strong>
    Sub-tab) output sheets.
</p>
<p>
    It also allows the user to select the paper type, the ability to
    delete temporary files on exit and toggles the weapon proficiency
    display in the sheets.
</p>
<p>
    A new addition is the ability to add a command that will be
    executed after every export (HTML, PDF or others). If you use a %
    on the command, it will be replaced by the fully qualified name of
    the file just created by the export.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Example:
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <code>cmd /c echo % &gt;&gt; exported_files_list.txt</code>
</p>
<p>
    This will keep a list of every exported file in
    exported_files_list.txt in your PCGen directory.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Include Skills on Sheet
    </strong>
    option allows the
    user to select which set of Skills will appear on the exported
    sheet. The default setting is
    <strong>
        Untrained
    </strong>
    which will
    output all skills the character has ranks in as well as skills the
    character may not have ranks in but can be used untrained.
    <strong>
        Skills w/ranks only
    </strong>
    will output only those skills
    the character has ranks in.
    <strong>
        All
    </strong>
    will output all
    skills from the loaded sources.
    <strong>
        Use the option selected on
        the Skills tab
    </strong>
    will default to the option selected on the
    Skills tab.
