</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        House Rules
    </strong>
    option allows certain house
    rules to be applied. These are customizable rules that are not the
    default guidelines established by the Players Rules. The checkmark
    by each option signifies that it is selected to be used for PC
    creation.
    <strong>
        House Rules
    </strong>
    are saved separately for
    each gameMode and each gamemode may have it's own specific set of
    house rules. The rules pictured above are from the 3.5
    gameMode.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Cross-class Skill Cost
    </strong>
    rule has been
    deprecated.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Allow any range for ability scores
    </strong>
    allows
    for ability scores below 8 and above 18, specifically using the
    optional Point Buy system. Unchecked one cannot create a point buy
    method outside the ranges of 8 and 18. Please note that you must
    check this box, close the preferences and open them back up again
    before you can create a point buy method of any range.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Do ammunition enhancement bonus stack with those of the
        weapon
    </strong>
    determine if a ranged weapon and it's ammunition
    stack their enhancement bonuses when the ammo is loaded in the
    weapon. In 3.0 rules the default is yes (checked), in 3.5 rules the
    default is no (unchecked).
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Add stat bonus to spells known
    </strong>
    adds to a
    characters number of spells known using the Table:Ability Modifiers
    and Bonus Spells. Normally characters with a limited number of
    spells known such as Bards and Sorcerers do not get bonus spells
    known due to high ability scores.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Bypass Class Prerequisites
    </strong>
    allows the user
    to ignore the prerequisites for a class and allows them to qualify
    for any class available regardless of what the material allows.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Treat Weapons In Hand As Equipped For
        Attacks
    </strong>
    option allows all weapons that are merely listed
    as 'equipped' but no in hand in the inventory of the character to
    be calculated as if the item were equipped in hand.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Bypass Feat Prerequisites
    </strong>
    allows the user
    to ignore the prerequisites for a feat. If you wish to utilize this
    option it is recommended that you turn it back off once you have
    made your feat selections. Having this option enabled will cause
    problems when leveling up many classes due to the prerequisites
    being bypassed in hidden feats used by the class.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Ask For Free Clothing at First Level
    </strong>
    presents the user with a pop-up when first creating the PC asking
    the user to select a free set of clothing for the PC to wear.
    Deselecting this option will prevent the pop-up from appearing.
    This feature is hardcoded to use the equipment type "Starting"
    which has been added to qualifying clothing.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Increment STAT before calculating skills points
        before leveling
    </strong>
    allows the user to decide if skill points
    are determined before or after a character gets their increase in
    stat (in regards to Intelligence modifying skill points earned)
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Allow Selection of Int bonus Languages after 1st
        level
    </strong>
    allows a character to choose additional bonus
    languages past first level if the characters INT score
    increases.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Ignore Level Cap
    </strong>
    will allow the user to
    exceed the maximum level as defined in the data class files.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Bypass Maximum Skill Rank
    </strong>
    allows the user
    to ignore the maximum level for their skills (3+level) and take as
    many points in any skill as they wish.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Apply 3.5 Size Category Penalty to Attacks
    </strong>
    .
    Unchecking this will cause the size penalty to attacks to be
    ignored.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Apply Casterlevel Bonuses from Domains to
        Spells
    </strong>
    . Some Domains grant Casterlevel bonuses to spells
    of Certain Schools, Subschools or Descriptors as detailed in the
    Domains description. These bonuses are not active by default
    because of a limitation within PCGen. Domains are class abilities
    and the casterlevel bonuses should only apply to spells granted
    from the same class granting the Domain. PCGen cannot limit this
    and will apply a bonus to any qualifying spell regardless of what
    class it comes from. For example if you create a Cleric/Wizard with
    the Knowledge Domain it would grant a +1 Casterlevel bonus to all
    Divination spells Cleric and Wizard alike. We have provided a way
    to activate these bonuses, Under Settings -&gt; Preferences -&gt;
    House Rules you will find the rule "Apply Casterlevel Bonuses from
    Domains to Spells". Checking this box will activate these bonuses.
    Note that if your character does not have spells from other classes
    you will not be breaking any rules.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Apply Load Penalty to AC and Skills
    </strong>
    sets
    the appropriate penalties when a PC's carried equipment changes
    from normal to light, medium, or heavy load. This option affects
    all the penalties going along with having the appropriate load as
    determined in the Players Rules. Not selecting this option will
    allow the PC to have no adverse affects when equipping a heavier
    load than allowed.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Apply Weight Penalty to Skills
    </strong>
    is similar
    to the
    <strong>
        Apply load penalty to AC and skills
    </strong>
    option
    but only applies the weight penalty to skills and not AC.
    Deselecting this penalty will remove all penalties with weight to
    affect the appropriate skills as determined in the Players
    Rules.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Use Hit Point/Use Vitality and Wound Points
    </strong>
    allows the use of the alternate Vitality and Wound Point system
    detailed in Unearthed Arcana.
</p>
<p>
    The 3.5 revision of the rules significantly changed the way
    weapon sizes were handled within the game. The
    <strong>
        Use 3.5
        Weapon Categories / Use 3.0 Weapon Sizes
    </strong>
    choice allows the
    user to choose which version of the Weapons size rules to use
    within PCGen.
