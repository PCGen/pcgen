  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Hit points
   </strong>
   menu option allows the user to
customize which method to use when the PC is created to determine
how Hit Points are allocated.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    User Rolled
   </strong>
   option is the default that
PCGen uses, this means that the users must enter their Hit Points
Manually using the HP button found on either the Summary Tab or
the Classes tab.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Random
   </strong>
   option will present a random
hitpoint total between 1 and the hit die type of the class/race
when a class level is added. The user can modify this total if
desired.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Average
   </strong>
   option will always give the average
hit points as defined by the hit die type of the class/race.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Always maximum
   </strong>
   option will always give the
maximum hit points as defined by the hit die type of the
class/race.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Percentage
   </strong>
   option allows the user to enter
a percentage of the maximum hit points as defined by the hit die
type of the class/race.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Average, Rounded Up
   </strong>
   option will always give
the average hit points as defined by the hit die type of the
class/race rounded up if the average results in a fraction.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Max Hp at first level
   </strong>
   option gives you
maximum Hit Points at first level when you are creating your
character.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Do not apply to Racial Hit Dice
   </strong>
   option
modifies the Max Hp at first level option so it only applied to
character class levels.
