</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Hit points
    </strong>
    menu option allows the user to
    customize which method to use when the PC is created to determine
    how Hit Points are allocated.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        User Rolled
    </strong>
    option is the default that
    PCGen uses, this means that the users must enter their Hit Points
    Manually using the HP button found on either the Summary Tab or
    the Classes tab.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Random
    </strong>
    option will present a random
    hitpoint total between 1 and the hit die type of the class/race
    when a class level is added. The user can modify this total if
    desired.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Average
    </strong>
    option will always give the average
    hit points as defined by the hit die type of the class/race.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Always maximum
    </strong>
    option will always give the
    maximum hit points as defined by the hit die type of the
    class/race.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Percentage
    </strong>
    option allows the user to enter
    a percentage of the maximum hit points as defined by the hit die
    type of the class/race.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Average, Rounded Up
    </strong>
    option will always give
    the average hit points as defined by the hit die type of the
    class/race rounded up if the average results in a fraction.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Max Hp at first level
    </strong>
    option gives you
    maximum Hit Points at first level when you are creating your
    character.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Do not apply to Racial Hit Dice
    </strong>
    option
    modifies the Max Hp at first level option so it only applied to
    character class levels.
