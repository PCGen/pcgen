      Can you explain to me the whole
WOTC/OGL/SRD/D20 Thing?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            When 3rd edition came out in 2000, Wizards of the Coast (WotC)
            also created the
            <a href="http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/OGLv1.0a.rtf">
                Open Gaming License
                (OGL)
            </a>
            . This would allow 3rd party publishers to use Open Game
            Content (OGC) as long as they followed the rules laid out in the
            OGL. WotC took most, but not all, of the material in the PHB, DMG
            and MM and created the System Reference Document (SRD). They
            declared this to be OGC, which is what the 3rd party publishers
            initially used. At a later date, WotC added material from the
            Psionics Handbook to the SRD.
        </p>
        <p>
            When d20 Modern came out, WotC created the Modern
            <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/msrd">
                System
                Reference Document (MSRD)
            </a>
            . This contains material from d20
            Modern, d20 Future, Menace Manual and Urban Arcana.
        </p>
        <p>
            When 3.5 came out, WotC created the
            <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35">
                Revised
                System Reference Document (RSRD)
            </a>
            . This contains material from
            the 3.5 PHB, 3.5 DMG, 3.5 MM, Expanded Psionics Handbook, Deities
            and Demigods (not everything in this material was converted to
            3.5), Epic Level Handbook (as Deities and Demigods) and a little
            bit from Manual of the Planes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any material that WotC did not place in the various Reference
            Documents is not available for 3rd party publishers to use. The Red
            Wizard of Thay did not make it into the RSRD, so PCGen can not
            include that in our distribution.
