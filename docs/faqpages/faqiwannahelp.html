<h1>I Want to Help to Make Datasets</h1>
<p><span class="underline">How do I get started?</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>
        <p class="indent1">First do you have the current version of PcGen
            running on your system. If you do then you have Java installed and
            are ready for fun. If you need help, open a command box and
            type:</p>
        <p class="indent2"><code>java -version</code></p>
        <p class="indent2">And you should get something like:</p>
        <p class="indent3"><code>java version "1.5.0_06"</code></p>
        <p class="indent3"><code>Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard
            Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)</code></p>
        <p class="indent3"><code>Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build
            1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode, sharing)</code></p>
        <p class="indent2">If you don't, you need to get it from Sun
            Systems. <a href=
                                "http://www.sun.com/java/"><strong>http://www.sun.com/java/</strong></a></p>
        <p class="indent2">If you're having problems with the operation of
            PCGen you likely have a "less-than-complete" version of Java and
            need to replace it, see above.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Java comes in two variety's, the JRE that you
            need and the JDK that you don't unless you are planning on coding
            the PCGen program itself.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="indent1">Secondly you should have a look at what is in
            your library at home and compare that against what is listed in
            <a href=
                       "../acknowledgments/publishersandsources.html#sources">Sources</a>
            and see if we already have that product in PCGen. If not then check
            the <a href=
                           "../acknowledgments/publishersandsources.html#publishers">Publisher
                Permissions</a> section to see if we have permission to create a
            dataset for that publisher.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="indent1">This next section no longer holds true, we are
            working on removing this information and putting it into these docs
            instead.</p>
        <p class="indent2">The wiki is at: <a href=
                                                      "http://wiki.pcgen.org/"><strong>http://wiki.pcgen.org/</strong></a>
        </p>
        <p class="indent2">Find the link marked Publishers, that's the list
            of "The following publishers have either Supported Datasets, Alpha
            Datasets or have been requested as part of New Data set
            Wishlist."</p>
        <p class="indent2">What the separations mean:</p>
        <p class="indent3">Supported Datasets - Been thrown in the mill and
            tested and used and we think they are right.</p>
        <p class="indent3">Alpha Datasets - Fully tested as we can, now its
            time for the users to use them and figure what's wrong and tell us
            all about it.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Click the link 'New Data set Wishlist", there is
            everything that someone wants that we have permission to do.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Click on the "SourcesInDevelopment" and that's
            one of the two places to find out who is working on what. If you
            are working on something list it here. The other is at <a href=
                                                                              "http://jira.pcgen.org/"><strong>the JIRA
                issue tracker.</strong></a></p>

        <p class="indent1">Ok so we have figured out that you have PcGen
            and a book to code, so how to make a dataset. Open the PcGen
            directory, open the docs directory, down at the bottom are a bunch
            of .html files:</p>
        <ul class="indent2">
            <li><code>greetings.html</code> - just that a greeting from us to
                the user. Used in index.html
            </li>
            <li><code>index.html</code> - combination of help and
                documentation. This is the same help file accessed from inside the
                program. It tells new/old users all they need to know. Check often
                it does change. I'll probably put this up there somewhere.
            </li>
            <li><code>navlistindex.html</code> - Documents all of the lst tags
                that we know of. This is the one that you want.
            </li>
            <li><code>navtokenindex.html</code> - this is the output sheet tags
                (they call then tokens), if you need to make a output sheet this is
                the instructions and index.html has a section on output sheets, the
                making of.
            </li>
            <li><code>navtree.html</code> - the is the selector part of
                index.html.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="indent1">Ok you know where the tags are located
            (navlistindex.html), you have a book, now you need an editor to
            work in. You can use the built in editor if it saves as text only,
            with no special formatting, or you can try a special editor with
            syntax coloring.</p>

        <p class="indent1">Go over to Experimental <a href=

            , go into the files, (err you do have a yahoo account don't you,
            their free and I keep being asked my password to get in so.) and
            down towards the bottom is the folder Application Support, this
            holds most of the editors that we have syntax modules for. If you
            want to use one and need help, just ask on PcGen if you can't find
            a thread about it in the archives. While you are there download a
            copy of prettylst_1-35_ build-561.zip or whatever prettylst.zip
            that is there.</p>
        <p class="indent2">While you are there look in the files
            marked:</p>
        <p class="indent2">Step 1 - WORK IN PROGRESS, INCOMPLETE DATASETS
            GO HERE</p>
        <p class="indent2">New datasets and work in progress (Once
            completed move to Step 2 and the senior data monkeys will begin the
            review process)</p>
        <p class="indent2">This will have the partial datasets that the
            developer ran out of time to do. You might check and see if someone
            did some work on yours.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Go ahead and look through the rest of them, they
            basically tell you the way the submission process goes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="indent1">Ok now you have all the bits and pieces that you
            need. Almost. Did you close your docs directory, well you need to
            go up one level and open the data directory.</p>
        <p class="indent2">alpha directory - Remember the Alpha Datasets,
            this is where they are placed.</p>
        <p class="indent2">customsources directory - No young Grasshopper,
            this is not for you, this is where PcGen places custom items it
            creates inside the program. Unless its code is in the character it
            never looks at this directory for any reason.</p>
        <p class="indent2">d20ogl directory - Remember the Supported
            Datasets, this is where they are placed.</p>
        <p class="indent2">homebrew directory - This is where you will find
            a directory with a blank starter dataset, both titled <span class=
                                                                                "lstfile">my_dataset</span>, for you to
            play with. One thing to
            keep in mind when using this dataset is that you will need to move
            this set to the next version of the program when you upgrade.</p>
        <p class="indent2">permissioned directory - Remember the New Data
            set Wishlist, this is where they are placed. After they are passed
            threw Step 2 and later. Until then...</p>
        <p class="indent2">Either make a new directory and drop the starter
            set in it and copy as needed, or as a lot of other people are doing
            and moving the datafile directory outside PcGen directory
            structure. To just right off the drive root,</p>
        <p class="indent2">Inside the program is the Preferences screen (do
            you still have the docs directory open? Double click on the
            index.html, click on the Menu Items -&gt; Settings Menu -&gt;
            Preferences Menu -&gt; PCGen Menu -&gt; Location ). You are now
            looking at the configuration screen for darn near everything.
            Please note one thing, there is no reset to factory button. You
            mess this up and its reinstall time, including the homebrew
            directory if you don't take steps to protect it.</p>
        <p class="indent2">What I am pointing out is two fields only at
            this time:</p>
        <p class="indent2">The Custom Directory - This is where the list
            files for custom source files generated by the list editors are
            located. Point this at where you put your now custom directory.</p>
        <p class="indent2">The Vendor Data Directory - This is where the
            list files for additional source files produced by third parties of
            the users are located.</p>
        <p class="indent2">You may not have found out yet, but PcGen has a
            total removal built in to the program, with no verify that you mean
            to remove the whole thing, the next thing you know everything,
            including the files that you spent six months on are gone. So get
            that directory clear of the program and pit it just off the root of
            the drive, you need it there in the future.</p>
        <p class="indent2">All this reading, downloading, and snooping and
            no coding yet. Nope still some other things first.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Go to the directory that you made, go in and
            make a copy of the homebrew directory and name the directory (in
            abbreviated form) after your book. See the data directory for
            ideas. I'm coding the d20 Weapons Locker by Wizard of the Coast.
            That's a long name, shortened to d20WL.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Now open the copy of the directory and stick the
            shortened name in front of the files in there (go from
            my__campaign.pcc to d20WL_my__campaign.pcc). Don't get attached,
            the publisher gets final say on the product I do believe.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Now your ready to dive in and start coding the
            dataset. Did you close the index.html, if you did, reopen it, if
            you didn't close everything and open the List Files -&gt; LST File
            Class (My goodness someone did some classes) -&gt; Lesson #1: PCC -
            Campaign Info.. The information may be old, but its still useful
            and if you want to get the new classes as they come out:</p>
        <p class="indent2"><a href=
                                      "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lstfileclass"><strong>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lstfileclass</strong></a>
        </p>
        <p class="indent2">There is a bunch of new tags out, so there is a
            rewrite of old classes and new classes for not yet covered
            items.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Have questions about how to setup a tag, ask on
            <a href=
                       "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp"><strong>PCGenListFileHelp</strong></a>,
            remember don't ask about the non-OGL, but feel free to ask about
            anything else including Foo items. A food item might sound a lot
            like a non-OGL item, but since its not using the Product Identity
            name (PI) that can't be used its permitted, Besides I don't have a
            certain book that is non-OGL that is sold over at <a href=
                                                                         "http://www.codemonkeypublishing.com/"><strong>Code
                Monkey
                Publishing</strong></a> in a dataset format that we can almost use
            (you need their core rule set as well to use their datasets) but I
            have feats that come out of it, inflicted on me by the GM. So I
            know the name and the effects. I just call it a food feat that
            gives me a capability to move underwater and someone comes back
            with the appropriate combination of tags to give me the movement
            underwater that I lack and the movement rate.</p>
        <p class="indent2">So you have a bunch of files in a directory to
            be checked (either for your own use or for inclusion in the
            repository). A month or two later do you really think you remember
            where you put the prettylst.zip that I had you download. I'll tell
            you right now that the version of prettylst that I have hates two
            part words, so if the word Program Files (or any other phrases that
            have a space in them) is between prettylst and your custom
            directory, its time to move the directory to where I told you.</p>
        <p class="indent2">There is one more file that you need to find,
            download and install. Get Perl. It is necessary to run prettylst.
            You can use Active Perl from
            http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ or find another
            distribution at http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html. Just install
            Perl and you are ready to go.</p>
        <p class="indent2">Ok open a command line box and type</p>

        <p class="indent2">I use command lines saves to a word document.
            The first:</p>
