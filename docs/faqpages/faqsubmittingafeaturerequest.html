<h1>
    Submitting a Feature Request for PCGen
</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of this document is to provide a walk through of how
    to properly submit a feature request at Source Forge for PCGen.
    Please read the
    <a href="faqsubmittingabugreport.html">
        Bug vs.
        Feature
    </a>
    to make sure that what you want to submit is a feature
    request.
</p>
<p>
    Before you attempt to submit a feature request, visit the PCGen
    Yahoo Group message boards (
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen">
        http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen
    </a>
    ),
    and describe your feature request. Feature Requests are often
    referred to as FREQs on the board. This way others can help you
    refine the request or tell you that it's already been entered as a
    FREQ or even point out that the FREQ would be useful for another
    book as well. Once the FREQ has been kicked about and refined you
    can then submit it.
