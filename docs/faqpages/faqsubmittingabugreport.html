    The JIRA issue tracker
</h1>
<p>
    The PCGen project uses a system named
    <code>JIRA</code>
    , located at
    <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">
        jira.pcgen.org
    </a>
    , to track bug reports and feature requests (
    <em>
        issues
    </em>
    ).
</p>
<p>
    This page explains how to submit bug reports or feature requests for the PCGen project.
</p>
<p>
    Note: JIRA has replaced the previous issue tracker at SourceForge, which is no longer used.

    Once the issue is created, the project team will be notified there is a new issue for their attention.

    The sub-projects are as listed below.
</p>
<p>
    Filing your issue under the right sub-project helps members of the development team to keep track of their part of
    the project. If in doubt, pick the sub-project you think is the closest match for your issue; someone will fix it up
    afterwards, if required.
