      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     Here there are 5000+ users to help you, good eh! Post whatever
PCGen related questions, comments etc you have (but please report
bugs and feature requests as described below). Very, very rarely
does a post go unnoticed, in fact you will be overwhelmed with help
most of the time. Please be aware that post to the yahoo groups
gains you the attention of Karianna, s/he may or may not decide to
take you soul, your risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you for some reason cannot get access to Yahoo or are really
struggling, contact David R. Bender (Papa_DRB), he's the
moderator.

    <p>
     In addition to the main group there are a few other Yahoo groups
devoted to the more arcane aspects of PCGen. They are:
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/">
      PCGen
Experimental
     </a>
     - Devoted to developing new data sources and LST
tag syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp/">
      List
File Help
     </a>
     - The place to go for advice and help coding your own
custom LST files.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LSTfileclass/">

      Why are my messages in the yahoo groups
board being ignored?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     This happens pretty rarely, but probably because we are busy
eating bananas.
    </p>
    <p>
     How long is it since you posted this message? The message-board
receive many, many mails a day. Because of this, many users choose
to receive the digest version of the mails. This slows things down.
An other reason might be that your question is answered either in
this FAQ or in one of the many html-files in the
documentation-files included in PCGen. Check those, and then, if
you still get nowhere, post again, with the legend REPOST somewhere
in your heading. Of course, you might have hit upon something that
no-one has thought of, and everyone is right now hacking away at
their computers and PCGen to solve your problem, in any case, be
patient.

      Working with issues and Tracker
Monkeys.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     A lot of work is done through the Yahoo Group and because of the
large volume of traffic your message might easily be overlooked by
the person or team you are trying to reach. Adding certain tags to
the subjects of your posts helps the monkeys filter through the
noise and catch the posts relevant to their area of expertise. The
Tracker Monkeys are the link between all the teams and the
community at large and are usually the ones to contact with
questions, bug reports and feature requests.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you want to get the attention of a tracker monkey, please put
'[TM]' in your subject line. If you think it is a bug, put '[BUG]';
a freq, '[FREQ]'; it relates to code, '[CODE]'; data, '[DATA]';
output sheets, '[OS]'.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you enter a issue off of a request made on any of the boards,
please put '[trackered]' in the reply subject, with the issue
number and URL of the issue. This is to cut down on the duplicating
efforts. For example, if you see a string of issue requests and a
'[trackered]' with them, you know that someone has entered the
issue already.
    </p>
    <p>

     Well of course you do! OK, there are a vast variety of ways in
which you can help us here at PCGen. We can use:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      JAVA Coders (Code Monkeys)
     </li>
     <li>
      LST file editors (Data Monkeys)
     </li>
     <li>
      Admin Monkeys
     </li>

      <strong>
       Anybody who wants to, no matter your level of
experience!
      </strong>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     We could go into vast detail here on how you could help in any
particular section. But the way to join is posting a message to
Yahoo with the title:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I WANT TO HELP"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Someone will claim your soul shortly afterwards and help you
offline on how to go about doing things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Needless to say, this is one of the most fun and rewarding
communities you can join! PCGen is about
     <strong>
      FUN
     </strong>
     , just
read an average day of the message boards and you'll see what I
mean!

    <p>
     See
     <a href="faqmonkeyteamsexplained.html">

      How do I submit list files from official
RPG products?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, if you've made the list files, and want them to be checked
out by everyone to see their worthiness, then you can post them in
a zip file to:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/files/">
      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/files/
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     Choose an appropriate sub folder, contact the Content Silverback
if you can't decide.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once everyone has gone over them, or you feel they are ready to
be included in the alpha/beta releases of PCGen, then Post a
message to the yahoo group
     <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental">
      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental
     </a>
     with the subject line reading "TRACKER MONKEYS PLEASE PUT THESE
FILES INTO THE TRACKER SYSTEM" and the Files will disappear from
the Yahoo Files Section and 'auto-magically' appear in the PCGen
issue tracking system.
    </p>
    <p>
     If they pass the List Monkeys tests, then they get included into
the Alpha/Beta builds, if not, they will get kicked back to the
Tracker with a note for the Tracker Monkeys to notify you.

      I've finished the list files, but I
don't know if I should put them in the yahoo group yet, as I
haven't contacted the Publisher for permission, what do I
do?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Check the
     <a href="../acknowledgments/publishersandsources.html">
      Publisher
Permissions list
     </a>
     in this document for the list of publishers
that have given us permission to include their stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are unsure of who to contact, or are unsure or know you
suck at people skills, you can leave a txt file in the zip stating
that you did not contact anyone. If you do contact the publisher
for permission, please make the txt file in the zip with who you
contacted and what their response was. copies of the email
exchanges are highly recommended. At the very minimum, include who
you exchanged email with, what date it was, and what their response
was.

      I've Converted a 1st/2nd Ed Source
Material, can we include those in the releases?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The short answer is no. Unless a 1st/2nd Ed product has been
officially converted into 3ed rules and you have permission from
the publisher, we can't include them.
    </p>

     <span class="underline">
      I've created my own custom campaign
world, can I include that in the releases?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The short answer is again no. You can however, if you wish to
share you're work, post them here in zip format:
     <br/>
     <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/Campaign+Central/UnOfficial%20&amp;%20Converted%20Source%20Material/">

     for others on the yahoo group to share.
