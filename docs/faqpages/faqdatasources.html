      What is the System Reference Document
(SRD)?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's basically a Open Gaming License subset of what's in the
            PHB, DMG, MM, Epic Level Handbook and the Psionics Handbook, the
            real difference being that what Wizards of the Coast has declared
            as Product Identity (PI) or Closed Content. That means the deities
            are not in there, some monsters, character names and places are
            omitted, and spell names may have been changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            See WotC's declaration what is not Open Content here:
            <a href="http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/v35/Legal.rtf">
                SRD Legal
                Information
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            All non-SRD material (e.g. the splat books: Complete Warrior,
            Defenders of the Faith, Sword and Fist, Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun,
            etc. all TM of Wizards of the Coast) was handled by Code Monkey
            Publishing (see the next item).

      Why is book XYZ not included in
PCGen?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few possible causes for this situation and the
            explanation hold true for both datasets that have never been in
            PCGen and some which have been in PCGen but were removed.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If the book is closed content, then we may not have permission
                from the publisher, or may not have permission to include enough
                data to allow the data to be useful to our users.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the book if partially or completely OGL content, then we
                still require permission from the publisher because the publisher
                name and book title are both trademarks. Under the OGL, we require
                permission to use those to identify the source of the data. We
                believe if we cannot identify the source of the data, then the
                value to PCGen users is lost (how do you find the data?), so we
                will not include a dataset for that source.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is possible that PCGen does not have the features to support
                a sufficient amount of the data from a given source, and thus is
                not included in our production release (or is included as an alpha
                source)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            For more information on what sources are available in PCGen and
            explanations for those that are not, please refer to our Publisher
            Permissions page with this documentation set.

      Where are Wizards of the Coast's books
and modules?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Those had been handled under a special license by the gang at
            <a href="http://www.codemonkeypublishing.com">
                Code Monkey
                Publishing

            (CMP). Sadly, late in 2006, WOTC declined to renew
            CMP's licence, and so they are no longer available for
            distribution.

            Even though Wizards of the Coast produces those books, they
            don't own exclusive rights to that material. We'll need to get
            permission from both Wizards and the other copyright owner(s) of
            said material before we can include them in PCGen. It is our
            intention to acquire this permission, but we're being very careful
            about how we proceed to maximize our chance of success. We'll keep
            everyone informed when anything worthy of reporting occurs. :)

      How do I include sources from Game Mode
X in Game Mode Y that I currently use?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to do this, but you need to understand that this
            may cause errors due to incompatibility of the different Game
            Modes..
        </p>
        <p>
            To include all of Game Mode X's sources in Game Mode Y.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the system/gamemode folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose the Y game mode folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open miscinfo.lst.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find the ALLOWEDMODES tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Append '|X' to this line.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Now, all of the sources associated with Game Mode X will show up
            in Y. Remember you may experience problems while doing this.
        </p>
        <p>
            To include specific sources from game mode X in game mode Y.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the *.pcc of the game mode X source in question.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find the GAMEMODE tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open miscinfo.lst.
            </li>
            <li>
                Append '|Y' to this line.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat for every source wanted.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Now, all of these specific sources from game mode X will show up
            in Y. Remember you may experience problems due to Game Mode
            incompatibilities while doing this.
