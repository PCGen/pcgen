<h2>
    The
    <big>
        BIG
    </big>
    Question:
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    "What is PCGen?" they cry. Well ladies and
    gentlemen (and chimps), let us tell you. PCGen is a
    <strong>
        FREE
    </strong>
    open source software application for creating
    characters in RPG role-playing games. Simple as that, good eh!
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    It is also a religion for some, a home for lost
    souls (We are really nice to them), a place to party online,
    somewhere to brush up on those IT skills, a place to practice your
    good natured insults and most importantly a project of
    <strong>
        Fun!
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    PCGen has been a massive labor of love started
    by Merton Monk (Bryan McRoberts) and now shared by 100+ helpers and
    _thousands_ of users. It's cool, it rocks and you should use it
    because it is.............
    <strong>
        FREE
    </strong>
    .

<h2>
    The
    <small>
        Little
    </small>
    Question:
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    <em>
        "Who are the dictators of these mindless
        hoards of monkeys?"
    </em>
    they cry. Well ladies and gentlemen (and
    chimps), let us tell you.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    An acknowledgment section has been added to the
    documentation that endeavors to include all PCGen
    participants.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The Board of Directors list in that section
    shows the current team leadership. These monkeys got their
    positions by contributing more on a consistent basis than any of
    the other volunteers. They have displayed an in depth working
    knowledge of their area and are willing to put countless hours of
    time into ensuring that PCGen continues to be the best Character
    Generator available anywhere. You'll see them trying to suck souls,
    crack whips and generally bullying the monkey populace for the good
    of all PCGen :) We've even made one sing "I'm a little teapot" at
    Gencon, you've been warned.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    If you have contributed in the past and are not
    mentioned as you rightly should be, please email the current
    Content Silverback or the Documentation Second with the team you
    were a part of and what you actually worked on. You will then be
    added to the relevant section for posterity :)
