      Where do I download PCGen
from?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can download the latest version of PCGen from:
            <br/>
            <a href="http://pcgen.org/">
                http://pcgen.org/
            </a>
            ,
            see the
            <strong>
                "Get PCGen"
            </strong>
            tab which will answer all of
            your questions on this!

      How do I unzip the zipped up
files?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the install packages are zipped up. Those types of
            downloads
            <strong>
                must
            </strong>
            be unzipped to
            <strong>
                the same
                directory / folder
            </strong>
            . Unzipping is done differently on
            different platforms (don't ya hate that?).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Windows
            </strong>
            users should download a zip utility
            such as
            <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">
                WinZip
            </a>
            . Here are some
            sample instructions for WinZip. After WinZip has been installed,
            double-click the file. This will open the file in WinZip. On the
            menu-bar, click the "Extract to..." button, and enter the location
            where you want to have PCGen (Example:
            <code>c:\tools\pcgen</code>
            ). Make sure you have the "Include
            Subfolders" option checked!!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Mac OS X
            </strong>
            users can simply double-click the file
            which unzips it. Then it is simply (we FAQ authors _love_ that
            word) a case of moving the new folder somewhere (preferably in the
            Applications folder).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Linux/Unix
            </strong>
            users should use Gzip. Unix/Linux
            users by there nature should know what they are doing by now
            ;-)
        </p>
        <p>
            Or, as an alternative to the 3 above, you can download one of
            the platform-specific installer-files. _Most_ of these will do all
            the work for you if you just download them, and then double-click
            on whatever came down.

      What do I need besides the zip-files to
get the program running?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Glad you asked, because for many of you the instructions failed
            didn't they? Well here's why.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure that have the Java 2 v1.6.x or above Runtime
            Environment (or the SDK) installed on your machine. It's available
            from:
            <a href="http://java.com/en/download/">
                http://java.com/en/download/
            </a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            Mac users should note that Apple does not, and will not, support
            Java 2 v1.7.x or greater for Mac OSX 10.6.8 or earlier.
        </p>
    </li>

     <span class="underline">
      Will PCGen run on my machine?
     </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            That depends. The one thing that decides if you can run PCGen or
            not, is whether you have at least JAVA 1.6+ installed. If you do,
            then it should run. If not, it won't. It really is that simple.

        <p>
            Starting with Mac OSX 10.7 Apple added an anti-malware
            application called the
            <strong>
                Gatekeeper
            </strong>
            . The purpose of
            this addition to the Mac OS was to restrict applications downloaded
            from the Internet from launching. Initially Gatekeeper had no
            teeth, requiring the user to "opt-in" as it's default startup
            settings were to allow everything to run. Starting with Mac OSX
            10.8, Gatekeeper's default setting was changed to restrict
            everything that was not downloaded either from the App Store or
            from an otherwise "identified" developer. Fortunately Apple did
            provide for a workaround which is described below:

                Open System Preferences by choosing it from the Apple
                menu.

            <li>
                Select the "Security &amp; Privacy" control panel and go to the

            <li>
                Under "Allow applications downloaded from:" click the radio
                button next to "Anywhere".
            </li>
            <li>
                On the dialog box that pops up select the "Allow From Anywhere"
                button to change the setting and close the Preferences window.
            </li>
            <li>
                Launch PCGen and verify that it is working. (If PCGen still
                doesn't launch please drop by the PCGen forum and provide a
                report.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Relaunch System Preferences and change Gatekeeper's settings
                back to the original setting.

      Why is the Source "Load" tab all

        </p>
        <p>
            This might be because your machine have a problem finding the
            files PCGen refers to. There is no easy way to fix this (there
            never is). There are machine-specific releases of PCGen available,
            but unless you choose to use one of these, you'll have to manually
            change the addressing in the files you're to access. Normally this
            is a case of changing a
            <code>/</code>
            to a
            <code>\</code>
            or the
            other way round. Also make sure that you don't try to access
            something like
            <code>c:/program files/pcgen/</code>
            when you should
            be accessing
            <code>c:/program~1/pcgen/</code>
            , or vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that on Windows, enclosing the entire path in double
            quotation marks is an acceptable way to accessing the directory,
            i.e.
            <code>"c:\program files\pcgen\"</code>
            .

     Why can't I make a new character? The
"New" menu-item is grayed out.
    </span>
        <p>
            This is probably the most asked question so far. The answer is
            this: Before you can make a character, you must tell PCGen which
            rule books it should use. In other words, you must load one or more
            source books or modules listed under the "Source Material"-tab
            before you can make a new character. Make sure that at least one
            module is marked by a "Y" instead of a "N".

            You might wonder why PCGen doesn't do this automatically. This
            is because PCGen is made to be a RPG-generator. As it stands now,
            you may choose to load a Fantasy, Sci-Fi or Contempory module
            instead. Had PCGen automatically loaded a module, say the Fantasy
            module, it would have been the wrong one and you would then grumble
            about our stupid defaults while you unloaded that module so you
            could then load the module you wanted, the Sci-Fi
            RPG-character.

            There are options to load sources on start up or as you open a
            PC, take your pick, we don't mind ;-).

                    pcgen.filepaths
                </strong>
                - Specify the location of the
                filepaths file, which lists where the other settings files are
                expected.

                in the preferences section.

                <strong>
                    pcgen.filter
                </strong>
                - Specify the location of the

                <strong>
                    pcgen.templatefile
                </strong>
                - Specify the character
                sheet template file to be used for automatically generating a
                character sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    pcgen.inputfile
                </strong>
                - Specify the PCG file of the
                character to be used for automatically generating a character
                sheet.

            <li>
                <strong>
                    pcgen.outputfile
                </strong>
                - Specify the name of the
                output file in which the automatically generated character sheet
                will be stored.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When a value is specified for pcgen.inputfile, the program runs
            in command line only mode and does not display the gui, but instead
            generates a character sheet and exits.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition you can provide any number of character or party
            files for PCGen to load on startup by just listing them on the
            command line.
