    PCGen Monkey Teams Explained
</h1>
<p class="bolditalicunderline">
    Who does what?
</p>
<p>
    In the "About" box of PCGen, you'll quickly notice the PCGen has
    a monkey theme. Bryan McRoberts chose "Chief Code Monkey" as his
    title when he first made PCGen available to the public, and later
    adopted the title of Benevolent Dictator. Other teams formed to
    focus on different aspects of PCGen, and all have taken to
    referring to themselves as monkeys. In the About box we try to list
    everyone who has contributed to PCGen in chronological order, and
    the monkeys are grouped into Code, Content, Test and
    Engineering.
</p>
<p class="bolditalicunderline">
    Here's a primer on what each team
    does, see the
    <a href="../acknowledgments/bod.html">
        Board of
        Directors
    </a>
    page for a list of those in charge of each team:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Code Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This team works on the java code. Their issues are located at
    <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">
        http://jira.pcgen.org
    </a>
    .
</p>

    <strong>
        Content
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This team encompasses all content published with PCGen. This
    includes Data, Docs and Output Sheets.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Data Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Data Monkeys work on the data for all the books you load in
    PCGen. They help answer data questions at the PCGenListFileHelp.
    They have pcgen_experimental group where they actually work on the
    different books we're trying to get into PCGen. Their issues are
    located at
    <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">
        http://jira.pcgen.org
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Doc Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Doc Monkeys work on the documentation. Their issues are located
    <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">
        http://jira.pcgen.org
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Output Sheet Monkeys (OS
        Monkeys)
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Output Sheet Monkeys work on the output sheets which are used
    to export to character sheets in PCGen. These templates involve
    xml, xsl and html. Their issues are located at
    <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">
        http://jira.pcgen.org
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Public Relations Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This team encompasses all public relations work with PCGen. This
    includes Publisher Liaison, Data License and Advertising.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Publisher Liaison Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This team servers as the contact for all the publishers. This way
    all contact with publishers can be more easily managed and
    consistent.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Data License Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This team makes sure that all material included in PCGen meets any
    license requirements (not just the OGL).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Advertising Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This team deals with Advertising PCGen in magazines etc.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Admin Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This is the team that monitors the pcgen yahoo site for bug reports
    and feature requests. They also prioritize all issues submitted at
    the JIRA site and generally organise the project.
</p>
<p class="bolditalicunderline">
    More Detailed Listing of what each
    team does:
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Code Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <em>
        Requirements:
    </em>
    Java (any amount)
    <br/>
    Some code monkeys work on the interface (GUI), some work on the
    engine (business logic), some work on optimizations and others
    perform routine maintenance. All levels of java (even newbie) are
    accepted and if you've got the time, we've got plenty to do! There
    is a Developer's Forum where questions from really basic to very
    advanced can be asked. I'm generally happy to let people work on
    the section of code that most interests (or irritates!) them,
    though I ask that all developers help out with the high priority
    issues (bugs or feature requests at
    <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">
        http://jira.pcgen.org
    </a>
    ) since that's
    what has been deemed to be necessary for the next production
    release of PCGen.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Data Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <em>
        Requirements:
    </em>
    Accurate typing, preferably some amount of
    experience with a computer language of any kind
    <br/>
    Newbie data monkeys are generally asked to do an initial swipe on a
    book. Most data monkeys develop a mastery of one area of data (like
    classes or feats or races), and as they advance they are asked to
    check the work of other newbie data monkeys. All work currently is
    done in a proprietary data language called LST (after the adopted
    extensions of all the data files) and most of it is pretty easy to
    pick up. There are some bits of it that are more difficult to
    master, and data gurus are highly prized. :) As data is worked on,
    it's uploaded to pcgen_experimental so the Data License and
    Publisher teams can check them. Once a source is completed and
    checked, it's added to the PCGen releases.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Doc Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <em>
        Requirements:
    </em>
    Ability to describe clearly how to use
    software and to present it in an appealing manner.
    <br/>
    The Documentation team is responsible for making sure that the
    screen pics are up-to-date and that the descriptions of how to use
    the interface makes PCGen understandable for first-time users. They
    also update the documentation on the LST language to help data
    monkeys do their work. The documentation is done in html.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Output Sheet Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <em>
        Requirements:
    </em>
    Familiarity with xml/xsl/htm, preferably
    some java
    <br/>
    Some OS Monkeys work in xml/xsl, and others work in html. It's
    helpful if they also know java so they can look at the code of
    PCGen itself to better understand (and even modify) what it's doing
    when it outputs a character sheet.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Publisher Liaison Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <em>
        Requirements:
    </em>
    Desire to communicate to publishers and
    ability to communicate clearly
    <br/>
    Since this group is our contact point with all publishers, it's a
    small group.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Data License Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <em>
        Requirements:
    </em>
    Ability to understand and explain licenses
    like the OGL, LGPL and other licenses with which PCGen must
    comply.
    <br/>
    This team checks all data to make sure that it complies with the
    <a href="../acknowledgments/ogllicense.html">
        OpenGamingLicense
    </a>
    ,
    the
    <a href="../acknowledgments/gnulicense.html">
        Lesser GPL
    </a>
    and
    any other licenses that apply to PCGen. Any issues found are
    immediately reported - to pcgen_experimental if it's a data issue,
    to the
    <a href="./faqsubmittingabugreport.html">
        JIRA issue tracker
    </a>
    if it's a code issue.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Admin Monkeys
    </strong>
    <br/>
    This is the team that monitors the pcgen yahoo group for bug and
    feature requests. Any bugs that are confirmed are entered as a
    issue in the appropriate areas. After the confirm/reject a report,
    they respond to the user's post to indicate the issue number or to
    indicate that they couldn't reproduce it. Some Admin staff help
    monitor the Files folders where users can upload character files
    that exhibit a bug they're reporting. Other Admin staff help
    monitor all items submitted to the various groups and make sure
    they're not duplicates, and adjust the priority on the item
    according to the list of rules supplied by the Board of
    Directors.
</p>
<p>
    If you have time and talent, which team should you join? All the
    teams are always looking for new people to join. It's understood
    that there's a learning curve for anyone new, but we were all there
    once so we're all glad to help mentor any willing volunteers. PCGen
    is a lot of fun because it helps make our games more manageable and
    because the teams get along so well. If you get tired of one team,
    it's no problem to switch to another. If you're not sure which team
    to join and you think you fit the needs for a few of them - let us
    know and we'll be glad to put you wherever the most dire need
    currently resides.
