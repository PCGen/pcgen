  <h1>
   Documentation Standards
  </h1>
  <p class="indent0">
   This page will be used to provide standards to
follow in the creation of documentation pages for PCGen.
  </p>
  <h2>
   General Documentation Standards
  </h2>
  <p class="indent0">
  </p>
  <ol class="indent0">
   <li>
    Each page should have information commented in the page which
should contain the names of those contributing to the creation and
maintenance of the page. There should also be a brief description
of the purpose of the page and in the case of LST File Tag Pages, a
basic to how to create the specific LST Objects covered by that
page.
   </li>
   <li>
    The documentation should, in general, document what PCGen, with
its LST Tags and OS Tokens, DO. Instances of documenting what PCGen
WONT do should be minimized.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
   LST Tag Documentation Standards
  </h2>
  <p class="indent0">
   The following is a generic example of the format
to be used when documenting LST tags. You can copy the code and use
it as a starting point for new entries if you wish. Following the
entry will be a detailed explanation of how the format is should be
used.

  <h3>
   Anchors
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   If you examine the source code you will see that
the first line of the entry contains a named anchor next to the
horizontal rule. This is so the entry can be linked to from the
index and other relevant entries. The anchor name should match the
tag name up to the first variable minus any symbols used. See the
source code for examples
  </p>
  <h3>
   State of the entry
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   Some entries are labeled "
   <span class="lstnew">
    New
   </span>
   "/"
   <span class="lststatus">
    New
   </span>
   ",
"
   <span class="lstupnew">

   "/"
   <span class="lststatus">
    Updated
   </span>
   ", or "
   <span class="lstdep">
    Deprecated
   </span>
   ". When the state of a tag entry has
changed in the current or immediately previous development cycle
the state will appear in
   <span class="lstnew">
    red
   </span>
   . Entries
whose state has gone unchanged through at least one full stable
release cycle will have their state displayed in "
   <span class="lststatus">
    black
   </span>
   ". Tag entries marked for deprecation will
marked in "
   <span class="lstdep">
    red
   </span>
   " until they are removed
from the PCGen Tag Dictionary.

   All the variables that can be used are

  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   Obsolete LST tag syntax is included here. When
the deprecated syntax represents a complete LST tag entry, a link
to the deprecated listing is provided. Were applicable, the version
in which the syntax was deprecated should be included as per the
'State of the Entry' information listed above.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Conversion Example
  </h3>
  <p class="indent0">
   Obsolete LST tag conversion examples are
