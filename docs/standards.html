<h1>
    Documentation Standards
</h1>
<p class="indent0">
    This page will be used to provide standards to
    follow in the creation of documentation pages for PCGen.
</p>
<h2>
    General Documentation Standards
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
</p>
<ol class="indent0">
    <li>
        Each page should have information commented in the page which
        should contain the names of those contributing to the creation and
        maintenance of the page. There should also be a brief description
        of the purpose of the page and in the case of LST File Tag Pages, a
        basic to how to create the specific LST Objects covered by that
        page.
    </li>
    <li>
        The documentation should, in general, document what PCGen, with
        its LST Tags and OS Tokens, DO. Instances of documenting what PCGen
        WONT do should be minimized.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    LST Tag Documentation Standards
</h2>
<p class="indent0">
    The following is a generic example of the format
    to be used when documenting LST tags. You can copy the code and use
    it as a starting point for new entries if you wish. Following the
    entry will be a detailed explanation of how the format is should be
    used.

<h3>
    Anchors
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    If you examine the source code you will see that
    the first line of the entry contains a named anchor next to the
    horizontal rule. This is so the entry can be linked to from the
    index and other relevant entries. The anchor name should match the
    tag name up to the first variable minus any symbols used. See the
    source code for examples
</p>
<h3>
    State of the entry
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    Some entries are labeled "
    <span class="lstnew">
    New
   </span>
    "/"
    <span class="lststatus">
    New
   </span>
    ",

    <span class="lstupnew">
    Updated
   </span>
    "/"
    <span class="lststatus">
    Updated
   </span>
    ", or "
    <span class="lstdep">
    Deprecated
   </span>
    ". When the state of a tag entry has
    changed in the current or immediately previous development cycle
    the state will appear in
    <span class="lstnew">
    red
   </span>
    . Entries
    whose state has gone unchanged through at least one full stable
    release cycle will have their state displayed in "
    <span class="lststatus">
    black
   </span>
    ". Tag entries marked for deprecation will
    marked in "
    <span class="lstdep">
    red
   </span>
    " until they are removed
    from the PCGen Tag Dictionary.

<h3>
    Tag Name
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    The tag name is entered with the whole structure
    and syntax demonstrated. The variables are indicated using the
    letter x, y and z. You can use u, v, w and other letters if
    needed.
</p>
<h3>
    Variables Used
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    All the variables that can be used are
    explained. Number variables can be standard numbers or formulas or
    other variables if the tags accepts them. Text variables accept
    text strings, names and other text forms. Property variables
    indicate that the variable must be one of several properties
    hardcoded into the program. These properties are usually presented
    in a list following the variable.
</p>
<h3>
    What it does
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    A complete explanation of the tag and its
    uses.
</p>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    Examples of the tag in as many variations as
    needed to demonstrate the variety of uses of the tag.
</p>
<h3>
    Deprecated Syntax
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    Obsolete LST tag syntax is included here. When
    the deprecated syntax represents a complete LST tag entry, a link
    to the deprecated listing is provided. Were applicable, the version
    in which the syntax was deprecated should be included as per the
    'State of the Entry' information listed above.
</p>
<h3>
    Conversion Example
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    Obsolete LST tag conversion examples are
    included here. The form of the example generally takes the form
    of:
    <br/>
    <code>old lst code</code>
    becomes
    <code>new lst
        code</code>
    .
</p>
<h3>
    Where it is used
</h3>
<p class="indent0">
    Some times it may be helpful to indicate exactly
    where the tag may be used. Most times this is indicated by the page
    the entry is found on.
