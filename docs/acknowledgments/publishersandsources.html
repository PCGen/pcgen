<h2><a name="datainclusion" id="datainclusion">PCGen Data Inclusion
    Policy and Procedure</a></h2>
<h3>Data Inclusion Policy</h3>
<p class="indent1">The following is PCGen&rsquo;s policy on
    including data for distribution.</p>
<ol class="indent1">
    <li><strong>Source Ownership:</strong> All source material is owned
        by the publishers. As such, PCGen shall comply with all publisher
        wishes as it relates to the use and distribution of the their
        source material in the form of PCGen datasets, whether the material
        is OGL, Closed Content, or a mixture of the same.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Publisher Agreements:</strong> All source datasets
        included within PCGen must be covered under a documented "Publisher
        Agreement" prior to being uploaded into the PCGen repository.
        Publisher Agreements shall include the list of sources covered
        under the agreement, the permissions being granted, general and
        specific, the type of publisher review required, the date the
        permissions were granted/last confirmed.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Minimum Permissions Level:</strong> All datasets
        distributed with PCGen must have as a minimum a granted permission
        level, from the appropriate publisher, of "OGL+Title". This will
        ensure that all data used within PCGen can be properly identified.
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>The only exception to this policy is where a dataset containing
                only OGL material,from a source where the publisher has granted
                'OGL Only' permission, and the dataset is used as the foundation
                for other permissioned source material. In this case, the 'OGL
                Only' source may be used, at the discretion of PCGen's Board of
                Directors, as an unidentified dataset to allow inclusion of the
                permissioned datasets.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Minimum Dataset Content:</strong> All game-mechanics
        associated with permissioned game elements, called objects within
        PCGen, found in a publishers source material (i.e. Abilities &amp;
        Feats, Classes, Equipment, Domains, Skills, Spells, and Races) are
        required for a dataset to be considered for inclusion in the PCGen
        Distribution.
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Object name. As per the RSRD vs the PHB/DMG/MM, the name can be
                different than the one used in the book. EXAMPLE: The <em>Quiver of
                    Elhonna</em> from the DMG, &copy;WotC 2003, and not released under
                the OGL as part of the RSRD, has been replaced within PCGen by the
                <em>Efficient Quiver</em>, &copy;PCGen 2001-2007, and released
                under the OGL as part of PCGen's RSRD dataset conversion.
            </li>
            <li>Access to any rule associated with a permissioned object. If a
                permissioned object description/mechanic includes data that is used
                for calculations of any sort, PCGen must have access to that data
                to allow the calculation and display of all the derived values for
                the game features. Examples of such data include weapon damage
                stats.
            </li>
            <li>Access to any rule associated with a non-permissioned object
                that is required to allow the proper use of an effected
                permissioned object. If a non-permissioned object
                description/mechanic includes data that is used for calculations of
                any sort within a permissioned object, PCGen must have access to
                the non-permissioned data to allow the calculation and display of
                all derived values for the game features.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Not Included in Datasets:</strong> PCGen will not
        incorporate the following in any distributed dataset, making owning
        the source necessary to use the dataset.
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>The description of any game mechanic, using the permissioned
                data soley for the calculations described above.
            </li>
            <li>'Fluff' content, i.e. detailed object description or
                story-line.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Data Inclusion Procedure</h3>
<p class="indent1">The following is the procedure to be followed
    for including a dataset in PCGen for distribution.</p>
<ol class="indent1" style="line-height: 1.5;">
    <li>PCGen&rsquo;s publisher liaison (PL) team contacts the
        publisher and asks for permission to include one or more of their
        sources in PCGen&rsquo;s distribution.
    </li>
    <li>If the publisher agrees, they will be asked if they wish to
        review the dataset priorto it&rsquo;s release.
    </li>
    <li>Data monkeys (DM) work on the dataset.</li>
    <li>When completed, the dataset will be reviewed by the OGL team to
        make sure that it complies with the OGL and with the
        publisher&rsquo;s declaration of PI and OGC.
    </li>
    <li>The dataset is reviewed by a data chimp as part of
        PCGen&rsquo;s internal quality control review.
    </li>
    <li>If a publisher review is not required go to step 10 below.</li>
    <li>The dataset is then provided to the publisher</li>
    <li>If the publisher deems it complete and ready for inclusion,
        then it will be added to PCGen&rsquo;s distribution.
    </li>
    <li>If the publisher has issues with the dataset, those issues are
        corrected, and the process repeats with step 5 above.
    </li>
    <li>The Content SB, Data 2nd, or Data Chimp reviews the set and
        decides whether the dataset should be released as "Production" or
        "Alpha".
    </li>
    <li>The dataset is entered into the repository for
        distribution.
    </li>
</ol>

        was one of the pioneers of 3rd-party d20 publishing under the OGL.
        From the start, MGEconcentrated on releasing adventures that were
        both challenging and entertaining, providing hours of fun for
        fantasy gamers everywhere. MGE later entered the sourcebook arena
        with various titles, including two highly-acclaimed books. Sadly,
        MGE had to close operations in 2004, ceasing all publication of d20
        products. On the plus side, the company reinvented itself, emerging
        as the award-winning (Games Magazine Game of the Year 2005)<a href=
