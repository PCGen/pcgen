This is so the entry can 			be linked to from the index and other relevant entries. The anchor name should 			match the tag name up to the first variable minus any symbols used. See the 			source code for examples</p>		<h3>State of the entry</h3>		<p>Some entries are labeled &quot;New&quot; or &quot;Updated&quot;. It is useful 			to label new tags with the version number that the tag became active.</p>		<h3>Tag Name</h3>		<p>The tag name is entered with the whole structure and syntax demonstrated. The 			variables are indicated using the letter x, y and z. You can use u, v, w and 			other letters if needed.</p>		<h3>Variables Used</h3>		<p>All the variables that can be used are explained. Number variables can be standard   		numbers or formulas or other variables if the tags accepts them. Text variables   		accept text strings, names and other text forms. Property variables indicate   		that the variable must be one of several properties hardcoded into the program. 		These properties are usualy presented in a list following the variable.</p>		<h3>What it does</h3>		<p>A complete explanation of the tag and its uses.</p>		<h3>Example</h3>		<p>Examples of the tag in as many variations as needed to demonstrate the variety 			of uses of the tag.</p>		<h3>Where it is used</h3>		<p>Some times it may be helpfull to indicate exactly where the tag may be used. 			Most times this is indicated by the page the entry is found on.</p>		<!-- <p class="cvsfooter">$Source: /cvsroot/pcgendocs/pcgendocs/docs/acknowledgments/standards.html,v $ ($Revision: 1.2 $) last updated $Date: 2004/07/27 05:27:27 $ by $Author: eddyanthony $</p> -->	</body></html>
