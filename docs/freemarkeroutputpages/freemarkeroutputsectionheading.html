  <h1>
   FreeMarker Output Support
  </h1>
  <p>
   Starting from version 6.03.00, PCGen has introduced support for
the
   <a href="http://freemarker.org/">
    FreeMarker
   </a>
   template
engine. FreeMarker is a tool to allow the generation of text files
based on templates.
  </p>
  <p>
   FreeMarker brings a powerful, rich language for the creation of
output sheets to PCGen. It has far greater capabilities than were
provided by PCGen's venerable output sheet language. These include
the ability to define macros and methods to include repeated
content as well as understandable looping and logic commands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The initial implementation of FreeMarker for PCGen provides all
of the capabilities of the old output sheet system with a series of
functions to access the old output sheet tokens. In the future we
will also provide an object based means of interacting with a
character being output. This will allow more flexible and data
driven output.
