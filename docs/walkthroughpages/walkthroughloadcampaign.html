   Loading Campaign Materials
  </h1>
  <p>
   The first thing the user will need to do once PCGen has been
launched is to load a set of source material data sets. PCGen
provides an extensive library of data sets from a broad range of
RPG publishers. Loading these sets can be accoplished in one of two
methods:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <a href="../menupages/sources/sourcesselectionoptions.html#basic">
    Basic
Mode
   </a>
   provides a selection of the more commonly used data sets
as preconfigured collections ready for loading. This mode also
allows the user to add their own preconfigured set through the
creation of a custom PCC file.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <a href="../menupages/sources/sourcesselectionoptions.html#advanced">
    Advanced
Mode
   </a>
   allows the experienced user access to the complete list of
available data sets and provides complete control over which sets
are loaded.
