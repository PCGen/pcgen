     When PCGen starts up it displays the PCGen splash screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     After it automatically disappears, you will see the PCGen
program window and will be on the
     <strong>
      Source Materials
     </strong>
     tab. [Tabs for the Source Material and Loaded Characters default to
the bottom of the screen.]

     First you should choose your desired Game Mode.

     Now you can load sources appropriate to your chosen Game
Mode/Campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Window is broken into 4 panes. The sources
     <strong>
      Available
     </strong>
     to be used with PCGen, the sources you
have
     <strong>
      Selected
     </strong>
     for use in Character Generation, the
     <strong>
      Source Info
     </strong>
     pane and the button pane.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
     <img alt="Loading Campaing Materials" src="../images/tabs/sourcematerial.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have never started PCGen before, the right hand
     <strong>
      Selected
     </strong>
     pane will be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     The upper-left
     <strong>
      Available
     </strong>
     frame is a tree of
publishers.
     <br/>
     Clicking the "+" sign next to a publisher will expand the tree and
show the subgroups for that publisher.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     When you select a source of interest, the information about the
source appears in the lower left
     <strong>
      Source Info
     </strong>
     frame.
    </p>
    <p>
     Click the
     <strong>
      Add
     </strong>
     ("&gt;") button at the top of the
upper left frame to add the selected source to the
     <strong>
      Selected
     </strong>
     pane. You can also double-click the
source to add it. You can also add all sources from a company or
setting by selecting the company/setting instead of the product and
then clicking the
     <strong>
      Add
     </strong>
     button or double clicking
the company/setting.
    </p>
    <p>
     If, for instance, you wanted to create a character for the
System Reference Document , you would expand the "SRD", and select
the "3.0 SRD".
    </p>
    <p>
     Do this for every source you need to build your character.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Note:
     </strong>
     If the character you want to build
requires information other than that found in the core player's
book, (i.e. it comes from a specific campaign world, has a prestige
class from a supplemental book, or equipment from a magazine
article) you will need to load the source which has this
information.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Once all the sources you need are in the upper right
     <strong>
      Selected
     </strong>
     pane, click the
     <strong>
      Load
     </strong>
     button in the lower right frame. This will load all sources in the
upper right
     <strong>
      Selected
     </strong>
     pane.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Loaded column in the
     <strong>
      Selected
     </strong>
     pane will
then change to "Y"
    </p>
    <p>
     Various pop ups may come up detailing some licensing information
and publisher information, just close those (you can also uncheck
the "show at start up" option, so that it only runs once).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     You may now create your new character.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   <strong>
    Optional:
   </strong>
   Before creating a
character, you may wish to examine and/or modify the settings PCGen
uses for all characters. This allows certaincommon "house rules" to
override official rules for a system. This can be found under the
   <a href="../menupages/settings/settingspreferencesoption.html">
    <strong>
     Settings-Preferences
    </strong>
   </a>
   menu.
