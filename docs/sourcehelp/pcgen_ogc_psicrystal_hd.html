	<p>The PCGen Open Gaming Content - Psicrystal Hit Dice dataset is designed to 
  	modify Psicrystals in the RSRD Psionics dataset so that they gain hit dice as 
  	the Master progresses in class levels.</p>

	<p>The need for this originates from certain interpretations of the Psicrystal 
  	rules which hold that Psicrystals gain hit dice as the Master progresses in 
  	class levels and by extension also gain feats every 3 levels and stat bumps 
  	every 4. The dataset was not coded in this way and the designers apparently 
  	never intended this, however no errata has been published to refute or clarify 
  	this interpretation. This set is provided for those who wish to play Psicrystals 
  	under this interpretation.</p>
	
	<p>This set must be loaded with the RSRD Psionics set or the RSRD Complete set 
  	(which includes Psionics). When loaded it adds Hit Dice (Monster Class Levels) 
  	equal to the masters Psionic class levels. It also adds a point to the feat 
  	pool at first, third and every three levels after. Every four levels it grants 
  	a 1 point increase to an attribute of the users choice.</p>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> An unmodified Psicrystal is granted Alertness as a virtual feat, this 
  	set disables that, Alertness must be purchased with a feat point if it is desired.</p>
	
	<h3>Additional Feature</h3>
	
	<p>The rules state that a Psicrystal has at least 4 Ranks in Spot, Listen, Move 
  	Silently, and Search even if it's Master does not. PCGen cannot implement this 
  	automatically so 4 temporary bonuses can be activated manually by the user to 
  	bring the ranks of these skills up to 4 if the Master is lacking. They can be 
  	found in the Temporary Bonuses sub-tab of the Inventory Tab under templates. 
  	Each starts with the name &quot;Psicrystal Skills&quot; and allows you to set 
  	the Rank from 1 to 4.</p>
