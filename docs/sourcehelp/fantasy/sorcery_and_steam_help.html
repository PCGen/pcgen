  <h3>
   Campaign Modes
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   Sorcery and Steam has two modes of use. The
first is Steampunk as Exotic. Firearms are Exotic weapons and the
technology presented in Sorcery and Steam is rare. The second is
the Full Steampunk Campaign. Firearms are common and are considered
simple weapons and steam technology exists throughout the campaign
world. In this mode there are slight differences in some of the
base classes as well as some class variants.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   If you are using the first mode, Steampunk as
Exotic, you need only load the main Sorcery and Steam dataset. If
you want to use the second mode you must load the main Sorcery and
Steam dataset as well as the optional Full Steampunk Campaign
dataset. This will re-type firearms into simple weapons and make
adjustments to the base classes. You must load both sources to
fully implement this mode.

  <h3>
   Guns as melee weapons
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   Firearms can be used as melee weapons by virtue
of the fact that they have some weight and would hurt should you be
smacked on the head with one. To provide game stats for this use
there are 3 items in the equipment list, Pistol (As Melee Weapon),
Musket (As Melee Weapon) and Musket (As Melee Weapon with Bayonet).
These items have no cost or weight but if they are added to your
character they will show up on the output sheet with the correct
stats for use as melee weapons. This is a work-around for the fact
that PCGen cannot now treat the same weapon as both ranged and
melee.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Classes
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Artificer
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   If there are any technical knowledge skills in
your custom files or from other sources that you feel should be
Artificer class skills you can .MOD them to add the Tech TYPE (for
example see Knowledge (Architecture and Engineering).MOD) and they
will become Artificer class skills.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Gun Glyph
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The Marksman class ability is listed under
Special Abilities but the benefit is not applied to the character
sheet unless an equipment mod is applied to the equipment item
itself. To do this right click on the firearm in the equipment list
and choose Create Custom Item, then choose Gun Glyph Weapon and buy
it. Once equipped the appropriate bonuses will appear on your
character sheet. The cost of the mod is free and the bonuses will
only benefit a Gun Glyph character so if another character uses the
item there is no bonus. This mod is meant to reflect class
abilities and do not change the condition of the item itself. Note
that the weapon mod only applies to the Gun the Gun Glyph
constructed to qualify for the class.
