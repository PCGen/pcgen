<h3>
    Campaign Modes
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Sorcery and Steam has two modes of use. The
    first is Steampunk as Exotic. Firearms are Exotic weapons and the
    technology presented in Sorcery and Steam is rare. The second is
    the Full Steampunk Campaign. Firearms are common and are considered
    simple weapons and steam technology exists throughout the campaign
    world. In this mode there are slight differences in some of the
    base classes as well as some class variants.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    If you are using the first mode, Steampunk as
    Exotic, you need only load the main Sorcery and Steam dataset. If
    you want to use the second mode you must load the main Sorcery and
    Steam dataset as well as the optional Full Steampunk Campaign
    dataset. This will re-type firearms into simple weapons and make
    adjustments to the base classes. You must load both sources to
    fully implement this mode.
</p>
<h3>
    Guns as melee weapons
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Firearms can be used as melee weapons by virtue
    of the fact that they have some weight and would hurt should you be
    smacked on the head with one. To provide game stats for this use
    there are 3 items in the equipment list, Pistol (As Melee Weapon),
    Musket (As Melee Weapon) and Musket (As Melee Weapon with Bayonet).
    These items have no cost or weight but if they are added to your
    character they will show up on the output sheet with the correct
    stats for use as melee weapons. This is a work-around for the fact
    that PCGen cannot now treat the same weapon as both ranged and
    melee.
</p>
<h3>
    Classes
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Artificer
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    If there are any technical knowledge skills in
    your custom files or from other sources that you feel should be
    Artificer class skills you can .MOD them to add the Tech TYPE (for
    example see Knowledge (Architecture and Engineering).MOD) and they
    will become Artificer class skills.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Gun Glyph
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The Marksman class ability is listed under
    Special Abilities but the benefit is not applied to the character
    sheet unless an equipment mod is applied to the equipment item
    itself. To do this right click on the firearm in the equipment list
    and choose Create Custom Item, then choose Gun Glyph Weapon and buy
    it. Once equipped the appropriate bonuses will appear on your
    character sheet. The cost of the mod is free and the bonuses will
    only benefit a Gun Glyph character so if another character uses the
    item there is no bonus. This mod is meant to reflect class
    abilities and do not change the condition of the item itself. Note
    that the weapon mod only applies to the Gun the Gun Glyph
    constructed to qualify for the class.
