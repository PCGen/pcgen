   </strong>
   : This is a campaign dataset, in
addition to loading data specific to Arcanis this set loads the
parts of the RSRD set used in an Arcanis campaign. You should not
load the RSRD complete set nor should you load the Basics, Advanced
or Psionics Partial sets with the Player's Guide to Arcanis set or
you will likely encounter problems. The Monster, Epic and Divine
Partial sets are not loaded by this set and are probably safe to
load in conjunction with the Player's Guide to Arcanis.

etc. just remember that the cost in each box is cumulative.

    Race
   </strong>
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   When you select your race, when you go to do
another function, it will prompt you for several items. If you
selected a race with a sub-race (Dwarf, Elorii, Val) it will prompt
you to select your sub-race first, then your region and sub-region.
If you selected a race without sub-races, you will be prompted for
your region and sub-region only.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    A Special Note on Vals
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Your Bloodranks are done through templates. To
select your first bloodrank, go to the Race tab. In the templates
sub-tab, select "First Bloodrank". After selecting it, you will be
prompted for your bloodline power selection. If you want to have
more bloodranks at the beginning, select Second Bloodrank, and
Third Bloodrank (if you are going that high). If you are using
point buy, just make sure that when you are buying your attributes,
you only spend the appropriate number of points. (only spend 24 if
you are buying a second bloodrank, 20 if you are buying 3
bloodranks). The program will prompt you to say that you haven't
spent all your points. It will allow you to continue even if you
didn't spend all your attribute points. Be careful, the program
will let you spend more points than you are allowed.
  </p>

   <strong>
    Deity
   </strong>
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   Make sure you select a Deity before adding any
class levels, feats, skills, etc., whether your class depends on
worshipping a specific deity or not. You never know when a class
feature might rely on what deity you are worshipping or when a
class won’t allow you to select it if you do not worship a
specific deity.
  </p>

   Regions and Sub-regions

  <p class="indent1">
   Currently the only regions listed are those from
the Player’s Guide.

   Known Issues

  <h3 class="indent1">
   Classes
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Clerics
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The Clerics of various deities are handled by subclasses. However,
despite attempts to make it so, the program does not limit you to
choosing a particular deity. So be good and choose the correct
deity for the cleric you create.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Cleric of Larissa
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The program will not force you to choose either the Pleasure or
Divination domains. You will have to do that yourself. Making the
program assign one actually assigns them both which causes other
issues. This is something that will hopefully be fixed in future
versions of PCGen.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Holy Judge of Nier
   </strong>
   <br/>
   When you reach 20th level, you will have to adjust the HP manually
to their max level.
   <br/>
   On the Summary tab, click the HP button and adjust the HP to equal
200 + (20 x your CON bonus)
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Paladin of Sarish
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Sarishan Steel Weapon: You will have to custom make and add the
weapon to your equipment ignoring cost on your own. Be advised,
this is only possible if you have the LARC loaded. Sarishan Steel
is not in the PgtA.
   <br/>
   To create the custom item, go to the Inventory tab, and the Gear
sub tab. Find the weapon you want. Right click it and choose
"Create Custom". Select Sarishan Steel from the options that show
up and click the "ADD" button. Click okay. Put a check mark in the
box in the lower right corner that says "Ignore Cost". Highlight
the custom item and click the "&gt;" button at the top to move it
over to the right hand panel. Congratulations! You are the proud
owner of a Sarishan Steel weapon.
  </p>
  <h3 class="indent1">
   Prestige Classes
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Gladiator
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Andabatae Style: Due to limitations in the program, the Andabatae
has to be it's own class. The rest are subclasses of the Gladiator
subclass. So just make sure you know which one you are going for
ahead of time.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Samnite style: The two Weapon Focus and
Specialization feats you gain from this style are coded in,
however, due to a bug in the program, only the Short Sword Focus
and Specialization feat will show up in the display. But if you
print a character sheet, both feats will show on there and it will
be factored into both weapons properly. If you are using 5.8 or
later, this may already be fixed.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Obsidian Sniper
   </strong>
   <br/>
   At 9th level, the program gives you Improved Critical (Shortbow)
and Superior Critical (Shortbow). Enhanced Critical is not an
actual feat and was printed in the PGtA erroneously.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Onaran Templar
   </strong>
   <br/>
   As of right now, the domain spells are not being added to the PCs
known spells automatically. Once you have attained fourth level you
will have to double click on the domain spells to add them to your
known spell list.
   <br/>
   The War domain is automatically added at 4th level, however, due to
a bug in the PCGen code, the feats from it are not added
automatically. You have to go to the Domains tab and deselect the
domain by highlighting it and pressing the Select button, then
reselecting it by highlighting it and pressing select. This is
slated to be fixed for PCGen 5.8.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Weapon Savant
   </strong>
   <br/>
   When you achieve the second level of the class, you get to finesse
all your weapons. However, if you were to take Weapon Finesse
afterwards (or before) you would get double your Dex bonus. Be good
and don’t do this.
  </p>
  <h3 class="indent1">
   Feats
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Sabbatical
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Due to program limitations, you will have to manually add the Skill
points to use from this feat. Under the Skills tab, type the new
appropriate skill total in the TOTAL SKILL POINTS LEFT box.
  </p>
  <h3 class="indent1">
   Equipment
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Lorica, Andrean Plate and Milandisian
Cuirass
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Due to inherent limitations in the PCGen code,
each of these is two separate armors. If you are not proficient
with the armor, use the regular version. If you are proficient with
it, use the (Proficient) version. If necessary, change the SELL
PERCENTAGE drop down box under the gear tab to sell back at 100
percent, sell it, then "repurchase" the proficient armor. Make sure
to remember to set the SELL PERCENTAGE drop down back to 50 when
you are done.
