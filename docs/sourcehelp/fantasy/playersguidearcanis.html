    </strong>
    : This is a campaign dataset, in
    addition to loading data specific to Arcanis this set loads the
    parts of the RSRD set used in an Arcanis campaign. You should not
    load the RSRD complete set nor should you load the Basics, Advanced
    or Psionics Partial sets with the Player's Guide to Arcanis set or
    you will likely encounter problems. The Monster, Epic and Divine
    Partial sets are not loaded by this set and are probably safe to
    load in conjunction with the Player's Guide to Arcanis.

<p class="indent2">

    5.Click in each box under the "Cost" column and adjust each ability
    score accordingly (8 should be 0, 9 should be 1, 10 should be 2,
    etc. just remember that the cost in each box is cumulative.
    <br/>
    6.Click the "New" button.
    <br/>
    7.Type a name you will remember (I used Living Arcanis) then put 32
    in the "points" box.
    <br/>

        Race
    </strong>
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    When you select your race, when you go to do
    another function, it will prompt you for several items. If you
    selected a race with a sub-race (Dwarf, Elorii, Val) it will prompt
    you to select your sub-race first, then your region and sub-region.
    If you selected a race without sub-races, you will be prompted for
    your region and sub-region only.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        A Special Note on Vals
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Your Bloodranks are done through templates. To
    select your first bloodrank, go to the Race tab. In the templates
    sub-tab, select "First Bloodrank". After selecting it, you will be
    prompted for your bloodline power selection. If you want to have
    more bloodranks at the beginning, select Second Bloodrank, and
    Third Bloodrank (if you are going that high). If you are using
    point buy, just make sure that when you are buying your attributes,
    you only spend the appropriate number of points. (only spend 24 if
    you are buying a second bloodrank, 20 if you are buying 3
    bloodranks). The program will prompt you to say that you haven't
    spent all your points. It will allow you to continue even if you
    didn't spend all your attribute points. Be careful, the program
    will let you spend more points than you are allowed.
</p>

    <strong>
        Deity
    </strong>
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Make sure you select a Deity before adding any
    class levels, feats, skills, etc., whether your class depends on
    worshipping a specific deity or not. You never know when a class
    feature might rely on what deity you are worshipping or when a
    class won’t allow you to select it if you do not worship a
    specific deity.

    Regions and Sub-regions

<p class="indent1">
    Currently the only regions listed are those from
    the Player’s Guide.

<h3 class="indent1">
    Classes
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Clerics
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The Clerics of various deities are handled by subclasses. However,
    despite attempts to make it so, the program does not limit you to
    choosing a particular deity. So be good and choose the correct
    deity for the cleric you create.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Cleric of Larissa
    </strong>
    <br/>
    The program will not force you to choose either the Pleasure or
    Divination domains. You will have to do that yourself. Making the
    program assign one actually assigns them both which causes other
    issues. This is something that will hopefully be fixed in future
    versions of PCGen.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Holy Judge of Nier
    </strong>
    <br/>
    When you reach 20th level, you will have to adjust the HP manually
    to their max level.
    <br/>
    On the Summary tab, click the HP button and adjust the HP to equal
    200 + (20 x your CON bonus)
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Paladin of Sarish
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Sarishan Steel Weapon: You will have to custom make and add the
    weapon to your equipment ignoring cost on your own. Be advised,
    this is only possible if you have the LARC loaded. Sarishan Steel
    is not in the PgtA.
    <br/>
    To create the custom item, go to the Inventory tab, and the Gear
    sub tab. Find the weapon you want. Right click it and choose
    "Create Custom". Select Sarishan Steel from the options that show
    up and click the "ADD" button. Click okay. Put a check mark in the
    box in the lower right corner that says "Ignore Cost". Highlight
    the custom item and click the "&gt;" button at the top to move it
    over to the right hand panel. Congratulations! You are the proud
    owner of a Sarishan Steel weapon.
</p>

    Prestige Classes
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Gladiator
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Andabatae Style: Due to limitations in the program, the Andabatae
    has to be it's own class. The rest are subclasses of the Gladiator
    subclass. So just make sure you know which one you are going for
    ahead of time.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Samnite style: The two Weapon Focus and
    Specialization feats you gain from this style are coded in,
    however, due to a bug in the program, only the Short Sword Focus
    and Specialization feat will show up in the display. But if you
    print a character sheet, both feats will show on there and it will
    be factored into both weapons properly. If you are using 5.8 or
    later, this may already be fixed.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Obsidian Sniper
    </strong>
    <br/>
    At 9th level, the program gives you Improved Critical (Shortbow)
    and Superior Critical (Shortbow). Enhanced Critical is not an
    actual feat and was printed in the PGtA erroneously.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Onaran Templar
    </strong>
    <br/>
    As of right now, the domain spells are not being added to the PCs
    known spells automatically. Once you have attained fourth level you
    will have to double click on the domain spells to add them to your
    known spell list.
    <br/>
    The War domain is automatically added at 4th level, however, due to
    a bug in the PCGen code, the feats from it are not added
    automatically. You have to go to the Domains tab and deselect the
    domain by highlighting it and pressing the Select button, then
    reselecting it by highlighting it and pressing select. This is
    slated to be fixed for PCGen 5.8.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Weapon Savant
    </strong>
    <br/>
    When you achieve the second level of the class, you get to finesse
    all your weapons. However, if you were to take Weapon Finesse
    afterwards (or before) you would get double your Dex bonus. Be good
    and don’t do this.
</p>
<h3 class="indent1">
    Feats
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Sabbatical
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Due to program limitations, you will have to manually add the Skill
    points to use from this feat. Under the Skills tab, type the new
    appropriate skill total in the TOTAL SKILL POINTS LEFT box.
</p>
<h3 class="indent1">
    Equipment
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Lorica, Andrean Plate and Milandisian
        Cuirass
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Due to inherent limitations in the PCGen code,
    each of these is two separate armors. If you are not proficient
    with the armor, use the regular version. If you are proficient with
    it, use the (Proficient) version. If necessary, change the SELL
    PERCENTAGE drop down box under the gear tab to sell back at 100
    percent, sell it, then "repurchase" the proficient armor. Make sure
    to remember to set the SELL PERCENTAGE drop down back to 50 when
    you are done.
