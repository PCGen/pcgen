<h3>
    The Midnight magic system
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Midnight employs an unusual magic system which
    has been difficult to implement in PCGen and accounts for the long
    time it took to appear in the release. In Midnight any character
    class can learn and cast spells, they need only have taken the
    proper feats. To do this some workarounds are employed to make this
    work within PCGen. First all the normally non-spellcasting classes
    allowed in Midnight are modified so that they are spell casters.
    This is only done for the classes which exist in Midnight, those
    classes which do not were left alone. Second the Spells have been
    modified so that they have as a prerequisite the correct feats
    necessary to learn and cast the spell.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    One effect of this is that when the Midnight
    dataset is loaded all the spells in the SRD have prerequisites for
    Midnight's requirements which interferes with spellcasters outside
    of those in Midnight. If you wish to make NPC's and monsters with
    spellcasting capabilities outside of the Midnight system we have
    provided a template named
    <strong>
        Unlock Midnight Spell
        Prerequisites
    </strong>
    which will bypass those prerequisites and
    allow normal spellcasting.
