  <h3>
   The Midnight magic system
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   Midnight employs an unusual magic system which
has been difficult to implement in PCGen and accounts for the long
time it took to appear in the release. In Midnight any character
class can learn and cast spells, they need only have taken the
proper feats. To do this some workarounds are employed to make this
work within PCGen. First all the normally non-spellcasting classes
allowed in Midnight are modified so that they are spell casters.
This is only done for the classes which exist in Midnight, those
classes which do not were left alone. Second the Spells have been
modified so that they have as a prerequisite the correct feats
necessary to learn and cast the spell.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   One effect of this is that when the Midnight
dataset is loaded all the spells in the SRD have prerequisites for
Midnight's requirements which interferes with spellcasters outside
of those in Midnight. If you wish to make NPC's and monsters with
spellcasting capabilities outside of the Midnight system we have
provided a template named
   <strong>
    Unlock Midnight Spell
Prerequisites
   </strong>
   which will bypass those prerequisites and
allow normal spellcasting.
