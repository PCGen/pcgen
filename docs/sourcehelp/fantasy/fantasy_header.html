<p class="indent1">
    The 3e and 35e gameModes represent the third
    edition and the 3.5 edition of the fantasy role playing game
    published by Wizards of the Coast. Our datasets are based on the
    version of this game published under the Open Gaming License
    commonly known as the
    <a href="srd_help.html">
        Standard Reference
        Document or SRD
    </a>
    . The rules were recently revised and that
    version is known as the
    <a href="rsrd_help.html">
        (Revised) Standard
        reference Document or RSRD
    </a>
    . All of the datasets which appear in
    the sources tab along with the SRD and RSRD are dependent on having
    these loaded and will not function properly without them.
