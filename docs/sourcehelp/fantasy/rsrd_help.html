   The (Revised) System Reference Document, or RSRD, contains the
core rules for the d20 fantasy role playing game published by
Wizards of the Coast under the Open Gaming License and contains
much of the material found in the three core books and the Psionics
supplement.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Loading the RSRD
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   To load the RSRD set you have three options, you
can load the 3.5 RSRD Complete set, you can load the 3.5 RSRD
Basics set and any of the other Partial 3.5 RSRD sets or you can
load one (and only one) of the campaign sets. You should not load
the 3.5 RSRD Complete set and any of the Partial sets or Campaign
sets at the same time because it is basically loading the same data
twice. If you load any of the Partial sets keep in mind that the
3.5 RSRD Basics set is required for any of the other Partial sets.
The Partial sets are designed to allow you to pick and choose which
options you wish to include while the Campaign sets are designed to
facilitate a specific style of play. When using a Campaign set do
not load any other RSRD sets with it.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The basics set contains objects which are called
from more than one of the other sets for example it includes
Monster Classes and Magical Enhancement Equipment Modifiers, this
is to keep things simplified but it does mean that the Basics set
contains material found in other sections of the RSRD and is not
necessarily limited to material found in the Core Rule Book. This
is one reason the Campaign sets were created. A word of caution:
because the Core Book I Campaign set contains only material found
in Core Book I you may experience problems if this is loaded with a
third party dataset which requires objects (such as Monster Classes
and Magical Enhancement Equipment Modifiers) not included in
it.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Class Features
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Arcane Archer
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The Arcane Archer has the ability to enchant any
non-magical arrow notched in his bow. This feature cannot be
automatically enabled in PCGen. To have the effects of this feature
activated you must customize a non-magical arrow with the Arcane
Archer Enhancement equipment modifier. Ammo with this EQMOD applied
to it and loaded in a bow will display the proper bonuses for the
Arcane Archers level. A PC with no levels of Arcane Archer will
gain no benefit.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Domains
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   Some Domains grant Casterlevel bonuses to spells
of Certain Schools, Subschools or Descriptors as detailed in the
Domains description. These bonuses are not active by default
because of a limitation within PCGen. Domains are class abilities
and the casterlevel bonuses should only apply to spells granted
from the same class granting the Domain. PCGen cannot limit this
and will apply a bonus to any qualifying spell regardless of what
class it comes from. For example if you create a Cleric/Wizard with
the Knowledge Domain it would grant a +1 Casterlevel bonus to all
Divination spells Cleric and Wizard alike. We have provided a way
to activate these bonuses, Under Settings -&gt; Preferences -&gt;
House Rules you will find the rule "Apply Casterlevel Bonuses from
Domains to Spells". Checking this box will activate these bonuses.
Note that if your character does not have spells from other classes
you will not be breaking any rules.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Some Domains grant certain skills as class
skills, be aware that these class skills are applied to the Cleric
class only.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Templates
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Awakened Animal
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The Awakened Animal template can be applied to
any animal on which the spell Awaken has been cast. All the effects
of the spell are implemented including the random stat adjustments
to the Animals Intelligence and Charisma. However if you remove the
template the stats will not revert back, you will need to manually
change them back to where they were. You will also need to remove
the language added by the template and any skill points spent on
skill ranks.
