<p>
    The (Revised) System Reference Document, or RSRD, contains the
    core rules for the d20 fantasy role playing game published by
    Wizards of the Coast under the Open Gaming License and contains
    much of the material found in the three core books and the Psionics
    supplement.
</p>
<h2>
    Loading the RSRD
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    To load the RSRD set you have three options, you
    can load the 3.5 RSRD Complete set, you can load the 3.5 RSRD
    Basics set and any of the other Partial 3.5 RSRD sets or you can
    load one (and only one) of the campaign sets. You should not load
    the 3.5 RSRD Complete set and any of the Partial sets or Campaign
    sets at the same time because it is basically loading the same data
    twice. If you load any of the Partial sets keep in mind that the
    3.5 RSRD Basics set is required for any of the other Partial sets.
    The Partial sets are designed to allow you to pick and choose which
    options you wish to include while the Campaign sets are designed to
    facilitate a specific style of play. When using a Campaign set do
    not load any other RSRD sets with it.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The basics set contains objects which are called
    from more than one of the other sets for example it includes
    Monster Classes and Magical Enhancement Equipment Modifiers, this
    is to keep things simplified but it does mean that the Basics set
    contains material found in other sections of the RSRD and is not
    necessarily limited to material found in the Core Rule Book. This
    is one reason the Campaign sets were created. A word of caution:
    because the Core Book I Campaign set contains only material found
    in Core Book I you may experience problems if this is loaded with a
    third party dataset which requires objects (such as Monster Classes
    and Magical Enhancement Equipment Modifiers) not included in
    it.
</p>
<h2>
    Class Features
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Arcane Archer
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The Arcane Archer has the ability to enchant any
    non-magical arrow notched in his bow. This feature cannot be
    automatically enabled in PCGen. To have the effects of this feature
    activated you must customize a non-magical arrow with the Arcane
    Archer Enhancement equipment modifier. Ammo with this EQMOD applied
    to it and loaded in a bow will display the proper bonuses for the
    Arcane Archers level. A PC with no levels of Arcane Archer will
    gain no benefit.
</p>
<h2>
    Domains
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    Some Domains grant Casterlevel bonuses to spells
    of Certain Schools, Subschools or Descriptors as detailed in the
    Domains description. These bonuses are not active by default
    because of a limitation within PCGen. Domains are class abilities
    and the casterlevel bonuses should only apply to spells granted
    from the same class granting the Domain. PCGen cannot limit this
    and will apply a bonus to any qualifying spell regardless of what
    class it comes from. For example if you create a Cleric/Wizard with
    the Knowledge Domain it would grant a +1 Casterlevel bonus to all
    Divination spells Cleric and Wizard alike. We have provided a way
    to activate these bonuses, Under Settings -&gt; Preferences -&gt;
    House Rules you will find the rule "Apply Casterlevel Bonuses from
    Domains to Spells". Checking this box will activate these bonuses.
    Note that if your character does not have spells from other classes
    you will not be breaking any rules.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Some Domains grant certain skills as class
    skills, be aware that these class skills are applied to the Cleric
    class only.
</p>
<h2>
    Templates
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Awakened Animal
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The Awakened Animal template can be applied to
    any animal on which the spell Awaken has been cast. All the effects
    of the spell are implemented including the random stat adjustments
    to the Animals Intelligence and Charisma. However if you remove the
    template the stats will not revert back, you will need to manually
    change them back to where they were. You will also need to remove
    the language added by the template and any skill points spent on
    skill ranks.
