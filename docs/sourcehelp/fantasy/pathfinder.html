   A number of non-player characters from this
source can be generated from kits included in the dataset. Create a
new character and click the Add Kit/Create Monster button, in the
list of kits you will find a set of kits which starts with "NPC"
followed by the name of the character in parentheses. All the
monsters introduced in this book can also be generated with a
Default Monster Kit as well.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Some characters are unique creations and
required custom templates to grant the abilities specified by the
books authors. For example the character Koruvus is a goblin which
has been mutated by the Waters of Lamashtu which made him medium
size and give him the ability to spit acid among other abilities.
To account for this a template was created named "Waters of
Lamashtu (Koruvus's Mutation)" which if removed will restore the
character to a more normal goblin (which is a possible outcome in
the scenario).

  <p class="indent1">
   Not all the NPC's are included because some were
created using closed content and cannot be recreated in PCGen.
