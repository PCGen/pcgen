<p class="indent1">
    A number of non-player characters from this
    source can be generated from kits included in the dataset. Create a
    new character and click the Add Kit/Create Monster button, in the
    list of kits you will find a set of kits which starts with "NPC"
    followed by the name of the character in parentheses. All the
    monsters introduced in this book can also be generated with a
    Default Monster Kit as well.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Some characters are unique creations and
    required custom templates to grant the abilities specified by the
    books authors. For example the character Koruvus is a goblin which
    has been mutated by the Waters of Lamashtu which made him medium
    size and give him the ability to spit acid among other abilities.
    To account for this a template was created named "Waters of
    Lamashtu (Koruvus's Mutation)" which if removed will restore the
    character to a more normal goblin (which is a possible outcome in
    the scenario).
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Not all the NPC's are included because some were
    created using closed content and cannot be recreated in PCGen.
