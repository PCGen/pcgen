    PCGen Source Help
</h1>
<p>
    This section will provide information on how to use specific
    datasets. It is not intended to detail every aspect of the dataset
    but is specifically focused on features and aspects of the dataset
    which are hidden, obscure, counter intuitive or simply
    unimplemented. When it is not obvious how a particular feature from
    a source book is handled by PCGen we will include that information
    here. If a feature can not currently be supported in PCGen we will
    use this section to let you know and include suggestions on how to
    work around the problem. For more general instructions on how to
    use the program you should read the
    <a href="../walkthroughpages/walkthroughsectionheading.html">
        Character
        Creation Walkthrough
    </a>
    section which includes a step by step
    tutorial on how to create a character.
</p>
<p>
    An example of a feature which would be included in this section
    is the Arcane Archer. The Arcane Archer has the ability to enchant
    any non-magical arrow he notches in his bow, this feature is not
    easily done within PCGen data and there is no way to have it
    accounted for automatically. The current solution is a special
    equipment modifier created for this purpose. To use this feature
    you must customize a non-magical arrow and add this equipment
    modifier to it, it costs nothing and only grants bonuses to an
    Arcane Archer but when used by an Arcane Archer the appropriate
    bonuses appear on the character sheets. Because of the unusual (and
    some what obscure) way this feature is implemented it is detailed
    here.
</p>
<p>
    Another example is a class ability of the Archmage. As the
    Archmage gains levels he is given the option to choose a spell he
    knows and thereafter use it as a spell-like ability. PCGen at this
    time does not have the capability to choose a spell from the
    characters spell list and display it within the SA text. The
    suggested work around is to record your spell choices in a note in
    the description tab.
