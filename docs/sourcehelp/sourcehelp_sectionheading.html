   PCGen Source Help
  </h1>
  <p>
   This section will provide information on how to use specific
datasets. It is not intended to detail every aspect of the dataset
but is specifically focused on features and aspects of the dataset
which are hidden, obscure, counter intuitive or simply
unimplemented. When it is not obvious how a particular feature from
a source book is handled by PCGen we will include that information
here. If a feature can not currently be supported in PCGen we will
use this section to let you know and include suggestions on how to
work around the problem. For more general instructions on how to
use the program you should read the
   <a href="../walkthroughpages/walkthroughsectionheading.html">
    Character
Creation Walkthrough
   </a>
   section which includes a step by step
tutorial on how to create a character.
  </p>
  <p>
   An example of a feature which would be included in this section
is the Arcane Archer. The Arcane Archer has the ability to enchant
any non-magical arrow he notches in his bow, this feature is not
easily done within PCGen data and there is no way to have it
accounted for automatically. The current solution is a special
equipment modifier created for this purpose. To use this feature
you must customize a non-magical arrow and add this equipment
modifier to it, it costs nothing and only grants bonuses to an
Arcane Archer but when used by an Arcane Archer the appropriate
bonuses appear on the character sheets. Because of the unusual (and
some what obscure) way this feature is implemented it is detailed
here.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another example is a class ability of the Archmage. As the
Archmage gains levels he is given the option to choose a spell he
knows and thereafter use it as a spell-like ability. PCGen at this
time does not have the capability to choose a spell from the
characters spell list and display it within the SA text. The
suggested work around is to record your spell choices in a note in
the description tab.
