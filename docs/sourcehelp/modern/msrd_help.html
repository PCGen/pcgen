   The Modern System Reference Document, or MSRD, contains the core
rules for the Modern d20 role playing game published by Wizards of
the Coast under the Open Gaming License and contains much of the
material found in the core book.

  <h2>
   Loading the MSRD
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   To load the MSRD set you always have to load at
least the Basics. You have two options for that: you can load the
complete MSRD Basics set, which contains all the sets from the MSRD
&gt; PARTIAL &gt; BASICS section, or you can load just the partial
Modern Basics set from that section. Other than that you can mix
and match the complete section sets with the partial sets as you
like, but you should not load a Complete section set and any of the
Partial sets from that very section at the same time because it is
basically loading the same data twice.
  </p>
  <h2>
   General Issues
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Wealth
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The Wealth system in the MSRD is not fully
implemented within
   <strong>
    PCGen
   </strong>
   , though it is fairly easy
to work around the limitations. When adding the first level of a
base class you are prompted to choose the result of your starting
wealth roll which you will need to make manually. This roll is
added to any bonuses granted from your starting occupation and/or
feats which may effect Wealth and that is your Starting Wealth
Score. The starting Wealth Score and Current Wealth Score are
displayed on the Abilities Tab in the Special Abilities window and
on the Special Abilities Block of the OS. Your Current Wealth Score
is displayed in the lower right pane of the Class Tab as well as on
the first page of the OS. Since Wealth is fluid and can change
based on circumstances within the game a Temporary Bonus exists
named Wealth Adjustment which allows you to do exactly that. You
will find this in the Temporary Bonus Sub-Tab of the Inventory Tab
under Templates. You can apply a modifier from 10 to -10, if you
need more or there is more than one adjustment to make you can
apply the Wealth Adjustment as many times as is needed. Wealth
Adjustment is applied to the Current Wealth Score and leaves the
Starting Wealth Score untouched.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Buying stuff.
   <strong>
    PCGen
   </strong>
   does not
yet support the abstract wealth system presented in the Modern
rules. As a work around we use the COST attribute to hold the
Purchase DC of the item instead of its monetary value. You should
check the box marked 'Ignore Cost', consult the Purchase DC of the
item and your Current Wealth Score and make your rolls
manually.
  </p>
  <p class="new">
   *** Updated 5.9.5
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Action Points
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Action Points are now granted automatically by
the class that provides them. Modification of the Action Points is
still done on the
   <i>
    Temporary Bonus Sub-Tab
   </i>
   of the
   <i>
    Inventory Tab
   </i>
   . There are now two temporary modifiers named
   <strong>
    Used Action Points
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Bonus Action
Points
   </strong>
   , which can be used to modify a character's Action
Points.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The
   <strong>
    Used Action Points
   </strong>
   tracker
is to be applied if you spend Action Points. It records APs as
spent and thus reduces the amount of available ones. The
   <strong>
    Bonus Action Points
   </strong>
   tracker can be used, if you
should get Action Points from an unexpected source, like a GM
handing out Bonus APs or some House Rule of yours. Your remaining
Action Points will then be automatically calculated from the
difference of gained and spent Action Points. Both can be applied
multiple times.
  </p>
  <p class="new">
   *** Updated 5.13.11
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Languages
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Unlike the fantasy game, Modern does not grant
bonus languages based on the characters Intelligence Mod, however
up until version 5.13.11 this rule was erronously implemented. This
has been corrected and in addition there is no longer a pop up
selector to choose the charatcers native language. Instead all
characters are granted 1 bonus language which represents the native
language and can be chosen at any time from the Language, Weapon
Prof &amp; SA window.

   Classes

  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Smart Hero
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Because of limitations with the
   <strong>
    PCGen
   </strong>
   code the Smart Hero's
   <strong>
    Linguist
   </strong>
   talent will not appear as a talent choice
at first level. If you want to select it at first level anyway,
instead of selecting a talent, close the
   <i>
    Feat Choice
   </i>
   window
without making a selection, add the necessary ranks in the
Read/Write Language and Speak Language skills on the
   <i>
    Skills
tab
   </i>
   , and select
   <strong>
    Linguist
   </strong>
   as one of the feats
on the
   <i>
    Feats tab
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <h2>
   Equipment
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Firearms and Ammunition
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Ammunition is sold in bundles, the number of
which depends on the type. In
   <strong>
    PCGen
   </strong>
   you will find
two versions of each ammo, one is a bundle in which it is sold and
one is a single projectile. The two versions are identical accept
for the name, the Buy DC listed is always for the bundle, you can't
buy single bullets. The single projectile version exists for the
convenience of being able to add an exact amount of these items to
the character sheet, they will appear on the sheet with check boxes
handy for tracking spent ammo. You can also load bullets into
firearms in the Equipping Tab and checkboxes will appear under the
firearms listing in the main Equipment Block.

  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Weapon Accessories
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Some weapon accessories only make sense when
attached to a weapon. For that matter the
   <i>
    Illuminator
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    Laser Sight
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    Standard Scope
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    Electro-optical
Scope
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    Speed Loader
   </i>
   , and
   <i>
    Suppressor
   </i>
   were not
included as equipment in
   <strong>
    PCGen
   </strong>
   , but as equipment
modifiers. To use one of these items you have to select the weapon
you want to apply the item to and customize it. To do so,
right-click the weapon and select "
   <i>
    Create custom item
   </i>
   " in
the menu. This will open the "
   <i>
    Item Customizer
   </i>
   ", where you
can select the modifiers you want to attach to your weapon.
