    The Future section of the Modern System Reference Document, or
    MSRD, contains the Future rules for the Modern d20 role playing
    game published by Wizards of the Coast under the Open Gaming
    License and contains much of the material found in the Future
    supplement.

<h2>
    Loading the MSRD Future parts
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    To load the MSRD Future set you also need to
    load the MSRD Basics. You have two options to accomplish this,
    either you can load the Complete MSRD - Basics set (including FX
    and Creatures material) or you can load the Partial Modern - Basics
    set and maybe add some of the other Partial Modern sets to that. To
    that selection you either add the Complete MSRD - Future set or
    only those parts of the MSRD Future section you desire to use. You
    should not load a Complete section set and any of the Partial sets
    from that very section at the same time because it is basically
    loading the same data twice. The partial Future - Basics set
    contains almost all classes, feats, and occupations, the partial
    Future - Equipment set includes personal gear, starships, and
    vehicles, the other names should be self-explanatory.

    All these classes offer the feat Aircraft
    Operation as one of their possible Bonus Feats, but limit that feat
    to the selection of
    <i>

    if taken as a Bonus Feat.
    Since PCGen cannot limit this selection at the time, you will have
    to make sure to take heed of this restriction on your own.

    feasible within
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    to limit the selection of

    Purchase DCs
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    For most items the
    <i>
        Purchase DC
    </i>
    will be
    shown in the Cost field, but we have a problem with the
    <i>
        Purchase
        DC
    </i>
    s of items that get applied to a piece of equipment (anything
    that only shows in the window that pops up when you customize a
    piece of equipment) if it doesn't add to the base item's
    <i>
        Purchase DC
    </i>
    but calls for an additional
    <i>
        Wealth check
    </i>
    .
    In these cases the
    <i>
        Purchase DC
    </i>
    cannot be added to the base
    item and will not show up at all in
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    . It
    would have been possible to list the additional
    <i>
        Purchase DCs
    </i>
    in the special properties of the item it gets applied to, but many
    of these (especially starships) are already quite filled with
    different informations, so we decided against that. Please look up
    these
    <i>
        Purchase DC
    </i>
    s in the
    <strong>
        <i>
            Future

<h2>
    Gadgets
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Alternate Weapon Gadget
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    It is not really possible to code this gadget
    with the current limitations of
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    . You can
    apply this equipment modifier to a weapon by creating a custom
    item, but all it will do is put the name of the linked alternate
    weapon into the weapon's special properties. You still have to buy
    the alternate weapon (you'd have to pay for it anyway) and equip it
    as carried. Because there is no real link between the two weapons,
    it is currently not possible to have both of them equipped to the
    same hand or let them take up 1 space in a container.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Autoloader Module Gadget
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The Autoloader Module Gadget is only allowed to
    be equipped to weapons that have box magazines or power packs for
    ammo feed. At this time we cannot test for the ammo feed of a
    weapon, you will therefore have to pay attention to this detail on
    your own, when applying this gadget.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Booby Trapped Gadget
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    To be eligible to add this gadget to your
    weapon, you
    <strong>
        must
    </strong>
    apply the
    <i>
        Alternate Weapon
        Gadget
    </i>
    first.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Satellite Datalink Gadget
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    This Gadget should be restricted to being
    applied to
    <i>
        gear containing computerized communications
        equipment
    </i>
    , but it is currently set up to allow items that have
    the types electronic and surveillance applied to them. While this
    mostly covers the items of the wanted category, there are a few
    items included that don't make much sense for this gadget, so take
    heed at what item you add this gadget to.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Storage Compartment Gadget
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    All this gadget will currently do is to show up
    in the item name. At this time we cannot change a piece of
    equipment into a container afterwards.
    <strong>
        You will not gain
        any functionality from this!
    </strong>
</p>
<h2>
    Starships
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    You put a starship on the vehicle slot of your
    character. Only when applied there, you will see all the bonuses
    and effects that pertain to your starship. At the time you equip
    the starship to the vehicle slot, you may also get additional
    equipment granted to your character (e.g. the starship's weapons).
    Every piece of starship equipment gained this way should be
    equipped to
    <i>
        not carried
    </i>
    .
</p>
<h2>
    Starship Weapons
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    To add weapons to a starship you customize said
    starship and add those equipment modifiers to it, which provide the
    wanted weapon. When you equip your customized starship to the
    <i>
        Vehicle
    </i>
    slot of your character, these equipment modifiers
    will automatically add the starship weapons to your character (like
    personal weapons), but they will be unequipped and you should equip
    them to
    <i>
        not carried
    </i>
    as location. This will only work with
    the existing weapons that come from the sample starships in the
    MSRD Future. If you want to have weapons in your starship that were
    customized themselves, you can build and add these to your
    character, but there is no way to have them show up as part of your
    starship. As a workaround, you can hand edit the special properties
    of your starship and put in a reference to the weapon there.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Fire-linked Weapons
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    At this time we are not capable of supplying you
    with an equipment modifier for
    <i>
        fire-linked weapons
    </i>
    ,
    therefore you will not be able to simply customize a single
    starship weapon into groups of
    <i>
        fire-linked weapons
    </i>
    . You will
    therefore be limited to those
    <i>
        fire-linked weapons
    </i>
    that are
    included in the dataset.

    Purchase DCs
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    The problems about
    <i>
        Purchase DC
    </i>
    described
    under Equipment pertain here as well.
    <i>
        Purchase DC
    </i>
    s of items
    that get applied to a piece of equipment or
    <strong>
        Mecha

    (anything that only shows in the window that pops up when you
    customize a piece of equipment or
    <strong>
        Mecha

    ) if it
    doesn't add to the base item's
    <i>
        Purchase DC

    but calls for an
    additional
    <i>
        Wealth check
    </i>
    cannot be added to the base item and
    will not show up at all in
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    . It would have
    been possible to list the additional
    <i>
        Purchase DCs
    </i>
    in the
    special properties of the item or
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    it gets
    applied to, but many of these are already quite filled with
    different informations, so we decided against that. Please look up
    these
    <i>
        Purchase DC
    </i>
    s in the
    <strong>
        <i>
            Future

    </strong>
    section of the
    <strong>
        MSRD
    </strong>
    .
</p>
<h2>
    Equipment Slots
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    Most equipment that gets applied to a
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    needs to go to a predetermined equipment
    slot. With the current
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    code limitations it
    is not possible to do that. You will find the information which
    slot a piece of equipment may go to in the special properties, so
    you can check the correctness, but there is no way to enforce this.
    If you build a custom
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    , you should do this
    outside of
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    and then customize the basic
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    entries according to the built up that you
    already determined.
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    is not the proper tool
    to do that planning, it will just allow to record your
    results.
</p>
<h2>
    Equipping Mecha Weapons
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    There are two ways to equip a weapon to a
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    :
    <i>
        hand held
    </i>
    or
    <i>
        built-in
    </i>
    . To
    equip a weapon
    <i>
        hand held
    </i>
    to a
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    , you
    just buy the weapon and equip it to your character. To equip a
    <i>
        built-in
    </i>
    weapon to a
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    , you need to
    customize the
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    and add the
    <i>
        equipment
        modifier
    </i>
    to it, that corresponds with the chosen weapon. The
    <i>
        equipment modifier
    </i>
    will then add the weapon itself to your
    character, which you should equip as
    <i>
        not carried
    </i>
    . If you
    remove the
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    from your equipment later, that
    will not automatically remove the
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    weapons as
    well, so you will be required to remove those yourself.
</p>
<h2>
    Piloting a Mecha
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    If you look at the rules for
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    , you will see that these are more of a
    hybrid game element, being so constituted that they include
    elements from equipment as well as creature templates. To
    effectively reproduce this in
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    , you will have
    to add not only the chosen
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    from the
    <i>
        Equipment
    </i>
    tab, but also the
    <strong>
        Mecha Pilot
    </strong>
    template from the
    <i>
        Templates
    </i>
    subtab on the
    <i>
        Race
    </i>
    tab.
    Without that template, the
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    is not going to
    work correctly.
</p>
<h2>
    The Paragon Mecha
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    The
    <i>
        Paragon
    </i>
    <strong>
        Mecha
    </strong>
    should
    be getting the
    <i>
        Missile pack for M-87 Talon Missile Launcher
        (4)
    </i>
    and the
    <i>
        Rocket pack for M-70 EMP Rocket Launcher (6)
    </i>
    twice, but the
    <i>
        AUTO:EQUIP
    </i>
    tag doesn't work well with
    equipping the same item twice. You need to add the second pieces of
    these equipment packs manually.

<h1>
    Future - Robots
</h1>
<h2>
    Building Robots
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    There are two sets of Robot races, one is meant
    for heroic characters run by Players, the other is meant for
    non-heroic characters. The races 4 named
    <strong>
        Biodroid
        (Medium
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Small)
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Bioreplica
        (Medium
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
        Small)
    </strong>
    are Player races and
    gain feats and skills when PC classes are gained as normal. The
    races whose names are formatted
    <strong>
        Robot(Type/Size)
    </strong>
    are all non-heroic, they do not gain feats or skill points as long
    as they are advanced in the
    <strong>
        Robot
    </strong>
    monster class,
    if given levels of an
    <i>
        Ordinary
    </i>
    base class they will not gain
    feats (unless equipped with a
    <i>
        Feat Web
    </i>
    ) but they will gain
    skill points, these should be discarded unless the Robot is
    equipped with a
    <i>
        Skill Web
    </i>
    .
</p>
<h2>
    Purchase DCs
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    The purchase DC for a Robot is calculated and
    displayed in the special ability window. The purchase DC for some
    robotic equipment and accessories is not shown in the cost field
    but is instead displayed in the equipment's special property
    display. This is because the cost of many of these items are
    dependent on the cost of the Robot frame they are installed on,
    thus the purchase DC can be calculated but only after the item is
    equipped to the robot character. Items with straight purchase DCs
    are displayed in the cost field normally.
</p>
<h2>
    Equipment
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    All the Robot equipment is meant only for
    Robots, the bonuses they have which provide the functionality are
    qualified as such and will not benefit characters who are not
    Robots.
</p>
<h2>
    Locomotion
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    All Robots need to have some form of locomotion
    equipped to them to provide a movement speed. The speed can be
    increased by customizing the locomotion equipment and adding a
    speed upgrade. The rules say you cannot upgrade the speed past
    double its base speed but
    <strong>
        PCGen
    </strong>
    cannot enforce
    this.
</p>
<h2>
    Manipulators
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    The Manipulators are size tiny and are meant for
    Medium-sized Robots. To get the proper damage for a Robot of
    another size you will need to customize the Manipulators for that
    Robot, they should be 2 size categories smaller than the Robot they
    will be installed on.
</p>
<h2>
    Skill Software
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    The Skill software equipment all needs to be
    customized before you can add it to your character. This is so you
    can select the specific skills the equipment emulates.
</p>
<h2>
    Feat Software
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    The Feat software could not be implemented the
    same way that skill software was. Each feat has a corresponding
    Robot Feat Software item which adds it as a virtual feat when the
    item is equipped. There are two sets of items relating to feat
    software, the actual devices, feat progit, feat net, and feat web
    and then there the individual feat software which grants the
    virtual feat. The software has no purchase DC but is assumed to
    come with the device when purchased. The Weapon Finesse and Weapon
    Focus feats are missing, as they couldn't be implemented that
    way.
