               PCGen's 4E Data Set Creation: Introduction

               When these documents are completed and merged with the rest of the PCGen Docs, the links for
                       pcgen.css and valid-html1401.png must be updated.

<h1>
    4th Edition and PCGen
</h1>
<p class="indent0">
    Unfortunately 4th Edition is closed content and
    we do not have permission to create and distribute data for this
    game. PCGen can support 4th Edition as easily as it supports 3.5
    and 3.0 and many of our users have in fact created their own
    datasets for 4th Edition.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    Because of the interest in using PCGen for 4th
    Edition we have done what we can by creating a Starter Set as an
    aid to those wishing to code up their own data. The Starter Set is
    available as a separate download in the form of a data installer
    zip. It is kept separate because it is incomplete, it's basically
    an almost empty structure which you can use to start coding your
    own set.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The Starter Set includes a dataset which has
    some sample data but no actual content from the game itself. The
    sample data is meant to show how the data can be coded and you may
    want to delete or comment it out as you create your own. The
    Starter Set also includes gameMode files specifically set up for
    4e, output sheets and preview sheets and additional documentation
    with instructions for creating datasets for 4e. The output sheets
    and preview sheets are only slightly modified versions of 3.5
    sheets and still need a lot of work to be fully 4e, again this is
    meant to be a starting point.
</p>
<p class="indent0">
    The starter set itself is incomplete and its
    future usefulness depends largely on the feedback and contributions
    of you, our community. If you have suggestions, improvements to the
    instructions or gameMode files, better outputsheets, etc.. please
    post them to our yahoo group and we will happily update the starter
    set package.
</p>

<p class="indent0">
    You can download the 4e Starter Set installer

        from our download page

    Good luck and happy coding!
