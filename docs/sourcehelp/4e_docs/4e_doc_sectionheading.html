                PCGen's 4E Data Set Creation: Introduction

                When these documents are completed and merged with the rest of the PCGen Docs, the links for 
                        pcgen.css and valid-html1401.png must be updated.

  <h1>
   4th Edition and PCGen
  </h1>
  <p class="indent0">
   Unfortunately 4th Edition is closed content and
we do not have permission to create and distribute data for this
game. PCGen can support 4th Edition as easily as it supports 3.5
and 3.0 and many of our users have in fact created their own
datasets for 4th Edition.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   Because of the interest in using PCGen for 4th
Edition we have done what we can by creating a Starter Set as an
aid to those wishing to code up their own data. The Starter Set is
available as a separate download in the form of a data installer
zip. It is kept separate because it is incomplete, it's basically
an almost empty structure which you can use to start coding your
own set.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   The Starter Set includes a dataset which has
some sample data but no actual content from the game itself. The
sample data is meant to show how the data can be coded and you may
want to delete or comment it out as you create your own. The
Starter Set also includes gameMode files specifically set up for
4e, output sheets and preview sheets and additional documentation
with instructions for creating datasets for 4e. The output sheets
and preview sheets are only slightly modified versions of 3.5
sheets and still need a lot of work to be fully 4e, again this is
meant to be a starting point.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   The starter set itself is incomplete and its
future usefulness depends largely on the feedback and contributions
of you, our community. If you have suggestions, improvements to the
instructions or gameMode files, better outputsheets, etc.. please
post them to our yahoo group and we will happily update the starter
set package.
  </p>
