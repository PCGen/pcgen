    This read me file contains information on how to
    make the most of this dataset. Specifically it will alert you to
    work-around's for Spycraft rules that PCGen does not currently
    support.
</p>
<h3>
    Chambers
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    The Chambers are represented in PCGen by a
    series of templates which can be found in the bottom pane of the
    department tab. They are mutually exclusive as your PC may only
    belong to only one at a time. You will need to choose one manually
    and they are removable. Any option which has membership in a
    certain Chamber as a requirement will use these templates to test
    for qualification. Your PC's chosen Chamber will appear on the
    output sheet in the list of Templates.
</p>
<h3>
    Class Abilities
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    The Psion classes have an ability called Psi
    Mastery, which allows the psion to choose a psion skill that he has
    at least 1 rank in and gain a bonus in. At this time PCGen will
    produce a list of all skills the character has ranks in and cannot
    at this time limit the list to just those psionic skills the
    character has ranks in, its up to you to select the appropriate
    skill.
</p>
<h3>
    Feats
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Several of the basic psion feats provide
    enhancements to a chosen psionic skill the character has ranks in.
    For that reason you should spend you skill points before taking any
    of these feats. Also note that PCGen will produce a list of all
    skills the character has ranks in and cannot at this time limit the
    list to just those psionic skills the character has ranks in, its
    up to you to select the appropriate skill.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The feat
    <strong>
        Heightened Inner
        Strength
    </strong>
    is a complicated one that cannot be fully
    supported. The main problem is that the feat applies bonuses to the
    PC every five levels after the level the PC has chosen the feat and
    there is not mechanism in PCGen to test for which level the feat
    was added. As a work around there is a second feat in the list
    named
    <strong>
        Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses
    </strong>
    which will
    allow you to apply the bonuses manually. The first time you add the
    Heightened Inner Strength feat you will be given the choice of
    which ability to enhance and one feat slot will be used. At the
    appropriate level you can add the next ability enhancement by
    choosing
    <strong>
        Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses
    </strong>
    which
    will offer the same choices but will not cost you a feat slot. This
    method used six hidden feats each of which can add up to 2 points
    to an ability and in that regard the rules are enforced. Because of
    the way this is set up it has the potential to incorrectly add
    points to your feat pool. If you choose the
    <strong>
        Heightened
        Inner Strength Bonuses
    </strong>
    feat and do not choose an ability
    bonus, one point will be incorrectly added to you feat pool. You
    can also use the
    <strong>
        Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses
    </strong>
    feat to remove bonuses but bear in mind that this too will
    incorrectly add points to your feat pool.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    The feat
    <strong>
        Evolved Mind
    </strong>
    feat will
    add skill points to your highest Mentalist class level, so if you
    have multi-classed the points will not appear in your current class
    skill point pool if that class is not Mentalist. Use the 'Skill
    point left for class' pop up menu to find your highest Mentalist
    level and spend those points there. Since this feat makes all skill
    class skills for the Mentalist it does not matter where there are
    spent.
