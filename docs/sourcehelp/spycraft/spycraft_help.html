<p class="indent1">
    This read me file contains information on how to
    make the most of this dataset. Specifically it will alert you to
    work-around's for Spycraft rules that PCGen does not currently
    support.
</p>
<h3>
    Nationalities
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    When you select your department the first pop up
    chooser will let you select your characters nationality. This will
    apply a template which specifies your nationality and will grant
    you an additional bonus language if your native countries language
    is something other than English. The Nationality template can be
    removed and replaced with another as people in the modern age will
    occasionally immigrate though the bonus language granted with your
    original choice will not be removed. You can only apply one
    Nationality at a time. The list is by no means complete, if you
    wish to add additional nationalities edit the
    spycraft_templates.lst file to add the nationality template. Edit
    the spycraft_feats_hidden.lst file to add additional choices to the
    list that appears when you choose a department. The Language list
    is also incomplete, you can add them by editing the
    spycraft_languages.lst file.
</p>
<h3>
    Skills
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    The skills 'Hobby (Untrained)' and 'Sport
    (Untrained)' are listed to keep the skill list uncluttered and
    cannot be selected. Although all sport and hobby skills are usable
    untrained only these two will show up when skills are exported with
    'show untrained skills' selected.
</p>
<h3>
    Backgrounds
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Backgrounds appear in the skill list though they
    are not skills and are never used as such. They are in the skill
    list because they are purchased with skill points. The rules say
    you can have no more than 5 points in no more than 2 backgrounds at
    any one time. PCGen does not enforce this rule. Once the background
    is resolved or 'cashed in' it is suggested that you transfer the
    skill points into the skill named 'Resolved Backgrounds'.
</p>
<h3>
    Languages
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Languages are treated a little differently in
    Spycraft and some work around's are used to comply with the
    Spycraft rules. It is suggested that you create a new note in the
    description tab to keep a list of which languages your character
    speaks natively and another for those picked up by making a
    language check. Languages your character starts with are considered
    native. Any languages learned through the language skill can become
    native by spending an additional skill rank on it. To do this
    purchase one rank of the Native Language Skill corresponding to
    that language. The Native Language Skill will add one rank to the
    Languages Skill but no additional languages. The Native Language
    Skills is a work-around, you should always use your Languages score
    for skill checks. Adding more then one rank of any Native Language
    Skill will not add any additional ranks to Languages, so don't do
    it.
</p>
<h3>
    Feats
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Training
    </strong>
    grants you 4
    additional skill points, however PCGen cannot add these. You may
    add these points manually by changing the number in the "Skill
    Points left for Class" field on the Skills Tab.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Unlocked Potential
    </strong>
    raises your
    max ranks for a specific skill. PCGen does not have a way to raise
    the max ranks for a specific skill, the feat will allow you to
    choose the skill to apply it to but it will not raise the maximum
    ranks you can spend on it. To work around this limitation you can
    check the Bypass Max Skill Ranks option in
    <a href="../../menupages/settings/character/characterhouserulesoption.html">
        Preferences/House Rules
    </a>
    .
</p>
<h3>
    Purchasing Equipment
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    PCGen cannot yet deal with multiple currency
    systems like that used in Spycraft. Items in Spycraft have a budget
    point value or a gadget point value as well as a monetary value if
    purchased on the street. This dataset lists items in either budget
    points or gadgets points. The first Type listed for every item is
    either Gear, Gadget or Vehicle. Gear type items are bought with
    Budget Points and Mission Budget points while Gadget and Vehicle
    type items are bought with Gadget Points. PCGen cannot tell the
    difference between the two and does not restrict your purchasing,
    it is up to the user to determine his or her budgets and stay
    within them. This is especially important if you customize a gear
    item with a gadget modification, the customizer will add the
    modification cost (in gadget points) to the cost of the gear item
    (in budget points) and the resulting cost will be incorrect. You
    can see your characters budgets in the lower right pane in the
    Class Tab. Street values are not listed.
</p>
<h3>
    Modifying Equipment
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Some gadgets and vehicles can be modified with
    additional capabilities. To do this right click on the item to
    bring up the customizer. The modifications will be listed and can
    be added to the item for an additional cost. Please note that
    Spycraft places some limits on the number of modifications that can
    be added to certain items. PCGen does not restrict the number of
    modifications you can add though the Spycraft rules do. Please read
    the rules to determine the limits.
</p>
<h3>
    Equipment
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    To get the full benefits of
    <strong>
        Tiger
        claws
    </strong>
    you must equip your PC with a pair, one on each
    hand. Using one will only give you half of the bonuses.
</p>
<h3>
    Vehicles
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    PCGen will output the correct stats for your
    chosen vehicle but you must set things up in a certain way for it
    to output correctly. Most importantly you must Equip the vehicle to
    the character in the equipping sub-tab, setting the vehicle to not
    carried or another setting will not activate the vehicle stats.
    Secondly you may only equip one vehicle at any one time, the reason
    for this is that PCGen cannot, at this time, assign variables to
    objects and so all variables are associated with your character.
    What this means is that if you equip you character with 2 or more
    vehicles that output sheet will still only have one vehicle block
    but the stats will equal the combined totals of all the vehicles
    you have. Equipping the vehicle to your character does not add any
    weight or take up any slots from your character not does any items
    you may put in the vehicle. Vehicles are containers that do not
    have any restrictions on what they may contain, I leave that to
    you, your Game master and common sense.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Customizing vehicles. You may add gadgets and
    other refinements to your vehicle by customizing it. Find the
    vehicle in the equipment list and right click it to choose create
    custom object. You will be presented with a list of refinements you
    can add to the vehicle. PCGen will not limit the number of these
    items you can add to the vehicle, again its up to you and your GM
    to follow the rules. When output the OS will display the number of
    gadgets as well as the maximum number of gadgets that can be added
    to that type of vehicle.
</p>
<h3>
    Using the Output Sheet
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    At this time there is an html sheet and a pdf
    template. The text set in the tab name field of the summery tab
    will output as the characters code name. You can find the Spycraft
    html Output Sheet in the Modern/HTML folder, it is named
    csheet_spycraft_std.htm. The Spycraft pdf Output Sheet can be found
    in the Modern/PDF folder, it is named csheet_spycraft_std.fo.
