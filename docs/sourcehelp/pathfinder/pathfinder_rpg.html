<h3>
    Specialized Wizard
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    A wizard can choose to specialize in one school
    of magic but must select two other schools as his opposition
    schools. There are a couple of aspects of wizard specialization
    that PCGen does not handle at this time:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <br/>
    <em>
        A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level
        wizard spells (except those from his opposition schools, if
        any)
    </em>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Currently PCGen will add all 0-level spells to a
    wizard's known spells, you must manually remove the opposition
    school spells to comply with this rule.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
    <br/>
    <em>
        A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must
        use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell.
    </em>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    Currently PCGen cannot enforce this, you could
    add the spell twice to your prepared spells list to represent the
    two slots.
</p>
<h3>
    Ability descriptions
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    Paizo has allowed the use of the full text in
    the descriptions of abilities. For some abilities this text can be
    quite long. In order to provide an option for those who don't want
    to have the full text filling up their character sheet we are
    utilizing a feature that has not been use previously in the Open
    Source datasets. The dataset can hold two versions of the
    description, a short description, which is usually the flavor text
    and an optional long description or benefit text which can contain
    the full text of the ability description. To set this option choose
    "
    <a href="../../menupages/settings/settingspreferencesoption.html">
        Preferences
    </a>
    "
    from the Settings menu. Click on
    <a href="../../menupages/settings/appearance/appearancedisplay.html">
        Display
        Options in the Appearance tree
    </a>
    and find the "
    <a href="../../menupages/settings/appearance/appearancedisplay.html">
        Display
        Feat Description
    </a>
    " option. When this is checked the short
    description is output, when it is unchecked the longer benefit text
    is displayed if there is such text available. If there is no
    benefit text the short description will be used by default.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    For those who wish to have a technical
    explanation of how this is done refer to the
    <a href="../../listfilepages/datafilestagpages/datafilesability.html#benefit">
        BENEFIT
    </a>
    tag. This tag allows the data to contain two versions
    of ability descriptions, the
    <a href="../../listfilepages/globalfilestagpages/globalfilesother.html#desc">
        DESC
    </a>
    generally holds a short version and
    <a href="../../listfilepages/datafilestagpages/datafilesability.html#benefit">
        BENEFIT
    </a>
    holds the longer version.
