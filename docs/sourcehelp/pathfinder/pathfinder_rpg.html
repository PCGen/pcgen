	<h3>Ability descriptions</h3>	
	
	<p class="indent1">Paizo has allow the use of the full text in the descriptions of abilities. For some abilities this text can be quite long. In order to provide an option for those who don't want to have the full text filling up their character sheet we are utilizing a feature that has not be use previously in the Open Source datasets. The dataset can hold two versions of the description, a short description, which is usually the flavor text and an optional long description or benefit text which can contain the full text of the ability description. To set this option choose &quot;<a href="../../menupages/settings/settingspreferencesoption.html">Preferences</a>&quot; from the Settings menu. Click on <a href="../../menupages/settings/appearance/appearancedisplay.html">Display Options in the Appearance tree</a> and find the &quot;<a href="../../menupages/settings/appearance/appearancedisplay.html">Display Feat Description</a>&quot; option. When this is checked the short description is output, when it is unchecked the longer benefit text is displayed if there is such text available. If there is no benefit text the short description will be used by default.</p>
	<p class="indent1">For those who wish to have a technical explanation of how this is done refer to the <a href="../../listfilepages/datafilestagpages/datafilesability.html#BENEFIT">BENEFIT</a> tag. This tag allows the data to contain two versions of ability descriptions, the <a href="../../listfilepages/globalfilestagpages/globalfilesother.html#DESC">DESC</a> generally holds a short version and <a href="../../listfilepages/datafilestagpages/datafilesability.html#BENEFIT">BENEFIT</a> holds the longer version.</p>
