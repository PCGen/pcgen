    Equipment Descriptions
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Quiver:
    </strong>
    A light leather
    container with a strap made for carrying arrows or bolts. Groups of
    20 bolts or arrows usually come in a quiver.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Sheath:
    </strong>
    A simple leather
    container with a strap made for carrying a single weapon; it can
    either be worn on a belt for one-handed type weapons or across the
    back for larger two-handed weapons.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Armor Padding:
    </strong>
    This item comes
    with the purchase of Full Plate armor.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Cap (Steel):
    </strong>
    This item comes
    with the purchase of a Chain Shirt.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Helmet (Visored):
    </strong>
    This item
    comes with the purchase of Full Plate armor.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Bracers of Armor +9 and +10:
    </strong>
    These items function exactly like other Bracers of Armor just at a
    +9 and +10 bonus. They are included here because the
    MagicItemsV.rtf document details Bracers from +1 to +8 and the Epic
    document details Bracers from +11 and higher. These two fill in the
    gap.
</p>
<h3>
    Starting Funds Kits
</h3>
<p class="indent1">
    These kits will randomly grant an amount of
    gold, adding it to the "Gold" field on the
    <strong>
        Gear
        Tab
    </strong>
    which can then be spent purchasing equipment. There
    are several kits corresponding to the typical dice used for this
    purpose. The
    <strong>
        Starting Gold
    </strong>
    kits can be applied as
    many times as you wish and they will continue to add more gold to
    your PC.

    <a id="pcgenogcpsicrystal" name="pcgenogcpsicrystal">
        PCGen OGC
        - Psicrystal Hit Dice Data Set
    </a>
</h2>
<p class="indent1">
    <strong>
        Game Mode: 35e
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The PCGen Open Gaming Content - Psicrystal Hit Dice dataset is
    designed to modify Psicrystals in the RSRD Psionics dataset so that
    they gain hit dice as the Master progresses in class levels.
</p>
<p>
    The need for this originates from certain interpretations of the
    Psicrystal rules which hold that Psicrystals gain hit dice as the
    Master progresses in class levels and by extension also gain feats
    every 3 levels and stat bumps every 4. The dataset was not coded in
    this way and the designers apparently never intended this, however
    no errata has been published to refute or clarify this
    interpretation. This set is provided for those who wish to play
    Psicrystals under this interpretation.
</p>
<p>
    This set must be loaded with the RSRD Psionics set or the RSRD
    Complete set (which includes Psionics). When loaded it adds Hit
    Dice (Monster Class Levels) equal to the masters Psionic class
    levels. It also adds a point to the feat pool at first, third and
    every three levels after. Every four levels it grants a 1 point
    increase to an attribute of the user's choice.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note:
    </strong>
    An unmodified Psicrystal is granted
    Alertness as a virtual feat, this set disables that, Alertness must
    be purchased with a feat point if it is desired.
</p>
<h3>
    Additional Feature
</h3>
<p>
    The rules state that a Psicrystal has at least 4 Ranks in Spot,
    Listen, Move Silently, and Search even if its Master does not.
    PCGen cannot implement this automatically so 4 temporary bonuses
    can be activated manually by the user to bring the ranks of these
    skills up to 4 if the Master is lacking. They can be found in the
    Temporary Bonuses sub-tab of the Inventory Tab under templates.
    Each starts with the name "Psicrystal Skills" and allows you to set
    the Rank from 1 to 4.
