   Equipment Descriptions

  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Quiver:
   </strong>
   A light leather
container with a strap made for carrying arrows or bolts. Groups of
20 bolts or arrows usually come in a quiver.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Sheath:
   </strong>
   A simple leather
container with a strap made for carrying a single weapon; it can
either be worn on a belt for one-handed type weapons or across the
back for larger two-handed weapons.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Armor Padding:
   </strong>
   This item comes
with the purchase of Full Plate armor.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Cap (Steel):
   </strong>
   This item comes
with the purchase of a Chain Shirt.

   </strong>
   This item
comes with the purchase of Full Plate armor.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Bracers of Armor +9 and +10:
   </strong>
   These items function exactly like other Bracers of Armor just at a
+9 and +10 bonus. They are included here because the
MagicItemsV.rtf document details Bracers from +1 to +8 and the Epic
document details Bracers from +11 and higher. These two fill in the
gap.

  <h3>
   Starting Funds Kits

  <p class="indent1">
   These kits will randomly grant an amount of
gold, adding it to the "Gold" field on the
   <strong>
    Gear

   which can then be spent purchasing equipment. There
are several kits corresponding to the typical dice used for this
purpose. The
   <strong>
    Starting Gold

   kits can be applied as
many times as you wish and they will continue to add more gold to
your PC.

    PCGen OGC
- Psicrystal Hit Dice Data Set
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Game Mode: 35e
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The PCGen Open Gaming Content - Psicrystal Hit Dice dataset is
designed to modify Psicrystals in the RSRD Psionics dataset so that
they gain hit dice as the Master progresses in class levels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The need for this originates from certain interpretations of the
Psicrystal rules which hold that Psicrystals gain hit dice as the
Master progresses in class levels and by extension also gain feats
every 3 levels and stat bumps every 4. The dataset was not coded in
this way and the designers apparently never intended this, however
no errata has been published to refute or clarify this
interpretation. This set is provided for those who wish to play
Psicrystals under this interpretation.
  </p>
  <p>
   This set must be loaded with the RSRD Psionics set or the RSRD
Complete set (which includes Psionics). When loaded it adds Hit
Dice (Monster Class Levels) equal to the masters Psionic class
levels. It also adds a point to the feat pool at first, third and
every three levels after. Every four levels it grants a 1 point
increase to an attribute of the user's choice.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   An unmodified Psicrystal is granted
Alertness as a virtual feat, this set disables that, Alertness must
be purchased with a feat point if it is desired.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Additional Feature
  </h3>
  <p>
   The rules state that a Psicrystal has at least 4 Ranks in Spot,
Listen, Move Silently, and Search even if its Master does not.
PCGen cannot implement this automatically so 4 temporary bonuses
can be activated manually by the user to bring the ranks of these
skills up to 4 if the Master is lacking. They can be found in the
Temporary Bonuses sub-tab of the Inventory Tab under templates.
Each starts with the name "Psicrystal Skills" and allows you to set
the Rank from 1 to 4.
