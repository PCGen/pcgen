<h1>
    Skills Tab
</h1>
<p>
    This is the
    <strong>
        Skill
    </strong>
    tab where the user selects
    what skills from the list of skills loaded from the sources that
    were chosen when first starting PCGen.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Main Tab: Skills" src="../images/tabs/skillstab/tab_skills_00.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The table in the top left displays the name of the Skill, the
    total skill bonus, the skill modifier, the ranks taken by the
    character, and whether the skill is a class skill or not.
</p>
<p>
    The table at the top right displays all the skills along with
    useful bits of information about them such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Skill
        </strong>
    </li>

        </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A
    <strong>
        Cost
    </strong>
    of 0 means that you cannot purchase this
    skill unless in the
    <strong>
        Options
    </strong>
    tab a non-zero cost to
    these exclusive skills (usually the value is 4 or higher) were
    assigned.
</p>
<p>
    Once the skill has been selected, right click on the Skill and
    select any of the following:
