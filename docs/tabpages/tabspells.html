<h1>
    Spells Tab
</h1>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Spells
    </strong>
    tab is where a spellcasting
    character can select spells.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Sub-Tab: Known Spells" src="../images/tabs/spellstab/tab_spells_00_known.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The Spells Tab is divided into three sub-tabs: Known Spells,
    Prepared Spells and Spell Books.
</p>
<p>
    The Known Spells sub-tab is used to add spells to the PC's Known
    Spells lists.
</p>
<p>
    The upper left frame is where you can select which
    <strong>
        Class
    </strong>
    , and
    <strong>
        Level
    </strong>
    you wish to be
    displayed in the spells tables below.
</p>
<p>
    Each spell casting class will display a list on the left of all
    available spells the PC could potentially learn. All spell casters
    have a
    <strong>
        Known Spells
    </strong>
    list - in this list are all
    the spells the caster knows. Spells can be added from the complete
    spell list on the right in accordance to class limitations.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Wizards can put an unlimited number of spells in their Known
        Spell lists
    </li>
    <li>
        Sorcerers and the like can only add a finite amount
    </li>
    <li>
        Some classes (mostly Divine) know all spells automatically so
        the Class list will match the Known Spells list from the start
        without the need to add any.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A spell caster who must prepare spell ahead of time can use the
    Prepared Spells sub-tab to create Prepared Spell lists.
</p>
<p>
    A spell caster who must record spells in a spellbook can use the
    Spell Books sub-tab to track which spells are kept in which
    books.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Sub-Tab: Prepared Spells" src="../images/tabs/spellstab/tab_spells_00_prepared.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The Prepared Spells sub-tab is used to create lists of spells
    from the PC's Known Spells lists which represent spells the caster
    has at the ready.
</p>
<p>
    Spell casters, which can memorize spells, can type in a name in
    the
    <strong>
        Spell List
    </strong>
    field and then:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use the
        <strong>
            Add
        </strong>
        button to add a new list to the
        right hand top pane
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the
        <strong>
            Del
        </strong>
        button to remove that list from
        the right hand top pane
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Only spell casters that memorize spells can create prepared
    spell lists.
</p>
<p>
    Typical uses of this are for creating a book named "Underground"
    to hold which spells used when in a dungeon-crawl, or a book named
    "In Town" to indicate which spells used when in a town
    adventure.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Sub-Tab: Spellbooks" src="../images/tabs/spellstab/tab_spells_00_spellbook.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The Spell Books sub-tab is used to track physical spellbooks the
    spell caster possesses.
</p>
<p>
    If your class uses a Spellbook to record spells in you can use
    the Spell Books sub-tab to track your spellbooks. First you will
    need to add one of these items to your inventory. The Spellbook
    (Wizard's/Blank) and the Blessed Book items are specifically set up
    for this purpose, when either item is added to your PC's list of
    equipment they will also appear on the Spell Books sub-tab. It is
    suggested that you customize the Spellbook (Wizard's/Blank) item to
    give it a unique name (such as "Merlin's Spellbook Vol 1") making
    it easier to keep track of. Once you have a spellbook in your
    inventory you can add your known spells to it, each spell will take
    the proper number of pages according to the rules making it easy to
    know when it's time to buy another spellbook.
