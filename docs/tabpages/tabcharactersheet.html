		<h1>Character Sheet Tab</h1>
		
		<p>The Character Sheet Tab is a new feature making it's debut in version 5.13.2. 
		  The Character Sheet Tab is similar to the Preview tab and it's purpose is the 
		  same: to display your characters information. The difference between the Preview 
		  Tab and the Character Sheet Tab is that the Preview Tabs layout is coded in 
		  java and can't be adjusted except by editing the code and recompiling the 
		  program. The Character Sheet Tab uses html to render its display, this means 
		  that the sheets can be edited with a text editor while the program is running 
		  and they can be created and altered by anyone with a little knowledge of html 
		  and OS tokens. The html output sheets used for output can be used in the Character 
		  Sheet Tab, in fact most of the sheets available are simply duplicates of the 
		  output sheets. </p>

		<p>Changes made to the character in PCGen are updated automatically in the Character 
		  Sheet Tab at the time you make them. So, for example, if you were to apply the 
		  Rage bonuses from the Temporary Bonus Tab you would see these changes applied 
		  to your character when you returned to the Character Sheet Tab.</p>

		<p>The Character Sheet Tab has an additional pane on the right which can be accessed 
		  by clicking the arrow along the vertical border of the window. This pane displays 
		  the Character Sheet selection menu, the Equipsets and a list of temporary bonuses 
		  which have been applied to the PC. The Character Sheet selection menu enables 
		  you to select a sheet from a list of sheets available for the currently active 
		  gameMode. The radio button beside each Equipset indicates which Equipset is 
		  currently being applied to the PC and displayed in the Character Sheet Tab. 
		  You can switch to another Equipset by simply clicking on the corresponding radio 
		  button. Each temporary bonus has a check box on it's left which indicate if 
		  it is active or not. Temporary bonuses can be switched off and on with the check 
		  box which will update the output of the Character Sheet tab.</p>

		<h2>Configuration</h2>
		
		<p>All the sheets used by the Character Sheet Tab can be found in the pcgen/preview 
		  directory. Each gameMode has a specific directory of sheets which is set in 
		  the gameModes miscinfo.lst file with the 
		  <a href="../../listfilepages/systemfilestagpages/gamemodemiscinfolist.html#PREVIEWDIR">PREVIEWDIR</a> 
		  tag. Each gameMode also has a default sheet set by the 
		  <a href="../../listfilepages/systemfilestagpages/gamemodemiscinfolist.html#PREVIEWSHEET">PREVIEWSHEET</a> 
		  miscinfo.lst file.</p>
  
		<p>Character Sheets can contain images, the paths to the images must use the 
		  pcgen directory as its root.</p>
		
		<p>Character Sheets can utilize Javascript. Check out the preview.html sheet for 
		  examples of what can be accomplished by javascript savvy coders.</p>
