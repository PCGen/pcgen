<h1>
    Classes Tab
</h1>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Class
    </strong>
    tab is where you add class levels to
    your characters.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Main Tab: Classes" src="../images/tabs/classestab/tab_classes_00.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The left pane displays the full list of classes available from
    the loaded data sets. Besides PC classes, this list also includes
    all NPC and Creature classes. Clicking on the
    <strong>
        Qualified
    </strong>
    button will remove all classes that have
    requirements that the current character does not meet. An example
    of this would be a class with an alignment requirement, such as the
    <strong>
        Paladin
    </strong>
    which requires that the character be
    "Lawful Good". Finally, you can use the
    <strong>
        Search
    </strong>
    field to find the class you are looking for.
</p>
<p>
    The right pane is where the character's classes appear as they
    are added. All classes previously selected, from this tab or from
    the
    <strong>
        Summary
    </strong>
    tab, will already be listed here. In
    this case, if you continue and select another class, either the
    same of a new class, the newly selected class will be added to the
    list.
</p>
<p>
    The lower pane is the
    <strong>
        Class Info
    </strong>
    pane. When you
    select a class in the left or right pane this pane will display the
    basic information for the selected class.
</p>
<p>
    Selecting a class is a simple process. Find and click on the
    desired class in the left pane and then click on the
    <strong>
        Add
        Level(s) &gt;
    </strong>
    button. The class appears in the right pane,
    at the bottom of the list, and you are done.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to remove a class level you click on the
    <strong>
        &lt; Remove Level
    </strong>
    button. The last class added
    will be removed from the character and from the right pane.
