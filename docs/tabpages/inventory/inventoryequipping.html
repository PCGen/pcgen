</p>
<p>
    This Sub-tab allows the Gear that was purchased to be equipped.
    It also allows the creation of multiple equipment sets so you can
    print output sheets based on different weapon, armor and item
    combinations for your character.
</p>
<p>
    Select locations for the items your character owns on the upper
    right frame.
</p>
<p>
    Armors, shields, and magical items need to be marked as
    "Equipped" so that PCGen gives you the appropriate benefit for
    using them.
</p>
<p>
    Weapons can be equipped as Single Handed, Two Handed and Both
    Hands. The equipped style determines what bonuses/penalties apply.
    Weapons that are carried will appear on the character sheet in the
    weapons section.
</p>
<p>
    Some items are containers and can hold other items.
</p>
<p>
    Every item your character is carrying should be marked "Carried"
    so your encumbrance will be figured correctly.
</p>
<p>
    You can add additional equipment sets by typing in the name of
    an equipment set and clicking on the Add button (in the Upper right
    hand frame).
</p>
<p>
    You can then select equipment from the left hand frame (this
    contains what you bought in the gear tab) into the equipment sets
    you chose (e.g. Dungeon, City etc). You can do this by selecting an
    item and double clicking on it or clicking on the
    <strong>
        Add
    </strong>
    ("&gt;") button.
