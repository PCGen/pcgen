		<p>The <strong>Abilities</strong> window is where you can assign 
		Languages, see your special abilities (granted by race &amp; class), add &amp; remove 
		special abilities, see your existing weapon proficiencies, and add more weapon 
		proficiencies.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Languages</strong> section consists of the display window, 
		where your languages known will be displayed, the <strong>Skill</strong> &amp; <strong>Other</strong> 
		buttons which will bring up a selection window to choose languages from.&nbsp; 
		The <strong>Skill</strong> button allows you to choose languages based on skill points 
		spent and the <strong>Other</strong> button allows you to select languages based upon your 
		character stats.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Special Abilities</strong> consists of the display window, 
		where all Special Abilities gained from races and/or classes is displayed and the
		<strong>Add</strong> &amp; <strong>Remove</strong> buttons. The <strong>Add</strong> 
		will bring up a window that allows you to type in your own Special Abilities 
		or select from a list of Special Abilities pulled from the loaded sources. 
		The <strong>Remove</strong> button is used to remove Special Abilities added with 
		the <strong>Add</strong> button. You can only remove Special Abilities you enter yourself, 
		Special Abilities granted by races, classes or other sources cannot be removed.</p>

		is populated by your racial and class weapon proficiency lists, and the <strong>
		Optional Profs</strong> button that will bring up a new window for you to choose any 
		weapon proficiencies granted by a race, feat, or class.</p>
