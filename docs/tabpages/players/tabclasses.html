Next to the word &quot;Available&quot; is a selection box that lets		the user pick which &quot;view&quot; to use. It is this view, which will be		used to determine the structure of the table below it. The same is true for the		&quot;Selected&quot; classes, which list the classes and levels of the		character. </p>				<p><strong>Add a level</strong> of a class		by double-clicking on it, right clicking on it or clicking on it and the on the		right-arrow button. Similarly to <strong>remove levels</strong> of a class by		double-clicking on it in the &quot;Selected&quot; table, or by right-clicking		on it there, or by selecting it and then clicking on the left-arrow button		above the table. As elsewhere in PCGen anything not qualified for is in red		italics. The Pre-Reqs columns list the pre-requisites of the classes.</p>				<p>The info-pane in the bottom-left will give you details about any class you		click on - including its HD, BAB progression, save progressions and more.</p>				<p>The bottom-right section gives all the class-related information about the		character. Click on the <strong>HP button</strong> to adjust them there. </p>				<p>The current number of optional <strong>feats</strong> to spend, the remaining <strong>skill		points</strong>, base <strong>reflex, fortitude and will</strong> checks be also displayed. </p>				<p>The <strong>Experience</strong> field is 		editable and indicates how many experience points your character has. </p>				<p> The <strong>Adj XP</strong> button will bring up a small window 		where you can enter in the amount of XP you wish to add to your character.</p>				<p>There are &quot;sliding dividers&quot; between the class tables - click on		this divider and slide it back and forth to the preferred location. There's		also a divider between the upper-tables and the info sections below to drag up		and down to change the viewing area of each. There's another divider between		the info sections. This combination of 3 sliding dividers is common to most of		the character-related tabs change how much screen real estate is devoted to		each section. On most tabs there's a button, which has 2 circling arrows that		will reverse the orientation of the views between horizontal and vertical. This		gives many options on the layout of the tab.</p>				<!-- <p class="cvsfooter">$Source: /cvsroot/pcgendocs/pcgendocs/docs/tabpages/players/tabclasses.html,v $ ($Revision: 1.4 $) last updated $Date: 2004/04/30 23:43:56 $ by $Author: eddyanthony $</p> -->	</body></html>
