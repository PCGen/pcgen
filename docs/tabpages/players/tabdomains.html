Click on 		one that the PC is qualified for (the name isn't in red italics) and then click 		on the &quot;Select&quot; button to select it. Once a deity is chosen the Domain table in 		the upper-right will be populated with the appropriate domains. The number of 		domains the user can choose and the number of domains they have chosen will be 		indicated.</p>				<p>When clicking on a deity the details about it will be displayed in the 		lower-left window. Likewise, clicking on a domain will cause its details to be 		displayed in the lower-right window.</p>				<p>Right clicking on any deity name will supply you with an 		option to create your own deity. Alternately you can go to the Menu, 		Tools, List Editors, Deity Editor to create a new deity from scratch.</p>	  <!-- <p class="cvsfooter">$Source: /cvsroot/pcgendocs/pcgendocs/docs/tabpages/players/tabdomains.html,v $ ($Revision: 1.2 $) last updated $Date: 2004/04/04 20:24:21 $ by $Author: eddyanthony $</p> -->	</body></html>
