   Preview Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   The Preview Tab displays all characters loaded in PCGen in a
format similar to the output sheets PCGen exports to. Changes made
to the character in PCGen are updated automatically in the Preview
Tab at the time you make them. So, for example, if you were to
apply the Rage bonuses from the Temporary Bonus Tab you would see
these changes applied to your character when you returned to the
Preview Tab.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tabs on the left allow you to navigate through the pages of
the character sheet. Page contains the primary information such as
name, ability scores, skills, hit points, etc.. Page 2 contains
additional information such as Feats and Special Abilities. If your
character is a spellcaster there will be additional pages
displaying your spells. If multiple characters are loaded the names
of the characters will appear on tabs at the bottom of the
character sheet allowing you to switch between characters.

   The Preview Tab has an additional pane on the right which can be
accessed by clicking the arrow along the vertical border of the
window. This pane displays the character notes, the Equipsets and a
list of temporary bonuses which have been applied to the PC. The
radio button beside each Equipset indicates which Equipset is
currently being applied to the PC and displayed in the Preview Tab.
You can switch to another Equipset by simply clicking on the
corresponding radio button. Each temporary bonus has a check box on
it's left which indicate if it is active or not. Temporary bonuses
can be switched off and on with the check box which will update the
output of the Preview tab.
