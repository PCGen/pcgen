    Preview Tab
</h1>
<p>
    The Preview Tab displays all characters loaded in PCGen in a
    format similar to the output sheets PCGen exports to. Changes made
    to the character in PCGen are updated automatically in the Preview
    Tab at the time you make them. So, for example, if you were to
    apply the Rage bonuses from the Temporary Bonus Tab you would see
    these changes applied to your character when you returned to the
    Preview Tab.
</p>
<p>
    The tabs on the left allow you to navigate through the pages of
    the character sheet. Page contains the primary information such as
    name, ability scores, skills, hit points, etc.. Page 2 contains
    additional information such as Feats and Special Abilities. If your
    character is a spellcaster there will be additional pages
    displaying your spells. If multiple characters are loaded the names
    of the characters will appear on tabs at the bottom of the
    character sheet allowing you to switch between characters.

    The Preview Tab has an additional pane on the right which can be
    accessed by clicking the arrow along the vertical border of the
    window. This pane displays the character notes, the Equipsets and a
    list of temporary bonuses which have been applied to the PC. The
    radio button beside each Equipset indicates which Equipset is
    currently being applied to the PC and displayed in the Preview Tab.
    You can switch to another Equipset by simply clicking on the
    corresponding radio button. Each temporary bonus has a check box on
    it's left which indicate if it is active or not. Temporary bonuses
    can be switched off and on with the check box which will update the
    output of the Preview tab.
