<h1>
    Players Walkthrough Section
</h1>
<p>
    This is the starting point for creating a new PC within PCGen.
    Using the tabs that are listed the user will move throughout each
    one building the PC piece by piece until the finished PC is ready
    to be saved and/or exported. Following the tabs in order is the
    easiest way to make sure all sections of the PC are fleshed out and
    complete.
</p>
<p>
    Each tab is explained fully, and if you have any questions
    during use of PCGen, you can always use the 'Help on Context'
    option in the Menu, Help section. Using that option will bring up
    the exact page in the walkthrough documentation (This
    documentation) without the screenshot, only the text information,
    making it easier to match up what you see at the moment.
