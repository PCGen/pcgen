Here the user will choose which feats, loaded from the		sources, to add to the character.</p>				<p>The number in the upper-left contains the list of &#8216;Feats Remaining&#8217; to be chosen.</p>				<p>Next to the word &quot;Available&quot; is a selection box that lets the user pick		which &quot;view&quot; to use. It is this view, which will be used to determine		the structure of the table below it. The same is true for the		&quot;Selected&quot; feats, which list the feats already selected for the PC.</p>				<p>By default the feats for the PC'selected as optional feats are in black text in		the Selected table. Feats gained <strong>automatically</strong> (due to a race or class		property) are displayed in dark-yellow text. Feats gained <strong>virtually</strong>		(typically this means there's some restriction on them) are displayed in		magenta text. Virtual or automatic feats cannot be removed or changed the		selections of <strong>virtual</strong> or <strong>automatic feats</strong>. By clicking on the <strong>Filter		icons</strong> in the toolbar (the icons with the magnifying glass.)</p>				<p>To add a feat by double-clicking on it, right clicking on it or clicking on it and		the on the right-arrow button. Similarly to <strong>remove feats</strong>, or alter the		selections of optional feats which have choices, by double-clicking on it in		the &quot;Selected&quot; table, or by right-clicking on it there, or by		selecting it and then clicking on the left-arrow button above the table. As		elsewhere in PCGen anything that is not qualified for is in red italics.</p>				<p>The info-pane in the bottom-left will provide details about any feat clicked upon -		including any pre-requisites and its source.</p>		<!-- <p class="cvsfooter">$Source: /cvsroot/pcgendocs/pcgendocs/docs/tabpages/players/tabfeats.html,v $ ($Revision: 1.2 $) last updated $Date: 2004/04/04 20:24:21 $ by $Author: eddyanthony $</p> -->	</body></html>
