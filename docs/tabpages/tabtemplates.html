<h1>
    Templates Tab
</h1>
<p>
    Templates are generally meant to handle "permanent" adjustments
    and not situational ones. Examples of these are the
    <strong>
        Advanced Creature
    </strong>
    template from the RSRD and the
    Pathfinder core rules.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Main Tab: Template" src="../images/tabs/templatestab/tab_template_00.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The left pane displays the full list of templates available from
    the loaded data sets. Clicking on the
    <strong>
        Qualified
    </strong>
    button will remove all templates that have requirements that the
    current character does not meet. An example of one of these would
    be a race with an alignment requirement such as
    <strong>
        Trained
        Animal
    </strong>
    which requires, per the Pathfinder Core Rules, that
    the creature upon which it is applied must be an
    <strong>
        Animal
    </strong>
    with an intelligence of less than 3.
    Finally, you can use the
    <strong>
        Search
    </strong>
    field to find the
    template you are looking for.
</p>
<p>
    The right pane is where templates applied to the character
    appear, whether newly applied or applied previously. once its been
    selected.
</p>
<p>
    The lower pane is the
    <strong>
        Template Info
    </strong>
    pane. When
    you select a template in the left or right pane this pane will
    display the basic information for the selected template.
</p>
<p>
    Selecting a template is a simple process. Find and click on the
    desired template in the left pane and then click on the
    <strong>
        Add
        Template &gt;
    </strong>
    button. The template appears in the right
    pane and you are done.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to remove any applied templates, and assuming that
    the template is removable, you simply select the template listed in
    the right pane that is to be removed and click on the
    <strong>
        &lt;
        Remove Template
    </strong>
    button. The template will be removed from
    the character and from the right pane.
