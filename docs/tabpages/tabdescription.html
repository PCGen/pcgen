		<h1>Main Tab: Description</h1>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_00.png" alt="Main Tab: Description" /></p>

		<p>The <strong>Description </strong>tab
		allows the customization of the PC's features. It is possible to select the:
		height, weight, age, etc. all within this window and it will export that
		information to the Character sheet in the appropriate fields.</p>

		<p>The checkboxes next to each
		selection indicate that it can be selected for random information. Selecting
		the checkbox and then click on the <strong>Random</strong> button allows the selected
		fields to be filled with random information from a file included with PCGen.
		Unclick the checkbox will prevent the information from being random. There is
		no limit to the amount of times this can be done to randomize the information
		for the PC.</p>

		<p>The<strong> Check All </strong>button
		allows all the check boxes to be checked to save time from clicking on each
		one. The <strong>Uncheck All</strong> removes the checks from all the check boxes.</p>

		<p>To add a note to the PC, click on the <strong>Add</strong> button and input the name of the note
		to be described in. Then in the right hand window type the information that the
		note corresponds to.</p>

		<p>To delete a note, click on the note and select the <strong>Delete</strong> button. This will
		remove the note.</p>

		<p>To rename the note, click on the note and select the <strong>Rename</strong> button. This will
		allow the user to change the name of the note.</p>

		<p>To move a note from one object in the left hand window to the other, click on
		the note, select the <strong>Move</strong> button and then click on the location where the file
		will then reside on the right hand side. To undo the last <strong>Move</strong>
		selection, click the <strong>Revert</strong> button.</p>

	    <p>The DM Notes node is special as notes put in here will not be printed out on character 
	    sheets, keeping those particular notes safe from prying eyes!</p>

    	<p>To add a Picture to your character simply click on the browse button in the
  		bottom right hand corner and select a jpg file, this will add that image to
    	the list of images you can select from. Click on the refresh button next to
    	the name of the image to have it display in that pane.</p>
