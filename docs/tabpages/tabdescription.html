<p>The left pane of this tab lists a number of notes where
additional information on the current character can be stored.
There are a umber of standard notes provided by PCGen.</p>
<p>The <strong>Detail</strong> note is where the height, weight,
age, etc. are detailed. Each piece of detail has a checkbox next to
it. You can export this information to the Character sheet by
clicking on the adjacent checkbox. Clicking the
<strong>All</strong> button at the top of the
<strong>Detail</strong> note will export all detail included on the
page to the character sheet. Clicking the <strong>None</strong>
button will prohibit all of the date from being exported.</p>

<p class="center"><img src=
"../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_03_other.png" alt=
"Other Notes" /></p>
<p>PCgen's other standard notes are very similar in form and
function. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Bio</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Descriptions</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Companions</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Other Assets</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Magic Items</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>GM Notes</strong></li>
</ul>

will not be printed out on character sheets, keeping those
particular notes safe from prying eyes!</p>

<strong>Description</strong> tab by clicking on the <strong>Add
Note</strong> button. The new note will appear with a name of "New

above the new note.</p>
<p>To delete a note, click on the note and select the
