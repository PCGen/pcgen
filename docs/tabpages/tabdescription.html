    The
    <strong>
        Description
    </strong>
    tab allows the customization of
    the PC's features.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Description Tab" src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_00_details.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The left pane of this tab lists a number of notes where
    additional information on the current character can be stored.
    There are a number of standard notes provided by PCGen.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Detail
    </strong>
    note is where the height, weight,
    age, etc. are detailed. Each piece of detail has a checkbox next to
    it. You can export this information to the Character sheet by
    clicking on the adjacent checkbox. Clicking the
    <strong>
        All
    </strong>
    button at the top of the
    <strong>
        Detail
    </strong>
    note will export all detail included on the
    page to the character sheet. Clicking the
    <strong>
        None
    </strong>
    button will prohibit all of the date from being exported.

</p>
<p>
    The

<p class="center">
    <img alt="Other Notes" src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_03_other.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    PCgen's other standard notes are very similar in form and
    function. These include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Bio
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Descriptions
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Companions
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Other Assets
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            Magic Items
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            GM Notes
        </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        GM Notes
    </strong>
    is special as notes put in here
    will not be printed out on character sheets, keeping those
    particular notes safe from prying eyes!
</p>
<p>
    You can add your own note pages to the
    <strong>
        Description
    </strong>
    tab by clicking on the
    <strong>
        Add
        Note
    </strong>
    button. The new note will appear with a name of "New
    Note" in the right hand window and the top of the new note. To
    rename the note you will need to edit the name in the name field
    above the new note.
</p>
<p>
    To delete a note, click on the note and select the
    <strong>
