<h1>
    Feats and Abilities Tab
</h1>
<p>
    This is the
    <strong>
        Feats and Abilities
    </strong>
    tab. Here the
    user will choose which feats and abilities, to add to the
    character.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Main Tab: Feats" src="../images/tabs/featandabilitiestab/tab_featsandabilities_00_feats.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Feats and Abilities
    </strong>
    tab has a number of
    additional subtabs, starting with the
    <strong>
        Feats
    </strong>
    subtab. These subtabs, each representing a different category of
    abilities, will depend on the data sets loaded. Examples of some
    other categories of abilities you will see in PCGen's distributed
    data sets include
    <strong>
        Racial Abilities
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
        Racial
        Traits
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
        Class Abilities
    </strong>
    , and many more,
    and all panes have the same four panes.
</p>
<p>
    Next to the word "Available" is a selection box that lets the
    user pick which "view" to use. It is this view, which will be used
    to determine the structure of the table below it. The same is true
    for the "Selected" feats, which list the feats already selected for
    the PC.
</p>
<p>
    By default the feats and abilities for the PC selected as
    optional feats and abilities are shown in black text in the
    table. Feats and abilities gained
    <strong>
        automatically
    </strong>
    (due to a race or class ability or trait) are displayed in
    dark-yellow text. Feats and abilities gained
    <strong>
        virtually
    </strong>
    (typically this means there's some
    restriction on them) are displayed in magenta text.
    <strong>
        Virtual
    </strong>
    or
    <strong>
        Automatic
    </strong>
    feats and
    abilities cannot be removed. Nor can the selections of
    <strong>
        Virtual
    </strong>
    or
    <strong>
        Automatic
    </strong>
    feats and
    abilities be changed.
</p>
<p>
    To add a feat or ability to your character you click on it and
    then you click on the
    <strong>
        Add Selected &gt;
    </strong>
    button.
    You can also add an the desired item by double-clicking on it.
    Similarly, to remove a feat or ability, or to alter the internal
    selections of feats and abilities with such options, e.g.
    <strong>
        Weapon Focus (Longsword)
    </strong>
    , you double-clicking on
    it in the right pane. You can also select it in the right pane and
    then clicking on the
    <strong>
        &lt; Remove Selected
    </strong>
    beneath
    the pane. As elsewhere in PCGen anything that is not qualified for
    is in red italics.
</p>
<p>
    The info-pane in the bottom-right pane will display details
    about any feat clicked upon, including any prerequisites and its
    source.
