  <h1>
   Races Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Races
   </strong>
   tab is where you select your
race.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Main Tab: Races" src="../images/tabs/racestab/tab_race_00.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The left pane displays the full list of races available from the
loaded data sets. Besides PC races, this list also includes all
monster races. Clicking on the
   <strong>
    No Racial HD
   </strong>
   button
will remove all races that have inherent hit dice. Clicking on the
   <strong>
    Qualified
   </strong>
   button will remove all races that have
requirements that the current character does not meet. An example
of this would be a race with an alignment requirement. Finally, you
can use the
   <strong>
    Search
   </strong>
   field to find the race you are
looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
   The right pane is where the character's race appears once its
been selected. If the race was selected from the
   <strong>
    Summary
   </strong>
   tab the race selected will already be
listed here. In that case, if you continue and select another race,
as each character can only have one race, the previous race will be
replaced with the new one.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lower pane is the
   <strong>
    Race Info
   </strong>
   pane. When you
select a race in the left or right pane this pane will display the
basic information for the selected race.
  </p>
  <p>
   Selecting a race is a simple process. Find and click on the
desired race in the left pane and then click on the
   <strong>
    Select
Race &gt;
   </strong>
   button. The race appears in the right pane and
you are done.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you wish to change the selected race you will select the race
lisrted in the right pane and then click on the
   <strong>
    &lt;
Unselect Race
   </strong>
   button. The race will be removed from the
right pane. Now you can proceed to select a new race.
