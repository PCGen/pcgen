  <h1>
   Temporary Bonus Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   The Temporary Bonus Tab is used to apply conditional bonuses to
your character such as Spell effects, bonuses due to Rage, having a
familiar within 5 feet of your character and more. Normally PCGen
will only apply absolute bonuses to your character, for example if
you you equip your character with a Belt of Giant Strength he gets
a bonus to his strength score because wearing the belt is the only
condition that needs to be met. If however your character is of a
class that gets a +2 to Hide but only when he's in a forest
environment then PCGen will not apply the bonus to the Skill on the
character sheet although there may be an entry in a Special Ability
noting this bonus. This is where the Temporary Bonus Tab comes into
play, these conditional bonuses can be applied and removed from
characters as needed and the bonuses will then show up on the
character sheets. You could then for example apply the Rage bonuses
and print out a second character sheet with these bonuses applied
saving you the time of manually adding these in.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Temporary Bonus Tab" src="../images/tabs/tempbonustab/tab_tempbonus_00.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The panel on the top left displays all the conditional bonuses
available to the character while the panel on the top right
displays the conditional bonuses currently applied to the active
character.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Applying a Temporary Bonus Target" src="../images/tabs/tempbonustab/tab_tempbonus_02_applying.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   To apply one of the conditional bonuses, select the bonus and
then press the
   <strong>
    Apply Bonus &gt;
   </strong>
   button. If the
target of the bonus is the PC, the bonus title will appear in the
right pane. If the bonus applies to a piece of gear
carried by the character, e.g. a weapon or piece of armor, the
target selection dialog will appear.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Temporary Bonus Target" src="../images/tabs/tempbonustab/tab_tempbonus_02_target.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Select the target of the bonus and click on the
   <strong>
    Add
   </strong>
   button. The bonus and the appropriate
descriptive information will appear in the bottom panel, listing
details of the bonus. Now click the
   <strong>
    Ok
   </strong>
   button and
if the piece of equipment which has had the bonus applied to it is
"Equipped", the temporary bonus will be applied to your character
and appear on the output sheet.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Temporary Bonus Applied" src="../images/tabs/tempbonustab/tab_tempbonus_02_applied.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Removing the bonus from the target is as simple as selecting the
bonus in the right-hand pane and clicking the
   <strong>
    &lt; Remove
Bonus
   </strong>
   button.

  <h4>
   How to Code Temporary Bonuses.
  </h4>
  <p>
   A conditional bonus can be added to a Feat, Spell, Item, Class
or Template by including a BONUS tag with a PREAPPLY tag appended.
Any bonus with a PREAPPLY tag on it will show up in (and only in)
the
   <strong>
    Temporary Bonus
   </strong>
   tab. See the tag dictionary
entry on
   <a href="../listfilepages/globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#preapply">
    PREAPPLY
   </a>
   for details on how to use this tag. Also see the tag
   <a href="../listfilepages/globalfilestagpages/globalfilesother.html#tempdesc">
    TEMPDESC
   </a>
   which provides a description of the bonus and the
circumstances needed for it to be valid.
  </p>
  <p>
   An example of what is required to get this tab to work is:
  </p>
  <p>
   The Rapid Shot feat in
   <span class="lstfile">
    srdfeats.lst
   </span>
   would be modified to:
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT|-2|PREAPPLY:Weapon,Ranged</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:WEAPON|ATTACKS|1|PREAPPLY:Weapon,Ranged</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Rapid Shot would then appear in this tab as an available
option.
  </p>
  <p>
   A BONUS in a Spell, Feat or Template with a PREAPPLY:ANYPC tag
will always show up in the Spell, Feat or Template lists of the
Temporary Bonus Sub-Tab. This accounts for spells that can be cast
on a character and Feats and Templates that can be used to hold a
conditional bonus any character can apply without having the Feat
or Template. This allows for several things:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    You can apply bonuses from spells 'cast on' your character
   </li>
   <li>
    You can create templates or feats that do not have to be
obtained, but your character can still gain the bonuses.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   You can use #2 as a Hidden feat or template that is used to
"store" the bonuses for something else. Here is an example
template:
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>Alter Self (Troglodyte)</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>REMOVABLE:YES  
VISIBLE:NO</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:COMBAT|AC|6|TYPE=NaturalArmor|PREAPPLY:ANYPC</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>TEMPDESC:Alter Self spell applied to a
Medium sized creature to transform into a Troglodyte</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   You do not have to apply this template to a PC, I can just add
it as a Bonus on the
   <strong>
    Temporary Bonus
   </strong>
   tab.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h4>
   Coding variable bonuses.
  </h4>
  <p>
   Some Spells, like Bull's Strength for example, provide a
variable bonus based on a die roll (1d4+1). These spells can be
coded to accept user input by adding a choose tag. Take Bull's
Strength as an example.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Bull's Strength spell in
   <span class="lstfile">
    srdspells.lst
   </span>
   would be modified to:
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:STAT|STR|%CHOICE|PREAPPLY:ANYPC|TYPE=Enhancement</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>CHOOSE:NUMBER|MIN=2|MAX=5|TITLE=Roll
1d4+1</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   When Bull's Strength is applied to the character a chooser
window will pop up titled 'Roll 1d4+1' which asks for a number
between 2 and 5.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spells that grant bonuses dependent on the spellcasters level
can be treated in a similar manner. For this example we will use
Greater Magic Weapon, which grants a bonus of +1 for every 3
casterlevels up to 5.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Greater Magic Weapon spell in
   <span class="lstfile">
    srdspells.lst
   </span>
   would be modified to:
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT,DAMAGE|(((%CHOICE/3).TRUNC)MAX1)MIN5|PREAPPLY:Weapon|TYPE=Enhancement</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>CHOOSE:NUMBER|MIN=3|MAX=20|TITLE=Choose
Spell Caster Level</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   When Greater Magic Weapon is applied to a character's weapon a
chooser window will pop up titled 'Choose Spell Caster Level' which
asks for a number between 3 (the minimum casterlevel) and 20. The
bonus is calculated based on the casterlevel and applied to the
weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   Feats and Templates can be treated in the same manner. Here is
an example feat:
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>Variable Spell Resistance</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>VISIBLE:No</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>TYPE:TemporaryBonus</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>BONUS:MISC|SR|%CHOICE|PREAPPLY:ANYPC</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>CHOOSE:NUMBER|MIN=1|MAX=40|TITLE=Choose
Spell Resistance</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>TEMPDESC:Assign Spell Resistance to a
character</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The PC does not need to select this feat, you simply apply the
bonus to the PC on the
   <strong>
    Temporary Bonus
   </strong>
   tab.
