		<h1> Tab Options</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/tabs.png" alt="Main Menu Options" /></p>
		
		<p>PCGen has a number of different Tab sets to help navigate between the different character creation screens:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Main Tabs:</strong><br />
			These allow you to change between the Sources that you have loaded and the
			different characters you are currently working on.</p></li>
			
			<li><p><strong>Character Tabs:</strong><br />
			These only appear if a Character's Main tab has been selected. They allow you to move around and change the 
			character.</p></li>
			
			<li><p><strong>Sub Tabs:</strong><br />
			When certain Character Tabs are selected, additional sub tabs will appear that
			allow further navigation. (E.g. Inventory has Gear, Equipping, Resources and Temporary
			Bonuses).</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Click on the desired Tab with the mouse and the screen will change to display
		that section.</p>
		
		<h1>Common interface elements</h1>
		
		<p>Many tabs in PCGen have common interface elements to aid in finding and sorting through the lists.</p>
		
		<p>The Filter field allows you to search for items by any text you enter, 
		PCGen will display only those items which have names or types that match the text entered, 
		this is the reason the Kukri is displayed when filtering for the word &quot;dagger&quot;, it has the &quot;Dagger&quot; type. 
		If you have applied any other filters by using the Filter tool 
		the text filter will limit it's search to those not filtered out by the filter tool. 
		In other words the items displayed will match both the Filter tool and the text Filter.</p>
		
		<p>On the right side of many of the lists column label row is a small icon with three dots in it 
		<img src="../images/tabs/column_icon.png">. 
		When clicked this will produce a pop up menu displaying all the possible columns the list can display 
		with a check mark beside each item currently enabled. 
		Selecting any item will change it's state from either being displayed or hidden.</p>
