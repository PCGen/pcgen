</p>
<p>
    PCGen has a number of different Tab sets to help navigate
    between the different character creation screens:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Main Tabs:
            </strong>
            <br/>
            These allow you to change between the currently loaded
            characters.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Character Tabs:
            </strong>
            <br/>
            These only appear if a Character's Main tab has been selected. They
            allow you to move around and change the character.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Sub Tabs:
            </strong>
            <br/>
            When certain Character Tabs are selected, additional sub tabs will
            appear that allow further navigation. (i.e. The Inventory tab has
            the Purchase and Equipment sub-tabs).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Click on the desired Tab with the mouse and the screen will
    change to display that section.
</p>
<h1>
    Common interface elements
</h1>
<p>
    Many tabs in PCGen have common interface elements to aid in
    finding and sorting through the lists.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Search
    </strong>
    field allows you to search for items
    by any text you enter, PCGen will display only those items which
    have names or types that match the text entered, this is the reason
    the Kukri is displayed when filtering for the word "dagger", it has
    the "Dagger" type. If you have applied any other filters by using
    the Filter tool the text filter will limit its search to those not
    filtered out by the filter tool. In other words the items displayed
    will match both the Filter tool and the text Filter.
</p>
<p>
    On the right side of many of the lists column label row is a
    small icon with three dots in it
    <img alt="column_icon.png" src="../images/tabs/column_icon.png"/>
    . When
    clicked this will produce a pop up menu displaying all the possible
    columns the list can display with a check mark beside each item
    currently enabled. Selecting any item will change it's state from
    either being displayed or hidden.
</p>
<p>
    Most tabs display lists of items, be they equipment, feats,
    classes, templates, etc., many of which the character being worked
    will not
    <strong>
        Qualify
    </strong>
    for. This generally is caused by
    the presence of a prerequisite that the character does not meet.
    These items will appear in red text.
