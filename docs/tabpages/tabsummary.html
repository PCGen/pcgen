  <h1>
   Summary Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Summary
   </strong>
   tab is the starting point through
which the user will build the PC. The tab is designed to speed up
character creation by having the most commonly used aspects
available for quick access.
  </p>

  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Things to be Done" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_01_things.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Things to be Done
   </strong>
   pane provides a list of
ot-links that, well, list things to be done. Clicking on the link
will take you to the Tab where the task can be completed. As you
complete each item it will be removed from the list.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Character Name
   </strong>
   field is for the name of the
actual character for in play use/reference.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Naming the Character" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_02_name.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   If creating names from scratch is not your forte, you can use
the
   <strong>
    Random
   </strong>
   button found to the left of the
   <strong>
    Character Name
   </strong>
   field. This button will pop up a
window giving you options to create a new name for your PC.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Tab Label
   </strong>
   text field is allows you to add
to your character's name as well as to change how your character's
name appears on the tab labels within PCGen. So if your Character
name was "Bob the Headsman", and you added "The Squimish" to the
   <strong>
    Tab Label
   </strong>
   field, the character output and tab
labels within PCGen would display "The Squimish".
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Player Name
   </strong>
   text field is for your name, so
that when the GM has a stack of 50 characters, and he doesn't
remember who's character is whose by the character name, it makes
their life easier.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Alignment
   </strong>
   drop down menu is to select your
characters alignment.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img align="middle" alt="Character Race" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_03_race.png"/>
   <img align="middle" alt="Selecting a Character Race" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_03_raceselect.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Race
   </strong>
   drop down menu is used for quick
access to the races available from the source materials you have
loaded.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img align="middle" alt="Character Class" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_06_class.png"/>
   <img align="middle" alt="Selecting a Character Class" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_06_classselect.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Class
   </strong>
   drop down menu is used for quick
access to the classes available from the source materials you have
loaded. Classes that appear in red contain prerequisites that the
character does not meet. As an example, Druids require that the
character have an "Alignment" of some flavor of "Neutral".
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Add Levels
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Remove
Levels
   </strong>
   section contains 3 elements:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A text field where you can manually enter the level you want to
add/remove. The field is automatically loaded with a value of
"1".
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     +
    </strong>
    button will add the levels indicated in
the text field above.
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     -
    </strong>
    button will remove the levels indicated
in the text field above.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Creating a Default Monster" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_09_monster.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Create Monster
   </strong>
   button opens the
   <a href="../menupages/edit/editaddkitoptions.html">
    Add Kit
   </a>
   window,
allowing you to apply any kits your character qualifies for,
including any Default Monster Kit. As long as you have not selected
a Race the full list of Default Monster Kits will be available to
select from. This is the fast way to create monsters, create a new
character and add a Default Monster Kit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Ability Point Total
   </strong>
   reports how many total
character stat points you have used (Starting at zero).
