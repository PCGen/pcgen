<h1>
    Summary Tab
</h1>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Summary
    </strong>
    tab is the starting point through
    which the user will build the PC. The tab is designed to speed up
    character creation by having the most commonly used aspects
    available for quick access.
</p>

</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Things to be Done" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_01_things.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Things to be Done
    </strong>
    pane provides a list of
    ot-links that, well, list things to be done. Clicking on the link
    will take you to the Tab where the task can be completed. As you
    complete each item it will be removed from the list.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Character Name
    </strong>
    field is for the name of the
    actual character for in play use/reference.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="Naming the Character" src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_02_name.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    If creating names from scratch is not your forte, you can use
    the
    <strong>
        Random
    </strong>
    button found to the left of the
    <strong>
        Character Name
    </strong>
    field. This button will pop up a
    window giving you options to create a new name for your PC.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Tab Label
    </strong>
    text field is allows you to add
    to your character's name as well as to change how your character's
    name appears on the tab labels within PCGen. So if your Character
    name was "Bob the Headsman", and you added "The Squimish" to the
    <strong>
        Tab Label
    </strong>
    field, the character output and tab
    labels within PCGen would display "The Squimish".
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Player Name
    </strong>
    text field is for your name, so
    that when the GM has a stack of 50 characters, and he doesn't
    remember who's character is whose by the character name, it makes
    their life easier.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Alignment
    </strong>
    drop down menu is to select your
    characters alignment.

</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Race
    </strong>
    drop down menu is used for quick
    access to the races available from the source materials you have
    loaded.

</p>
<p>
    The
    <strong>
        Class
    </strong>
    drop down menu is used for quick
    access to the classes available from the source materials you have
    loaded. Classes that appear in red contain prerequisites that the
    character does not meet. As an example, Druids require that the
    character have an "Alignment" of some flavor of "Neutral".
</p>
<p>
    The

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A text field where you can manually enter the level you want to
        add/remove. The field is automatically loaded with a value of
        "1".
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            +
        </strong>
        button will add the levels indicated in
        the text field above.
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <strong>
            -
        </strong>
        button will remove the levels indicated
        in the text field above.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="center">

    allowing you to apply any kits your character qualifies for,
    including any Default Monster Kit. As long as you have not selected
    a Race the full list of Default Monster Kits will be available to

    character and add a Default Monster Kit.
