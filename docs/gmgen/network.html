<h1>Network Tab</h1>
<p>The network plug-in allows GMGen to act as a Client-Server
application connecting multiple computers running PCGen. Players
load their characters on their computers and activate the network
client. The GM, running the network server, can see all the PC
information that is available inside of the Initiative plugin.
Either side will be able to change hitpoints, status, initiative
and that sort of thing for the PC. In the Experience plugin, it
will allow the GM to assign experience, and it will send it to the
PC over the network.</p>

<strong>PCGen Network Client</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p>
<p>1) When you enter the tab, and click on the 'server' radio
button, it starts the server. The server binds to port 80, but you
can set the port in the GMGen preferences.</p>
<p>2) Players will need to go to the <a href=
"preferences.html#NETWORK">GMGen preferences</a> and each one will
need to select a "user name", and change the port (if you changed
the port on your server).</p>
<p>3) The players will need to type your ip address in the box and
hit connect to connect to your server - once they do, you as the GM
will get all of their logs.</p>
<p>4) Currently (but this will be fixed in the future) every time
the pc enters or leaves the Initiative tab, it will send the GM all
loaded player characters. eventually, I will make it so it can
catch events on the pc side, to instantly send any changes.</p>
