   Initiative Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   The Initiative Tab is the heart of GMGens combat tracking
system. The Initiative Tab aids in tracking initiative, hit point
loss, spells in effect and more. Looking over the tab you will see
a row of buttons across the top, these buttons relate to initiative
control and manipulation. The pane in the middle of the tab is
split in two. On the left side is a list of all characters involved
in combat along with the status of certain vital statistics. On the
right side is a collection of tabs which display character
information in a stat block format as well as a tab displaying any
events which may be in effect. Along the bottom of the tab is
another set of buttons which perform functions related to the
status of the characters. Details instructions for running combat
with GMGen are given below.

  <h2>
   Using the Initiative Tab
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
   <h3>
    Opening and Saving
   </h3>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The state of the Initiative Tab can be saved to a file and
opened at a later date. This is useful if you wish to set up
encounters before hand and save time at the game table as well as
for those times when the session must be ended before combat has
been resolved. You may save the Initiative state at any time by
choosing Save from the file menu. You may open previously saved
combats by choosing Open from the File menu. GMGen will load all
the characters involved in the combat in PCGen and add them to the
Initiative Tab. If you already have other characters open in PCGen
then opening a combat will add the characters to those already
open, because of this you may need to quit PCGen and restart to get
a clean open of your previously saved combat. Closing all
characters in PCGen may accomplish this as well. All characters
must be saved prior to saving the initiative state or it will not
open. GMGen will present a Save dialog box for any unsaved
characters before saving the initiative state.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <h3>
    Setting up
   </h3>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   To run a combat scene with GMGen the first thing you will want
to do is bring in all the characters involved in combat. First load
all the player characters and/or NPC's you may have pre-generated
into PCGen. You can do this in PCGen or in the Characters Tab of
GMGen. Once loaded the characters will appear in the Initiative
Tab. Next you will want to add enemy combatants, there are two ways
to do this. The first is by adding them through the GMGen
   <a href="encounter.html">
    Encounter Tab
   </a>
   , see the instructions for using
that tab. The second way is to click the Add Combatant button from
the top row. The Add Combatant button provides a convenient way to
add combatants to the initiative list without generating new
characters in PCGen, see details on this feature below.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Initiative list layout.
   </strong>
   The list has several
columns in it each displaying a combat related statistic. They are
as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <strong>
     #
    </strong>
    displays the initiative order of the
character based on the characters initiative roll.
    <br/>
    <strong>
     Name
    </strong>
    displays the name of the character.
    <br/>
    <strong>
     Player
    </strong>
    displays the name of the player.
    <br/>
    <strong>
     Status
    </strong>
    displays the current status of the
character. This can include Dead, Unconscious, etc..
    <br/>
    <strong>
     +
    </strong>
    displays the characters initiative bonus.
    <br/>
    <strong>
     Init
    </strong>
    displays the characters initiative
roll.
    <br/>
    <strong>
     Dur
    </strong>
    displays the duration of the event (this
applies only to events, for characters duration is blank).
    <br/>
    <strong>
     HP
    </strong>
    displays the characters current hit points. Any
subdual damage the character has taken will be displayed to the
right of the regular hit points.
    <br/>
    <strong>
     HP Max
    </strong>
    displays the characters normal full hit
point total.
    <br/>
    <strong>
     Type
    </strong>
    displays the characters assigned combatant
type. Must be either PC, Enemy, Ally or Non-combatant. Only Enemy
combatants will appear in the Experience tab once killed. You may
change this setting by clicking directly on the type in the list, a
drop down menu will appear and allow you to select a new type.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   If you wish to set up encounters prior to game time you can save
the state of the initiative tab by choosing
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   from the
   <strong>
    File
   </strong>
   menu and giving it a name. This is
also useful if you need to end a game before an encounter has been
resolved. Simply save the encounter and open it during the next
game session.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <h3>
    Starting combat
   </h3>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Once you have all the characters involved in combat loaded in
the initiative tab you can begin combat rounds by clicking the
   <strong>
    Start Combat
   </strong>
   button. This will reset the combat
round counter, roll initiative for all characters in the initiative
tab and order them according to their initiative roll. If you wish
your players to roll for their characters you can enter that roll
manually in the Init column. The round number is indicated by the
number in the upper right side of the tab, the number in
parentheses indicates the initiative turn that is currently active.
The buttons next to Start Combat button all relate to controlling
the initiative sequence, their functions are detailed individually
below.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Start Combat:
   </strong>
   this button resets the combat
round counter, rolls initiative for all characters in the
initiative tab and orders them according to their initiative
roll.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Add Combatant:
   </strong>
   This button will bring up a
dialogue box where you can enter combat related stats of the
combatant you wish to add.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="add_combatant.png" src="../images/gmgen/plugins/initiative/gmgen_06_combatant.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   You can type in the name of the PC and the name of the player.
The Bonus field is the initiative bonus of the combatant. You can
enter the hit points of the combatant using the slider or by typing
the number into the field. The Number field is the number of
combatants you wish to add with these stats, multiple combatants
will share the same name and each will have a number to
differentiate them. You can also enter the combatants ability
scores and saving throw bonuses. Keep in mind that the info visible
in the initiative list can be edited directly in the list but the
stats not listed (such as Ability scores) cannot be changed once
set. Once you are done entering information click save and the
newly created combatants will appear in the initiative list. Adding
combatants in this way will not create new PCGen character files
though the enemies will appear in the experience tab once
killed.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Next Initiative:
   </strong>
   This button will move the
round counter to the next lower character initiative and highlight
characters with that initiative. If multiple characters have the
same initiative they will all be highlighted. Initiative numbers
not being used by any characters or events are skipped. If the
current character has the lowest initiative score the Next
Initiative button will raise the round counter to the next round
and highlight the character with the highest initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Refocus:
   </strong>
   The Refocus button will set the
selected characters initiative to the maximum score (20 + the
characters initiative bonus) and arrange him in the list according
to the new result.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Roll:
   </strong>
   The Roll button will re-roll the
initiative for the character selected and arrange him in the list
according to the new result.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Delete:
   </strong>
   The Delete button will remove the
selected character from the initiative list. Deleting a character
will also remove the character from the experience tab if they are
dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Refresh Tabs:
   </strong>
   This button will manually update
the information in the stat block tabs to the right. This is only
needed if you have set the
   <a href="preferences.html#performance">
    GMGen preferences
   </a>
   to not update
on state change.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <h3>
    Managing combat
   </h3>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Once you have clicked the
   <strong>
    Start Combat
   </strong>
   button
and combat has begun the next step is to click the
   <strong>
    Next
Initiative
   </strong>
   button. This will set the round counter to
round 1 and highlight the combatant with the highest initiative.
Along the bottom of the Initiative Tab are a series of buttons and
checkboxes which preform various functions relating to actions
taken during combat, their functions are detailed individually
below. Most of these button will apply a direct effect to the
combatant or combatants currently selected. The
   <strong>
    Next
Initiative
   </strong>
   button will select the next combatant so if you
want to apply an action to another combatant you must first select
that combatant.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Cast Spell:
   </strong>
   The Cast Spell button will open the
Cast Spell window where you may enter the name of the spell along
with other information to help you keep track of the spell and its
effects.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Casting a Spell" src="../images/gmgen/plugins/initiative/gmgen_06_castspell.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The "Player" field will default to the character selected when
the Cast Spell button was pressed. For Effect you can enter
information to help remind you of the effects of the spell.
Duration allows you to set how many rounds the spell will be in
effect for. Initiative will be picked up from the casting character
but can be altered if you wish. When the "Alert when spell duration
expires" checkbox is checked an alert box will pop up at the end of
the spells duration to remind you.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Spell Duration Expires" src="../images/gmgen/plugins/initiative/gmgen_06_castexpired.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Start Event:
   </strong>
   The Event Timer functions in
exactly the same way as Cast Spell dialogue box does but can be
used to keep track of Raging characters, Bardic music, bad weather
or any situation with a limited time duration you might need to
track. Its also useful as a countdown for events that will occur in
future rounds.
  </p>
  <p class="center">

  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Roll Save:
   </strong>
   This button will open the Saving
Throw dialogue box. You may use it to roll a saving throw by
selecting either Fortitude, Reflex or Will, setting the Difficulty
Class of the roll and clicking the roll button. This will cause an
alert window to display the Roll result, the bonus, the total and
the Pass/Fail result of the roll. When the Saving Throw window
initially appears no save type will be selected and you may use it
with any numbers you care to enter.

    Damage:
   </strong>
   The Damage button will allow you to

status changes to Bleeding and they will lose 1 hit point per round
until they are either stabilized or reach -10 HP and die. If a
character has taken an amount of subdual damage equal to their
