<h1>
    Initiative Tab
</h1>
<p>
    The Initiative Tab is the heart of GMGens combat tracking
    system. The Initiative Tab aids in tracking initiative, hit point
    loss, spells in effect and more. Looking over the tab you will see
    a row of buttons across the top, these buttons relate to initiative
    control and manipulation. The pane in the middle of the tab is
    split in two. On the left side is a list of all characters involved
    in combat along with the status of certain vital statistics. On the
    right side is a collection of tabs which display character
    information in a stat block format as well as a tab displaying any
    events which may be in effect. Along the bottom of the tab is
    another set of buttons which perform functions related to the
    status of the characters. Details instructions for running combat
    with GMGen are given below.

<h2>
    Using the Initiative Tab
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <h3>
        Opening and Saving
    </h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The state of the Initiative Tab can be saved to a file and
    opened at a later date. This is useful if you wish to set up
    encounters before hand and save time at the game table as well as
    for those times when the session must be ended before combat has
    been resolved. You may save the Initiative state at any time by
    choosing Save from the file menu. You may open previously saved
    combats by choosing Open from the File menu. GMGen will load all
    the characters involved in the combat in PCGen and add them to the
    Initiative Tab. If you already have other characters open in PCGen
    then opening a combat will add the characters to those already
    open, because of this you may need to quit PCGen and restart to get
    a clean open of your previously saved combat. Closing all
    characters in PCGen may accomplish this as well. All characters
    must be saved prior to saving the initiative state or it will not
    open. GMGen will present a Save dialog box for any unsaved
    characters before saving the initiative state.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <h3>
        Setting up
    </h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
    To run a combat scene with GMGen the first thing you will want
    to do is bring in all the characters involved in combat. First load
    all the player characters and/or NPC's you may have pre-generated
    into PCGen. You can do this in PCGen or in the Characters Tab of
    GMGen. Once loaded the characters will appear in the Initiative
    Tab. Next you will want to add enemy combatants, there are two ways
    to do this. The first is by adding them through the GMGen
    <a href="encounter.html">
        Encounter Tab
    </a>
    , see the instructions for using
    that tab. The second way is to click the Add Combatant button from
    the top row. The Add Combatant button provides a convenient way to
    add combatants to the initiative list without generating new
    characters in PCGen, see details on this feature below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Initiative list layout.
    </strong>
    The list has several
    columns in it each displaying a combat related statistic. They are
    as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>
            #
        </strong>
        displays the initiative order of the
        character based on the characters initiative roll.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Name
        </strong>
        displays the name of the character.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Player
        </strong>
        displays the name of the player.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Status
        </strong>
        displays the current status of the
        character. This can include Dead, Unconscious, etc..
        <br/>
        <strong>
            +
        </strong>
        displays the characters initiative bonus.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Init
        </strong>
        displays the characters initiative
        roll.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Dur
        </strong>
        displays the duration of the event (this
        applies only to events, for characters duration is blank).
        <br/>
        <strong>
            HP
        </strong>
        displays the characters current hit points. Any
        subdual damage the character has taken will be displayed to the
        right of the regular hit points.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            HP Max
        </strong>
        displays the characters normal full hit
        point total.
        <br/>
        <strong>
            Type
        </strong>
        displays the characters assigned combatant
        type. Must be either PC, Enemy, Ally or Non-combatant. Only Enemy
        combatants will appear in the Experience tab once killed. You may
        change this setting by clicking directly on the type in the list, a
        drop down menu will appear and allow you to select a new type.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If you wish to set up encounters prior to game time you can save
    the state of the initiative tab by choosing
    <strong>
        Save
    </strong>
    from the
    <strong>
        File
    </strong>
    menu and giving it a name. This is
    also useful if you need to end a game before an encounter has been
    resolved. Simply save the encounter and open it during the next
    game session.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <h3>
        Starting combat
    </h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Once you have all the characters involved in combat loaded in
    the initiative tab you can begin combat rounds by clicking the
    <strong>
        Start Combat
    </strong>
    button. This will reset the combat
    round counter, roll initiative for all characters in the initiative
    tab and order them according to their initiative roll. If you wish
    your players to roll for their characters you can enter that roll
    manually in the Init column. The round number is indicated by the
    number in the upper right side of the tab, the number in
    parentheses indicates the initiative turn that is currently active.
    The buttons next to Start Combat button all relate to controlling
    the initiative sequence, their functions are detailed individually
    below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Start Combat:
    </strong>
    this button resets the combat
    round counter, rolls initiative for all characters in the
    initiative tab and orders them according to their initiative
    roll.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Add Combatant:
    </strong>
    This button will bring up a
    dialogue box where you can enter combat related stats of the
    combatant you wish to add.
</p>
<p class="center">
    <img alt="add_combatant.png" src="../images/gmgen/plugins/initiative/gmgen_06_combatant.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    You can type in the name of the PC and the name of the player.
    The Bonus field is the initiative bonus of the combatant. You can
    enter the hit points of the combatant using the slider or by typing
    the number into the field. The Number field is the number of
    combatants you wish to add with these stats, multiple combatants
    will share the same name and each will have a number to
    differentiate them. You can also enter the combatants ability
    scores and saving throw bonuses. Keep in mind that the info visible
    in the initiative list can be edited directly in the list but the
    stats not listed (such as Ability scores) cannot be changed once
    set. Once you are done entering information click save and the
    newly created combatants will appear in the initiative list. Adding
    combatants in this way will not create new PCGen character files
    though the enemies will appear in the experience tab once
    killed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Next Initiative:
    </strong>
    This button will move the
    round counter to the next lower character initiative and highlight
    characters with that initiative. If multiple characters have the
    same initiative they will all be highlighted. Initiative numbers
    not being used by any characters or events are skipped. If the
    current character has the lowest initiative score the Next
    Initiative button will raise the round counter to the next round
    and highlight the character with the highest initiative.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Refocus:
    </strong>
    The Refocus button will set the
    selected characters initiative to the maximum score (20 + the
    characters initiative bonus) and arrange him in the list according
    to the new result.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Roll:
    </strong>
    The Roll button will re-roll the
    initiative for the character selected and arrange him in the list
    according to the new result.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Delete:
    </strong>
    The Delete button will remove the
    selected character from the initiative list. Deleting a character
    will also remove the character from the experience tab if they are
    dead.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Refresh Tabs:
    </strong>
    This button will manually update
    the information in the stat block tabs to the right. This is only
    needed if you have set the
    <a href="preferences.html#performance">
        GMGen preferences
    </a>
    to not update
    on state change.

    Along the bottom of the Initiative Tab are a series of buttons and
    checkboxes which preform various functions relating to actions
    taken during combat, their functions are detailed individually
    below. Most of these button will apply a direct effect to the
    combatant or combatants currently selected. The
    <strong>
        Next

<p>
    <strong>
        Cast Spell:
    </strong>
    The Cast Spell button will open the
    Cast Spell window where you may enter the name of the spell along
    with other information to help you keep track of the spell and its
    effects.

</p>
<p>
    The "Player" field will default to the character selected when
    the Cast Spell button was pressed. For Effect you can enter
    information to help remind you of the effects of the spell.
    Duration allows you to set how many rounds the spell will be in
    effect for. Initiative will be picked up from the casting character
    but can be altered if you wish. When the "Alert when spell duration
    expires" checkbox is checked an alert box will pop up at the end of
    the spells duration to remind you.
</p>
<p class="center">

    exactly the same way as Cast Spell dialogue box does but can be
    used to keep track of Raging characters, Bardic music, bad weather
    or any situation with a limited time duration you might need to
    track. Its also useful as a countdown for events that will occur in
    future rounds.
</p>
<p class="center">
