    Encounter Tab

</p>
<p>
    The Encounter tab allows you to select creatures that will be
    used in the Initiative tab.
</p>
<p>
    The left pane of the window lists all of the races for the
    sources loaded in PCGen. You select the monsters that you wish to
    use in the upcoming encounter by double clicking on the monster's
    name or click on the Add (&gt;) button located between the two
    panes. To remove double click on the monster listed in the right
    hand pane or click on the Remove (&lt;) button located between the
    two panes.
</p>
<p>
    Another option is to all GMGen to generate an encounter by
    clicking on the "New Encounter" button on the left of the window.
    If the "Environment" is set to "Generic", you can alter the EL
    (Encounter Level) and the Number of Creatures before clicking "New
    Encounter" and GMGen will randomly select an appropriate encounter.
    If the "Level 1 Dungeon" environment is selected, GMGen generates
    an encounter from a preset list.
</p>
<p>
    As you add and remove monsters from the encounter, the "Total
    Encounter Level" shown at the bottom of the window will
    automatically change.
</p>
<p>
    When you are happy with the contents of the right hand pane and
    wish to start the combat, click on the "Begin Combat" button. GMGen
    will then create blank character entities in PCGen. You can then
    alter the possessions levels, skills, feats, equipment etc. as
    normal in PCGen. If you wish to save the encounter for use later,
    in PCGen use File &gt; Party &gt; Save. The monsters will also
    automatically appear on the "Initiative" tab as enemies.
