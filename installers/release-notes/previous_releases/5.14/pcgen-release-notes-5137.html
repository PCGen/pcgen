		<h2><a name="WhatsNew">What's new for v5.13.7</a></h2>

		<p>PCGen v5.13.7 is an alpha release from our development branch to allow 
			experimentation and testing of our latest work. The main change in this release
			is the implementation of the new data-set installation command.</p>

		<h3>New Sources</h3>

		<p>The following new sources were added in 5.13.7</p>

		<ul>
			<li>[Silven Publishing] Curses!</li>
			<li>[AEG] Feats</li>
		</ul>


		<h2><a name="Chars">Character Changes</a></h2>

		<p>We've been making some major changes behind the scenes to the way special 
			abilities for characters are handled. The benefit is that it lets us 
			model them more accurately, with fighter feats tracked separately to normal 
			feats for example, and that we can output them more accurately on the character 
			sheet or stat block. However there is a downside - this means that there is some 
			migration required for some characters. For details of what you need to do, see 
			the sections for the affected game modes below.</p>
		<p>This revamp of abilities is something we would like your feedback on. So please have a play 
			with them and send your thoughts to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen">PCGen list</a>.</p>

		<h3>Fantasy Character Changes</h3>

		<p>When a pre-generated SRD (3rd ed) or RSRD (3.5 ed) ranger, archmage or high level rogue 
			character is loaded, it will not recognize
			the selected abilities anymore. For that reason one or more error
			messages will be displayed at character load, which read: "Warning:
			Unable to Find Ability: xxx", where xxx is the name of an ability that
			the character had previously selected.</p>
		<p>To fix this problem, you can take the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Write down the abilities that are mentioned in those error messages somewhere.</li>
			<li>Go to the Feats tab and select the new "Class Abilities" subtab.</li>
			<li>In the lower right corner of the Class Abilities tab you see a drop down
				menu which reads "Rogue Special Abilities". Select the appropriate type of ability 
				for one of the abilities that you have noted. The "remaining" field should now show a
				positive number.</li>
			<li>In the upper left field only abilities that belong to that group will
				be displayed. Select your ability(s) for that group there.</li>
			<li>Repeat for any abilities that were taken from another group.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>MSRD Character Changes</h3>

		<p>When a pre-generated modern character is loaded, it will not recognize
			the selected Talents anymore. For that reason one or more error
			messages will be displayed at character load, which read: "Warning:
			Unable to Find Ability: xxx", where xxx is the name of a Talent that
			the character had previously selected.</p>
		<p>To fix this problem, you can take the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Write down the Talents that are mentioned in those error messages somewhere.</li>
			<li>Go to the Feats tab and select the new "Talents" subtab.</li>
			<li>In the lower right corner of the Talents tab you see a drop down
				menus which reads "Talents". Select a class that one of the talents
				you have noted was taken from. The "remaining" field should now show a
				positive number.</li>
			<li>In the upper left field only Talents that belong to that class will
				be displayed. Select your Talent(s) for that class there.</li>
			<li>Repeat for any Talents that were taken from another class.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2><a name="GMGenIssue">GMGen Known Issue</a></h2>

		<p>There is a known issue with GMGen when used on a Macintosh. In the Initiative
			Tab when running a combat when you select any character other than the one whose
			turn it is and click the Damage or Heal buttons the character whose turn it
			is becomes selected and the damage is applied to him instead of the character
			which had been selected.</p>
		<p>A solution has not yet been found but fortunately there is a simple work-around.
			The problem will only manifest when using the System Look and Feel, you can
			change the Look and Feel by going to Preferences/Appearance/Look and Feel and
			changing it to Java before activating GMGen and then it will work as it should.</p>

		<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>

		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

		<p>Java 5. PCGEN 5.13.7 is not compatible with Java
			1.4.x and it is NOT SUPPORTED. To get the latest version of Java, go to
			<a href="http://jdl.sun.com/webapps/getjava/BrowserRedirect?locale=en&amp;host=java.com">java.com</a>.</p>

		<h3>Important Warning</h3>

		<p>If you have custom data created using either the LST Editor, or the my_dataset example files, it is 
			very important that you read the <a href="#CustomDataSets">Custom Data Sets</a> section below before 
			installing your new version of PCGen.</p>

		<h3>Windows Users</h3>

		<p>We recommend that you use the Windows installer.</p>

		<h3>Mac Users</h3>

		<p>We recommend that you use the OS X DMG Mac Installer, it is now working with OS X 10.4 (Tiger).
			This has been a problem in the past due to a change on Apple&rsquo;s part in how the menu bar was
			handled with java 1.4 on Tiger, a packaged java app set to use the main window instead of
			the application window caused the program to crash at startup. At this point in time
			the solution is to set the menu bar to appear in application menu.</p>

		<p>Also new in this version is the configuration of the program, all the necessary
			files are now included with the program package. You can still access the files
			by right clicking the program and choosing <b>Show Package Contents</b>.
			See the notes included in the installer DMG for all the details.</p>

		<h3>Others (or advanced) users</h3>

		<p>Pick the package with the features you want and unzip it. It is highly
			recommended that you use a new directory for every new release. Once the
			package is unzipped, see docs\index.html for the full documentation.</p>

		<h3>Read the doc!</h3>

		<p>Please make sure you read the docs to familiarize yourself with the changes. You can access it from
			<strong>docs/index.html</strong> located in the PCGen directory.</p>

		<h2><a name="CustomDataSets">Custom Data Sets</a></h2>

		<P>PCGen provides two simple ways of adding your own data, these are the inbuilt LST 
			Editors and the starter data set <em>my_dataset</em>. Both of these need some 
			attention when upgrading PCGen.</P>

		<h3>Migrating Data Created in the LST Editor</h3>

		<p>If, as is recommended, you install PCGen into a new directory each time you upgrade, 
			you will need to copy over the data created using the LST Editors. To do this follow
			these steps.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Stop PCGen, if it is currently running. PCGen must not be 
				running when you copy the files, as PCGen writes a new copy of these files on exit.</LI>
			<li>Copy the data/customsources folder and all of its contents from your old PCGen install 
				directory to the new install directory.</LI>
			<li>Start the new version of PCGen and verify that your custom data is present.</LI>
		</ol>
		<p>If you install PCGen in the same directory as your previous install, your LST 
			editor data will still be present in the new version.</p> 

		<h3>Migrating Data Created using the my_dataset files</h3>

		<p>PCGen ships with an example set of data files ready to go to create you own data. This 
			is in the data/my_dataset folder. As the example files ship with PCGen, it is very important
			to note that these can be overwritten by a new PCGen install if you have not renamed the 
			data set and install the new version of PCGen in the same location as the old one.</p>
		<p>As a result, we strongly recommend that when using the my_dataset example files, you create a 
			copy in a new folder and work with that copy, rather than editing the example files directly.</p>
		<p>If you install PCGen into a new directory each time you upgrade, 
			you may need to copy over the data you have created. If you cannot see your custom data, simply copy 
			over the folder with your custom data to the same location in the new PCGen install. The data should 
			then be visible when you restart PCGen. </p>
		<p>If you are installing PCGen into the same directory, backup your custom data first, then make sure it 
			does not use the default my_dataset folder name. Once you are sure you data is safe, then proceed with 
			the upgrade of PCGen.</p>
