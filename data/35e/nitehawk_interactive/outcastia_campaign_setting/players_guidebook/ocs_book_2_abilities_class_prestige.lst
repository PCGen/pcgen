Any creature attempting to escape suffers attacks from half the items being juggled. All attack rolls are made with the same bonus to hit as the arcane juggler's full attack bonus. To ensnare a creature (or many creatures depending on the size of the creature), the arcane juggler must make a ranged touch attack. If the arcane juggler has an arcane juggle in effect, add a +4 magical bonus to the attack roll. If successful, the target is encircled by a 10-foot radius circle of fl ying objects.

Throwing items from a juggle is considered a standard action, but the arcane juggler is able to do it without incurring the normal -4 penalty for throwing objects that are normally not meant to be thrown, for example a pot. At higher levels the arcane juggler gains a bonus to his attack rolls when throwing items from the arcane juggle only. The bonus is as indicated in the column and it is not cumulative. Doing so does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and no strength bonuses apply to thrown items from a juggle.																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.83

Wild Empathy				KEY:Wild Empathy ~ Beast Lord		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A beast lord can improve the attitude of any animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The beast lord rolls 1d20 and adds his beast lord level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the beast lord and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A beast lord is unable to use this ability to influence magical beasts, and he loses the ability altogether when wearing armor or using a shield (see above).

# TODO: (Ex): The horok guardian develops extraordinary senses that warn him of danger before normal people are even aware of it. At 2nd level and above, he retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flatfooted or struck by an invisible attacker (he still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized, however). At 8th level, the horok guardian can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the horok guardian. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least 4 levels higher than the horok guardian can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). At 10th level, the horok guardian gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus to Reflex saves made to avoid traps.

High Psionia									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality					DESC:The mastermind learns secret lore unknown to lesser psions. He gains the ability to select a special ability from among the following by permanently eliminating power points equal to the ability to manifest a power of 5th or higher level (9 or more points). The mastermind gains a new choice of High Psionia at each level.																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.119
#
Manifestation Power	KEY:Manifestation Power ~ High Psionia	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary	DESC:This special ability increases a mastermind's effective manifester level by 1 for purposes of determining level-dependent power variables (including how many points you can spend on a power) and for manifester level checks. This ability costs you a permanent 9 power points. This ability can be selected more than once, and changes to effective manifester level are cumulative.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.120
Mastery of Elements	KEY:Mastery of Elements ~ High Psionia	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Supernatural	DESC:The mastermind can alter a psionic power when manifested so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses. For example, a mastermind could manifest a Breath of the Black Dragon that does sonic damage instead of acid damage, or Claw of Energy could be used with acid or sonic damage. This ability can only alter a power with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The power's manifesting time is unaffected. The psion decides whether to alter the power's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins manifesting. This ability costs you a permanent 11 power points.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.120
Mastery of Shaping	KEY:Mastery of Shaping ~ High Psionia	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Supernatural	DESC:The mastermind can alter area and effect powers that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the power's area or effect that are not subject to the power. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, any shapeable powers have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs you a permanent 11 power points. For example, the mastermind could manifest Dismiss Ectoplasm and leave a hole where his ally's astral construct stands, preventing it from being affected.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.120
Mastery of Speed		KEY:Mastery of Speed ~ High Psionia		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary	DESC:The mastermind can manifest a power with but a moment's thought. The manifesting time of such a power becomes 1 swift action. The mastermind can choose nearly any power he can manifest and thereafter manifest it as a swift action. He can perform another action; even manifest another power, in the same round as he manifests such a quickened power. A power whose time to manifest is more than 1 full round cannot be quickened with this ability, and powers that are already a swift or immediate action to manifest are not affected. The manifestation cost of the chosen power is unchanged. This ability costs you a permanent 17 power points and points equal to the ability to manifest the power to be permanently quickened.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.120
Mastery of Touch		KEY:Mastery of Touch ~ High Psionia		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary	DESC:The mastermind can make attacks of opportunity using any power he knows with a range of touch, if he has at least one hand free. This does not preclude the normal manifestation of a psionic power during the same round. Touch attacks of opportunity cost their normal manifestation cost. This ability costs you a permanent 15 power points. Note: This ability does not combine with Psionic Reach to give the mastermind a huge threat area (no 30 foot or 60 foot reach).																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.120
Mind Fire			KEY:Mind Fire ~ High Psionia			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Supernatural	DESC:The mastermind gains the ability to channel power points into mind fire, manifesting as a bolt of raw psionic energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level) and deals 1d6 points of damage per mastermind level plus 1d6 points of damage per power level (levels are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 for 1st thru 9th levels, respectively) of the level of the power channeled to create the effect. Therefore, a 5th level mastermind that channels a 9th level power or 17 power points into psionic fire deals 14d6 points of damage to the target if it hits (such a mastermind must be at least a 17th level manifester to do this). Furthermore, a manifester of 19th level or higher can channel up to 19 power points to get an extra 1d6 of damage with this power. This ability costs you a permanent 17 power points.	SOURCEPAGE:p.120
Psionic Reach		KEY:Psionic Reach ~ High Psionia		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary	DESC:The mastermind can use touch powers on targets up to 30 feet away. If the power requires a touch attack (melee or ranged), the mastermind must make a ranged touch attack. If selected a second time as a special ability, the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs you a permanent 13 power points. Note: In no way does this power increase the mastermind's reach for threatened area or attacks of opportunity.

He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases his hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a guard cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to his newly improved Constitution modifier. A sentinel may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the guard is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for as many rounds as his stance lasted. A sentinel can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table: Monolith Sentinel). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a sentinel can only initiate or end one during his action.
