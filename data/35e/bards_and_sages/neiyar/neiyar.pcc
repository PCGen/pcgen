DESC:An uncharted island guarded by an ancient beast. One civilization struggling against civil war. Another fighting to regain its lost glory. And a demon-god plotting to destroy them all. Welcome to Neiyar. Set on an isolated jungle island, Neiyar features five new playable races, ten prestige classes, 30 new magic items, and tons of new spells, feats, and monsters. Learn Hearth Magic and defy the laws of both arcane and divine spellcasting. Take flaws to flesh out your character and earn bonus feats. Join organizations and secret societies to gain political power.
