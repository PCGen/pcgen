# I'm not sure how to do Necromancy Domain correctly.
# I'm not sure how to do Rivers Domain correctly
#	Rivers - +8 in addition to +8 for Swim movement, or not?  Matters if character already had swim speed...

# Retribution spell "Endurance" is "Bear's Endurance in 3.5
# Stealth Spell "Improved Invisibility" is "Greater Invisibility" in 3.5
# Torment spell "Circle of Doom" is "Inflict Light Wounds, Mass" in 3.5
# Entropy spell "Random Action" is "Confusion, Lesser" in 3.5
# Time spell "Mass Haste" isn't in 3.5, no direct equivalent.
