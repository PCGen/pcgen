Tough As Old Boots										CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance,Toughness																																			PRESTAT:1,CON=15														PRETOTALAB:5						DESC:Years of living rough and getting involved in fist-fights have toughened you up to such an extent that you can laugh off punches that would fell a lesser adventurer, as well as ignoring fatigue and severe environmental conditions.
