Caver's Stealth											TYPE:Ranger			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Camouflage				PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1																																																							DESC:After many years of dungeoneering and caving, you can hide as adeptly in a long-forgotten tomb as in a forest.

Strider												TYPE:General																		PREFEAT:1,Endurance																														PRESTAT:1,CON=13																			DESC:You were born to the trail, and are well used to spending long hours and days tracking enemies' or fleeing them.
Stunning Staff											TYPE:General												PREATT:6					PREFEAT:1,Weapon Focus (Shortstaff)																												PRESTAT:1,DEX=13																			DESC:If your staff does not crack your opponent's head right open, you will at least rattle his brains enough to give you a chance to follow up your attack.
Tough As Old Boots										TYPE:General												PREATT:5					PREFEAT:2,Endurance,Toughness																													PRESTAT:1,CON=15																			DESC:Years of living rough and getting involved in fist-fights have toughened you up to such an extent that you can laugh off punches that would fell a lesser adventurer, as well as ignoring fatigue and severe environmental conditions.
Two-Weapon Bluff											TYPE:General												PREATT:9					PREFEAT:2,Two Weapon Fighting,Improved Feint																						PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1	PRESTAT:1,DEX=15																			DESC:Your lead weapon moves in subtly shifting arcs, flashing to the attack until your opponent takes his eyes away from your off-hand weapon for an instant, at which point you strike at him with it.
Two-Weapon Riposte										TYPE:General												PREATT:9					PREFEAT:2,Two Weapon Fighting,Two Weapon Defense																									PRESTAT:1,DEX=17																			DESC:You are adept at using one weapon to block an opponent's blade and with the same motion moving in to strike with your other weapon.
Two-Weapon Strike											TYPE:General												PREATT:3					PREFEAT:2,Power Attack,Two Weapon Fighting																																															DESC:Paired weapons make one of the most versatile combat combinations imaginable, and yours are more versatile still.
