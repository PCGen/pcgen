DESC:The steely-eyed assassin clutching a serrated dagger that drips with fresh venom. The grey bearded old dwarf prospector with an eye for traps and a nose for trouble. The halfling businessman, ready to sell his own daughter for the right price and willing to slip his dagger between your ribs if you turn your back on him. The high society darling, belle of the evening ball, but at the stroke of midnight this lady turns into the masked Rooftop Marauder. All these are examples of rogues, the most flexible class available in the core d20 rules. The Quintessential Rogue is a sourcebook that greatly expands the gaming horizons available to this class. Rogues have always relied on the wits and resourcefulness, and now find rules for pursuing such roguish behaviours as inventing a new poison, setting a trap to catch your enemies, or founding a criminal empire that grows to span an entire continent.
