DESC:Chaos magic is not for the faint hearted - those unwilling or unable to maintain the daring or force of will necessary to harness great, unwieldy energies will find themselves destroyed by the very power they sought. The true unfortunates will end their days locked into forms never meant for mortal eyes, let alone mortal flesh. Many are the failed practitioners of this art, and their wildly deformed bodies and warped minds serve as living testament to the dangers inherent in tampering with the basic forces of the universe. Yet there is no shortage of those willing to throw themselves into the teeth of the storm, hoping against hope they will be the one legends speak of, the master of wild forces, a true Chaos Mage. This volume of the Encyclopaedia Arcane series gives players and Games Masters alike the information they need to begin using chaos magic within their campaign. You will find chapters devoted to those who dare to tap into this primal energy, the methods used to channel primal chaos and information about the marvels and horrors of the Paths of Chaos. New feats, magic items and character types are also introduced to aid and hinder the neophyte chaos mage and his static magic counterparts.
