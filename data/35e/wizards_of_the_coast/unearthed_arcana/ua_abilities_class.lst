#Note that there are NO (unique) ranger spells in the RSRD, which means these abilities do not actually DO anything at this point....

Illusion Aptitude			KEY:Illusion Aptitude ~ Gnome Paragon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary													DESC:A gnome paragon may add his class level to his caster level to determine the effects of any illusion spells he casts, including those gained as innate abilities of the gnome race. This bonus stacks with the extra spellcasting levels gained from the gnome paragon's spells per day entry (see above). For example, a 2nd-level wizard/3rd-level gnome paragon's caster level is 2nd for most wizard spells but 5th for wizard spells of the illusion school (and 4th for his innate spell-like abilities dancing lights, ghost sound, and prestidigitation). A 3rd-level bard/2nd-level gnome paragon's caster level is 5th for most bard spells but 7th for bard spells of the illusion school. This increased caster level affects only spells that the character can cast; it does not give him access to higher-level spells or more spells per day.

# Ability Name				Unique Key										Category of Ability		Type									Description
Arcane Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Arcane Spells per Day/Spells Known	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:A swift scion may gain a number of new spells per day and spells known (if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a swift scion, the player must decide to which class to add each swift scion level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Bardic Music				KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Bardic Music					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:A swift scion may choose to gain an extra two daily uses of the bardic music ability (as described on page 29 of the Player's Handbook), provided that she already has the ability. She doesn't gain any new bardic music abilities, nor do her existing bardic music abilities improve in effectiveness.
Fast Movement				KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Fast Movement					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If a swift scion has an enhancement bonus to her speed from a class feature, she may choose to increase this enhancement bonus by 10 feet. This enhancement bonus follows the same rules as her existing enhancement bonus to speed (for instance, a monk who selects this feature only benefits from the enhancement bonus when wearing no armor).

Improved Favored Enemy			KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Improved Favored Enemy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:If a swift scion has at least one favored enemy (see page 47 of the Player's Handbook), the bonus gained on damage rolls and certain skill checks against any one favored enemy improves by +2. The character doesn't gain any additional favored enemies by selecting this ability.
Improved Unarmed Damage			KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Improved Unarmed Damage			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:If a swift scion has the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, she may choose to increase the damage dealt by her unarmed strikes. Treat this as if the character's monk level had increased by four. For instance, a 6th-level monk/2nd-level swift scion who selects this ability would increase her unarmed strike damage from 1d8 to 1d10. (If the character has no monk levels, she gains unarmed damage as a 4th-level monk.)
Improved Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If a swift scion has the uncanny dodge class feature, she may select improved uncanny dodge. Her swift scion levels stack with her levels in other classes that grant uncanny dodge to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character. (See page 26 of the Player's Handbook for details.)
Sneak Attack				KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:If a swift scion has the sneak attack ability, she may choose to increase the extra damage it deals by 2d6 points.
Swift Tracker				KEY:Swift Scion Ability ~ Swift Tracker					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SwiftScionAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If a swift scion has the Track feat, she may select this special ability. A swift scion with this ability can move at her normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

###Block: Tainted Classes

# Ability Name			Unique Key								Category of Ability		Type											Define				Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												Modify VAR								Damage Reduction		Aspects
Blood Component			KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Blood Component			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted SorcererClassFeature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A tainted sorcerer must use blood in place of any spell's material component (if the spell has no material component, ignore this cost). She has two choices for a source of blood: herself or someone else. If she uses her own blood, the minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of damage to the tainted sorcerer, but the character does not need to make a Concentration check to successfully cast the spell, despite the wound. Substituting blood for a costly material component requires drawing a greater amount of blood. A tainted sorcerer deals more damage to herself when drawing a large amount of blood, as shown on the table below. Also, when using blood to replace a costly component in this way, the tainted sorcerer must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + damage taken + spell level) to successfully cast the spell. If the tainted sorcerer draws someone else's blood to use as a material component, the rules given above generally apply. If the source of blood is willing (or helpless) and is adjacent to the tainted sorcerer, she can make a minor knife cut to obtain a small amount of blood as a free action during the casting of the spell. (If the source is not willing or helpless and not adjacent, how long it takes to draw blood depends entirely on the circumstances.) No single source of blood can be used to replace a costly material component unless the character or creature's current hit point total is high enough to absorb all the damage without falling below -10. For example, the blood of an orc with 6 hit points remaining is not sufficient to replace a component that costs 301 gp or more, because the orc cannot take the necessary 17 points of damage before it is dead.
Taint Suppression			KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Taint Suppression			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted SorcererClassFeature.SpecialQuality								DESC:While a tainted sorcerer is likely to accumulate a high taint score over the course of her life, this taint is not immediately obvious to onlookers. A tainted sorcerer's taint manifests in mental effects-insanity, rage, and nightmares-and in internal physical effects. If a tainted sorcerer is split open, the character's internal corruption is obvious: Her body is full of bloody pus and strange growths, even internal limbs. If a tainted sorcerer enters a tainted area, her corruption immediately manifests externally as well. Barring these two conditions, it is impossible to detect a tainted sorcerer based on appearance. A tainted sorcerer no longer applies her taint score as a penalty to her Constitution, and only applies one-half her taint score as a penalty to her Wisdom.
Tainted Metamagic			KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Tainted Metamagic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted SorcererClassFeature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A tainted sorcerer who learns metamagic feats can apply them by paying an additional cost in blood. By draining blood, a tainted sorcerer can enhance her spells without using a higher-level spell slot. The cost is a number of points of Constitution damage equal to the spell slot adjustment of the metamagic feat. Thus, casting an empowered vampiric touch spell costs a tainted sorcerer 2 points of Constitution damage, because an empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than normal. A tainted sorcerer cannot enhance a spell to a level higher than she can cast by this means. For example, a tainted sorcerer must be at least a 9th-level caster to cast an empowered vampiric touch spell (or at least 10th level, if the character is casting as a sorcerer), since the empowered spell requires a 5th-level spell slot. A tainted sorcerer without a Constitution score cannot use this ability.
Tainted Spellcasting		KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Tainted Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted SorcererClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:Rather than using a key ability score for spellcasting, a tainted sorcerer uses her taint score. To cast a spell, a tainted sorcerer must have a taint score at least equal to the spell's level. Tainted sorcerer bonus spells are based on a number equal to the character's taint score + 10, and saving throws against tainted sorcerer spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the tainted sorcerer's taint score. A tainted sorcerer accumulates taint for casting her spells. All spells a tainted sorcerer casts are evil spells. She must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level) or increase her taint score by 1.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted SorcererClassFeature.SpecialQuality								DESC:Tainted sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a tainted sorcerer's arcane gestures, which can cause her spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components).
Spells per Day/ Spells Known	KEY:Tainted Sorcerer ~ Spells per Day/ Spells Known	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted SorcererClassFeature.SpecialQuality								DESC:When a new tainted sorcerer level is gained, the character gains new spells known and spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of tainted sorcerer to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she has, then determines spells known, spells per day, and caster level accordingly

# Tainted Warrior
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Tainted Warrior ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted WarriorClassFeature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Tainted warriors do not gain any additional weapon or armor proficiencies.
Taint Suppression			KEY:Tainted Warrior ~ Taint Suppression			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted WarriorClassFeature.SpecialQuality									DESC:By definition, a tainted warrior is overwhelmed with taint, but this taint is not immediately obvious to onlookers. A tainted sorcerer's taint manifests in mental effects-delirium, anger, and cruelty-and in internal physical effects. If a tainted warrior is split open, the internal corruption is obvious: His body is full of vile liquids and distorted growths, even internal limbs. If a tainted warrior enters a tainted area, his corruption immediately manifests externally as well. Barring these two conditions, it is impossible to detect a tainted warrior based on appearance. A tainted warrior no longer applies his taint score as a penalty to his Constitution, and only applies one-half his taint score as a penalty to his Wisdom.
Damage Reduction			KEY:Tainted Warrior ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted WarriorClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:TaintedWarriorDR|0	DESC:At 2nd level, a tainted warrior gains damage reduction 1/good.

The character adds his taint score to the damage dealt by the melee attack, and the target's taint score increases by 1. If a tainted warrior strikes a creature immune to the effects of taint (such as an undead creature or a creature with the evil subtype), the tainted strike has no effect. A tainted warrior can use this ability once per day upon attaining 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four levels gained thereafter.
