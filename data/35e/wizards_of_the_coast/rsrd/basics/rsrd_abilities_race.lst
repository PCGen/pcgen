Low-Light Vision	KEY:Low-Light Vision	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:LowLightDistance|0	DESC:You can see %1x as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.|LowLightDistance																																																																																																																																																																																		BONUS:VAR|LowLightDistance|2|TYPE=Base	VISION:Low-Light (LowlightRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Low-Light
Darkvision		KEY:Darkvision		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:DarkvisionRange|0	DESC:Range %1;|DarkvisionRange|PREVARGTEQ:DarkvisionRange,1	DESC:Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.|DarkvisionRange																																																																																																																																																																												VISION:Darkvision (DarkvisionRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Darkvision %1'|DarkvisionRange
Blindsense		KEY:Blindsense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:BlindsenseRange|0	DESC:Range %1;|BlindsenseRange|PREVARGTEQ:BlindsenseRange,1	DESC:The creature has blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total concealment (50%% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.|BlindsenseRange																																																																																																																												VISION:Blindsense (BlindsenseRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Blindsense %1'|BlindsenseRange
Blindsight		KEY:Blindsight		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:BlindsightRange|0	DESC:Range %1;|BlindsightRange|PREVARGTEQ:BlindsightRange,1	DESC:The creature has blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination of such senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can't see ethereal creatures and must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature description. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature's description. If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.&nl;Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight.&nl;Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).&nl;Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight.&nl;Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.&nl;Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.&nl;Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.|BlindsightRange								VISION:Blindsight (BlindsightRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Blindsight %1'|BlindsightRange
Tremorsense		KEY:Tremorsense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:TremorsenseRange|0	DESC:Range %1;|TremorsenseRange|PREVARGTEQ:TremorsenseRange,1	DESC:A creature with tremorsense automatically senses the location of anything that is in contact with the ground and within range. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it's sensing, then the range defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground, and the creatures must be moving. As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting spells with somatic components, they're considered moving; they don't have to move from place to place for a creature with tremorsense to detect them.|TremorsenseRange																																																																																																																																					VISION:Tremorsense (TremorsenseRange)		ASPECT:Vision|Tremorsense %1'|TremorsenseRange

#Augmented Subtype: A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type.
#The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature's original type.
#For example, a wizard's raven familiar is a magical beast (augmented animal).
#A creature with the augmented subtype usually has the _traits_ of its current type, but the _features_ of its original type.
#For example, a wizard's raven familiar has an animal's features and the traits of a magical beast.

Natural Weapons			KEY:Chaos Beast ~ Natural Weapons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chaos BeastRaceTrait.SpecialQuality				VISIBLE:YES																DESC:A chaos beast's claw attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Corporeal Instability		KEY:Chaos Beast ~ Corporeal Instability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chaos BeastRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																DESC:A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is Constitution-based. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried-armor, backpacks, even shirts-hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50%% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast. A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful. Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove. A shapechange or stoneskin spell does not cure an afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes the affliction (a separate restoration is necessary to restore any drained points of Wisdom).
Immunity to Transformation	KEY:Chaos Beast ~ Immunity to Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chaos BeastRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES																DESC:No mortal magic can permanently affect or fix a chaos beast's form.

The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. The elemental's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature's space.

An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's size (see the table). The save DC is Strength based.

This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

Web					KEY:Ettercap ~ Web					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EttercapRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES				DESC:An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day.

In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. A djinni's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the djinni enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the djinni moves into or through the creature's space. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A creature with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racial adjustment. Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the djinni carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The djinni can have only as many trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume. The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be.  If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and does not threaten the area around it.

Light Ray					KEY:Ghaele ~ Light Ray						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhaeleRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.
Alternate Form				KEY:Ghaele ~ Alternate Form					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhaeleRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form. A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any particular form when killed. A true seeing spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.
Protective Aura				KEY:Ghaele ~ Protective Aura					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GhaeleRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele.

Race Traits ~ Ghost Template											CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=Ghost TemplateRaceTrait
# ~ Ghost Template
Corrupting Gaze				KEY:Ghost Template ~ Corrupting Gaze			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost's gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.
Corrupting Touch				KEY:Ghost Template ~ Corrupting Touch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.
Draining Touch				KEY:Ghost Template ~ Draining Touch				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.
Frightful Moan				KEY:Ghost Template ~ Frightful Moan				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours.
Horrific Appearance			KEY:Ghost Template ~ Horrific Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:Any living creature within 60 feet that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost's horrific appearance for 24 hours.
Malevolence					KEY:Ghost Template ~ Malevolence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost's Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body.
Manifestation				KEY:Ghost Template ~ Manifestation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50%% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane. When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost's touch spells don't work on nonethereal targets. A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.
Telekinesis					KEY:Ghost Template ~ Telekinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher). When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again.
Special Qualities				KEY:Ghost Template ~ Special Qualities			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality				VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below.
Rejuvenation				KEY:Ghost Template ~ Rejuvenation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ghost TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's HD) against DC 16.

The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19 Charisma check.

Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large (although four swarms working together can  inhabit a Huge creature). The swarm can abandon the body at any time, although doing this takes 1 full round. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's resistances and immunities may negate some or all of this damage. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can restore animation to the creature and control its movements, effectively transforming it into a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the swarm remains inside. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster on the victim. The hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour they inhabit a body. A body reduced to Constitution 0 is dead. A hellwasp-inhabited creature is relatively easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of insects inside. The swarm is intelligent enough to attempt to hide beneath loose clothing or a large cloak to keep its presence from being detected. The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host. A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.

Regeneration				KEY:Tarrasque ~ Regeneration					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TarrasqueRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:No form of attack deals lethal damage to the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a disintegrate spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hp). The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem's cursed wound ability.

Dominate					KEY:Vampire Template ~ Dominate				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A vampire can crush an opponent's will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.
Create Spawn				KEY:Vampire Template ~ Create Spawn				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire's energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn entry) 1d4 days after burial.  If the vampire instead drains the victim's Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. At any given time a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.
Energy Drain				KEY:Vampire Template ~ Energy Drain				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:Living creatures hit by a vampire's slam attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels.

Alternate Form				KEY:Vampire Template ~ Alternate Form			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to a polymorph spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the vampire does not regain hit points for changing form and must choose from among the forms mentioned here. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms.)
Damage Reduction				KEY:Vampire Template ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Fast Healing				KEY:Vampire Template ~ Fast Healing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.
Gaseous Form				KEY:Vampire Template ~ Gaseous Form				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

Vampire Weaknesses			KEY:Vampire Template ~ Vampire Weaknesses			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vampire TemplateRaceTrait.SpecialQuality				VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.	DESC:&nl; Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don't harm the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.	DESC:&nl; Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship.	DESC:&nl; They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.	DESC:&nl; Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see the note on fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a single move action or attack action and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire's heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic is to cut off the creature's head and fill its mouth with holy wafers (or their equivalent).

Shriek					KEY:Vargouille ~ Shriek						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VargouilleRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth and let out a terrible shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with fear for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A paralyzed creature is susceptible to the vargouille's kiss (see below). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille's shriek for 24 hours. The shriek is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
Kiss						KEY:Vargouille ~ Kiss						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VargouilleRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES																																DESC:A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a successful melee touch attack. An affected opponent must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that turns the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim's hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and even a daylight spell can delay death, but to reverse the transformation requires remove disease.
