The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. [Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.] If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine [spell-like abilities register as arcane], and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic [such as the secret page and illusory script spells].

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim [even weaker than a faint aura]. How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: &nl;Original Strength &pipe;Duration of Lingering Aura &nl;Faint &pipe;1d6 rounds &nl;Moderate &pipe;1d6 minutes &nl;Strong &pipe;1d6x10 minutes &nl;Overwhelming &pipe;1d6 days &nl;Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. &nl;Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area.

Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page [250 words] per minute.

A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check [using its increased Strength] to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it- the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession [including a projectile or thrown weapon] instantly returns to its normal size.
