Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Psion ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DESC:Psions are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, quarterstaff, and shortspear. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor does not, however, interfere with the manifestation of powers.																																																																																																																																																																																									AUTO:WEAPONPROF|Club|Dagger|Crossbow (Heavy)|Crossbow (Light)|Quarterstaff|Shortspear|Spells (Ray)	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=WeaponProfAuto
Power Points/Day			KEY:Psion ~ Power Points/Day			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DESC:A psion's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psion. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.
Discipline				KEY:Psion ~ Discipline				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DESC:Every psion must decide at 1st level which psionic discipline he will specialize in. Choosing a discipline provides a psion with access to the class skills associated with that discipline (see above), as well as the powers restricted to that discipline. However, choosing a discipline also means that the psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can't even use such powers by employing psionic items.
Powers Known			KEY:Psion ~ Powers Known			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DESC:A psion begins play knowing three psion powers of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new powers. Choose the powers known from the psion power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen discipline. You cannot choose powers from disciplines other than your chosen discipline. (Exception: The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a psion to learn powers from the lists of other disciplines or even other classes.) A psion can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level. The number of times a psion can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily power points.  A psion simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psion powers is 10 + the power's level + the psion's Intelligence modifier. Maximum Power Level Known: A psion begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, a psion may gain the ability to master more complex powers. To learn or manifest a power, a psion must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level.
Bonus Feats				KEY:Psion ~ Bonus Feats				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PsionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DESC:A psion gains a bonus feat at 1st level, 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels. A psion is not limited to psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats when choosing these other feats.

###Block: Psionic Companion Modifier Abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type								Visible	Description																																																																																																																									Bonus to skill
Channel Power		KEY:Psicrystal ~ Channel Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike				VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner can manifest powers through the psicrystal to a distance of up to 1 mile. The psicrystal is treated as the power's originator, and all ranges are calculated from its location. When channeling a power through his psicrystal, the owner manifests the power by paying its power point cost. He is still subject to attacks of opportunity and other hazards of manifesting a power, if applicable (for instance, he becomes visible when manifesting an offensive power if invisible, as does the psicrystal).
Deliver Touch Powers	KEY:Psicrystal ~ Deliver Touch Powers	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner can have his psicrystal can deliver touch powers for him. If the owner and psicrystal are in contact at the time the owner manifests a touch power, he can designate his psicrystal as the "toucher." The psicrystal can then deliver the touch power just as the owner could. As usual, if the owner manifests another power before the touch is delivered, the touch power dissipates.
Hardness 8			KEY:Psicrystal ~ Hardness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality					VISIBLE:YES
Power Resistance		KEY:Psicrystal ~ Power Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The psicrystal gains power resistance equal to the owner's level + 5. To affect the psicrystal with a power, another manifester must get a result on a manifester level check that equals or exceeds the psicrystal's power resistance.
Self-Propulsion		KEY:Psicrystal ~ Self-Propulsion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, its owner can will a psicrystal to form spidery, ectoplasmic legs that grant the psicrystal a land speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 20 feet. The legs fade into nothingness after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
Flight			KEY:Psicrystal ~ Flight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner can, as a standard action, will his psicrystal to fly at a speed of 50 feet (poor). The psicrystal drifts gently to the ground after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
Share Powers		KEY:Psicrystal ~ Share Powers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At the owner's option, he can have any power (but not any psi-like ability) he manifests on himself also affect his psicrystal. The psicrystal must be within 5 feet of him at the time of the manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the psicrystal if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and will not affect the psicrystal again, even if it returns to its owner before the duration expires. Additionally, the owner can manifest a power with a target of "You" on his psicrystal (as a touch range power) instead of on himself. The owner and psicrystal cannot share powers if the powers normally do not affect creatures of the psicrystal's type (construct).
Sight Link			KEY:Psicrystal ~ Sight Link			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike				VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The character can remote view the psicrystal (as if manifesting the remote view power) once per day.
Telepathic Link		KEY:Psicrystal ~ Telepathic Link		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner has a telepathic link with his psicrystal out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The owner cannot see through the psicrystal's senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as if the psicrystal were the target of a mindlink power manifested by the owner. For instance, a psicrystal placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room. Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too.
Telepathic Speech		KEY:Psicrystal ~ Telepathic Speech		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The psicrystal can communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language and is within 30 feet of the psicrystal, while the psicrystal is also within 1 mile of the owner.
Improved Evasion		KEY:Psicrystal ~ Improved Evasion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:If a psicrystal is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.
Alertness			KEY:Psicrystal ~ Alertness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:The presence of a psicrystal sharpens its master's senses. While a psicrystal is within arm's reach (adjacent to or in the same square as its owner), its owner gains the Alertness feat.
Personality			KEY:Psicrystal ~ Personality			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:Every psicrystal has a personality. See Psicrystal Personality, below.

# Psicrystal
Sighted			KEY:Psicrystal ~ Sighted			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Although it has no physical sensory organs, a psicrystal can telepathically sense its environment as well as a creature with normal vision and hearing. Darkness (even supernatural darkness) is irrelevant, as are areas of supernatural silence, though a psicrystal still can't discern invisible or ethereal beings. A psicrystal's sighted range is 40 feet.
Skills			KEY:Psicrystal ~ Skills				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality							DESC:A psicrystal has the same skill ranks as its owner, except that it has a minimum of 4 ranks each in Spot, Listen, Move Silently, and Search. (Even if its owner has no ranks in these skills, a psicrystal has 4 ranks in each.) A psicrystal uses its own ability modifiers on skill checks.

A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).

CATEGORY=Special Ability|MindBlade Psychic Strike.MOD																																														DESC:As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mind-affecting effects.) A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action. Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.
