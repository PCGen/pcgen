load with Core Rules for the 3.5 revised edition. 

Racial progression is at this point NOT automatic, add appropriate template for each level.
(When code freq has come through it will fire choices automagically and I can throw away all the 210 templates)

Talent/Transformation Skills:
They are a major headache but they work. Pick this and you have to go through 2*5 choosers.
Two choosers for each +1 on a skill.
This setup is in part to ensure the max +3 limit. 


To progress in a legendary path choose the template "Legendary Path 1st Circle",..
This will give you choices of the paths that you are qualified for.
Note that the Legend Points prereq is not implemented.
