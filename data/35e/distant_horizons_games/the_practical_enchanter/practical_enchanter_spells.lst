#Original Entry: Andrew Maitland

#COMMENT: Due to the CLASSES:ALL= factor, need to enable or disable taking these spells, as GM's might only want Wizards but not Clerics and Paladins gaining spells.
#		Implemented the Bypass by a simple Template; again, open to any other solution.
#COMMENT: Some of these are Regular Spells, and some are "template" spells, where the caster builds a variant from the template.
#		This source does not define individual classes, they are simply Level=x. It is up to the GM to allow or disallow spells
#		Only improvement that can be added here is adding temp bonuses.

#This spell, like the Paramount and Epic versions, is generic, flexible, and somewhat less flavorful than the Eldritch Armor spells in 3.0 d20. It becomes far less flexible in 3.5 d20, where fewer armor functions are rated in "pluses". Still, if you want simplicity, or to get sorcerers and bards to take armor-enhancing spells, this works nicely. On the downside, enchantment is simpler and there's an annoying tendency to for characters to match defenses to their opponents on the fly.

Clean Clothing						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:one large basket of clothing or the equivalent									DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Clean Clothing cleans, presses [if necessary], folds [if desired], and makes minor repairs on one large basket of clothing or some equivalent - a tarp or sail, a tent, or an object or objects of similar volume. Despite the name, leather goods, furs, and jewelry are treated similarly. It will work on clothing that's currently being worn, and is a good way to keep looking sharp - avoiding any penalties for being a mess.
Dry								CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature or item of up so size large or up to thirty pounds of unliving organic material	DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Dry removes water from the surface of living creatures or inorganic objects or can effectively dehydrate up to thirty pounds of meat, herbs, or similar materials without subjecting them to damaging heat or processing. This can be quite important when gathering medicinal herbs or magical components, ofering a +5 circumstance bonus on any rolls made using them.
Umbrella							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Creatures and objects in a five-foot radius burst								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL+3) hours (D).						SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Umbrella makes the creatures and items affected weakly water-repellant - enough to remain dry in a downpour or in a pond, to keep water from leaking into their boots, and to push back fog several feet. If the user is attacked by water or acid-based attacks during the duration, the spell will absorb three points of the damage before dissipating. Of course, it also keeps bowstring, scrolls, and bandages dry - which may sometimes be of vital necessity.
Air Mattress						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Conjuration	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:up to thirty-six square feet												DURATION:12 Hours (D).								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Air Mattress thickens and binds the air to a depth of about four inches - creating a dry, well-insulated, and extremely comfortable mattress. This is easy to sleep on, offers a +1 bonus to recovery checks made against diseases and to any checks related to sleeping well, and - if placed under a falling individual - will convert one die of falling damage to stun damage.
Create Element						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Conjuration	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:up to ten pounds or one gallon (whichever is less) of material per level					DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:No																														SPELLRES:No						PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Create Element generates a loose mass of basic elemental material - air, water, earth [whether dirt, sand, or crumbled clay], or even fire. The element can either be created in a lump, or scattered over an area up to three feet across. Unfortunately for the aggressively-minded, even several "gallons of flame" is just a wash of hot gas; it will burn painfully - but such burns are superficial at best, amounting to a mere 2d4 points of damage.
Blanket							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Conjuration	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:up to a 100 square feet													DURATION:12 Hours.								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Blanket inhibits heat transfer, whether in or out of the area it's applied to. It will keep you warm on a cold night - or it can be cast around hot food to keep it that way, spread over an area of hot coals to allow a quick passage, wrapped around a fragile creature or object that you need to carry out of a burning building, or used to keep a small tree or garden plot from getting nipped by a late frost. If it's used in situations of serious danger - such as to try and keep a the hut you're hiding in from catching when a brushfire sweeps thorough - it reduces the first die of heat or cold damage to stun damage [which won't affect inanimate objects of course].
Check Edibility						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Divination		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:up to two bushels of organic material										DURATION:ten minutes.								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Check Edibility reveals the presence of natural - albeit not artificial - poisons and dangerous bioactive compounds or organisms in plants, fungi, cultures, and meats. Using it will easily reveal the poisonous wild mushrooms mixed in with the edible ones, the stomach-cramp inducing leaves in the herbs, and the hallucinogenic ergot in the bread. It's important to note, however, that the spell checks against the metabolism of the caster; if he or she suffers from peanut allergies, the spell will reveal peanuts as being poisonous. On the other hand, if the caster happens to be immune to a particular toxin, it's presence will pass unchallenged. Of course, if a character happens to be searching for poisons or drugs, this spell makes it easy to locate them as well. Sadly, in either case, it does not check for flavor.
Check Health						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Divination		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One Creature															DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Check Health provides a quick evaluation of the state of health of the target creature and what, if anything, is the cause of any current difficulties. In conjunction with appropriate skills - medical, chemical, anatomic, alchemical, or biological, it provides an immediate skill check with a +5 bonus to provide a precise diagnosis ["It's ku poison! that's very rare. We'll have to scramble to find the antidote if we want to save him; it's resistant to magical cures"]. This can be quite handy when the illness itself is a clue - such as the rare poison mentioned above, or if a particular disease can only be caught in particular locations, or from demons, or some such.
Tally Up							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Divination		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:20' radius or special													DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Tally Up simply provides an instant count of, measurement of, or weighing up of, items within it's area of effect - although it becomes increasingly unreliable as those items get smaller and more numrous. It does an excellent job on counting coins ["14 Gold, 112 Silver, 67 Copper"], books, and similar items, but asking it to count - say - grains of sand usually just results in "lots" - or the total mass or volume of the sand in question.	DESC:Tally Up can also be used in conjunction with a quick glance at larger objects and groups - but, in that case, is only accurate to the first digit. A scout could glance at a horde of orcs, and announce that there were "about 20,000", but the actual number visible might be anything from 19,501 to 20,500 - and the spell cannot help him or her count any orcs that are not within line-of-sight at the moment. Similarly, a peak might be estimated as "about 8000 feet" or the mass of a pyramid at "about six million tons".
Call Domestic Animal					CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Enchantment	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Special	TARGETAREA:One domesticated animal													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours (D).						SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Call Domestic Animal gives one personal domesticated pet within ten miles, or one known and named domesticated animal within five miles, or any single domesticated animal within long range (known or not), a strong urge to come to the caster. A save is not allowed unless the caster either means to harm the animal or the animal has good reason to resist - such as if the route is dangerous. This does not necessarily mean that the animal will come however; it will simply feel a strong urge to do so; if it's busy defending it's offspring or some such, it is likely to ignore the call. Of course, if you need to catch a carrier pigeon, or a runaway horse [perhaps one with an unconscious rider], or find the cat with a clue on it's collar, than this is the spell for you.
Magnification						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Enchantment	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:one creature															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes.						SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Magnification can be applied to any one sense, either to allow the user to examine the very small at very close range, or to allow the user to examine things further away as if they were nearer. Regardless of which application is selected, the spell provides x10 magnification - albeit with all the usual problems of a narrow field of view and the jerkiness of small movements being magnified. Where relevant, and the effect isn't obvious, a +5 circumstance bonus is in order.	DESC:While nowhere near as powerful as effects like scrying, magnification has plenty of uses - especially when attempting to gather information - something which should be a vital concern to most low-level parties.
Soothe Infant						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Enchantment	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:up to six babies within range												DURATION:12 hours/the number of babies affected.			SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Soothe Infant keeps babies dry, clean, and happy for the duration, and will even let them put off eating until after the charm wears off with no harm. Admittedly, this isn't usually something that spellcasters usually worry much about - but when you're on a stealthy rescue mission, covering the retreat of the noncombatants, or need to hide from pursuers, there are few things more conspicuous than the cries [and smell] of an unhappy infant. In such cases, Soothe Infant may be far more useful than another Fireball.
Gauntlets							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Evocation		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One Creature															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes						SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:The Gauntlets spell creates a protective aura around the user's hands, providing protection equivalent to heavy, tough, work gloves or oven mitts [DR 3/- for the user's hands only; the user does not make actual contact with anything he or she touches] with no loss of sensitivity, control, or fine manipulation. This makes it easy to handle hot objects, renders the user immune to contact poisons [and many "poison needle traps" and such], allows him or her to safely handle small vipers, protects against chemical spills, keeps the user's hands comfortably warm in cold weather, and otherwise renders safe and easy many otherwise hazardous tasks. Where this is helpful, the user may reduce the time required for such activities by 25%%.
Unplug Drains						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Evocation		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Special															DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Unplug Drains does just that, sending a rotating telekinetic force with a strength equal to one-half the user's intelligence speeding through a length of pipe. Pipes larger than six inches in diameter, longer than a hundred feet, or extremely solidly plugged, may require repeated applications. Adventurers, of course, are noted for using it in unintended ways - to spray tubes full of oil or greek fire upon enemies, to clear fouled guns and cannon, and even [in a few cases] as an attack on the digestive system [personally I don't let this work, but your tastes may differ].
Painkiller							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Illusion		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One Creature															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours							SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Painkiller is pretty simple; while the spell endures, it can be applied to an injury or to an area of the body, and - while the target may feel a bit of discomfort or pressure - the sensations of pain in that area will be reduced as much as the caster desired. This is good for soothing children, relieving the pain of the dying to allow them to speak clearly, counteracting stiffness, soreness, and limps, resisting torture, and backstabbing people without letting them notice it. Unfortunately, pain is an important warning; it is unwise to simply turn it off for long, or to do so in order to engage in activities that it was warning you against; an unwise user can easily further injure himself or herself.
Pantomime							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Illusion		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One Creature															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds							SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Pantomime allows the user to get basic messages across a language barrier - clearly conveying things like "I am hungry, I want to buy some food", "Where's the bathroom", and similar simple messages with a few gestures. The recipients of such messages gain no special power to reply, but will realize that they can reply with a few similar simple gestures - and perhaps a few sounds - quite readily.
The Good Cook						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Illusion		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Up to a full meal for twelve												DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:The Good Cook greatly improves the flavor of a meal - although, alas, not it's fundamental quality, the nourishment that it contains, or it's digestibility, providing a +15 bonus on any Cooking check made to determine the flavor - and neatly covering up any problems resulting from a shortage of good-quality ingredients, the introduction of poisons or drugs, or similar difficulties.
Butcher							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One dead body														DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Butcher allows a body - ranging from that of a squirrel up to that of a rhinoceros (a whale or dinosaur may take several castings) to be cut up, deboned, and reduced to chops, slices, sausages, and assorted meat by-products in short order - in fact, in only one-quarter of the usual time, with very little mess, and with a simple knife. While this is useful to hunters, butchers, and similar individuals - who will be able to produce the freshest, tastiest, cuts with little effort [and without spending a lot of time surrounded by meat and covered in insect and predator-attracting blood] - adventurers occasionally use it to dispose of inconvenient corpses as well.
Contraception						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One Creature															DURATION:One Day/one breeding cycle.					SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Contraception is quite simple; for the next twenty-four hours [if male] or the next breeding cycle [if female], the target will be unable to sire or bear offspring. Other sexual functions are not affected; only fertility is impaired. A popular recreational spell.
Transfuse							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One donor creature and one recipient creature									DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Transfuse allows a willing living donor to transfer some of his, her, or it's hit points to a living recipient - up to a limit of ten hit points or one-half of the donors current hit points, whichever is less. While this will not stop bleeding, it can restore lost hit points or even raise the targets hit points up to six points above his or her normal maximum - although any points above the recipients normal limits will fade away in twenty-four hours.	DESC:Transfuse isn't really healing, and doesn't add to a groups net hit points - but it can be quite useful in keeping someone alive or in waking up the injured healer so he or she can do something that actually restores lost hit points.
Cure Hide							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One animal carcass														DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Cure Hide turns the hide of an already-deceased animal into leather or a cured pelt. Since this involves stripping away the underlayer of the skin, and thus breaking the connective tissues which hold the skin on, it also means that such a hide can be easily and quickly removed from the animal's body, with little risk of damage. While additional, skilled, work will be required to convert such a pelt into truly fine leather or fur, it will be quite usable for basic purposes - or salable - as-is. In fact, the lack of holes, even preservation, and reduced decay mean that hides or pelts prepared with the aid of this spell are worth an average of 25%% more than those prepared manually. Of course, if you're caught out in the cold and attacked by some wild animal, it can be very handy to be able to turn its hide into a warm and comfortable robe with a quick spell and a few minutes work.
Extract (Butter)						CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:up to two gallons per level of unliving organic material							DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Extract is most widely known for it's use in extracting butter or cream from milk, but it can also be used to extract nectar or perfume essences from flowers, oil from nuts, naphtha from crude oil, dyes from insect shells, and flavoring extracts from plants, among other uses - although the user is advised to have a suitable container handy to hold whatever he or she is extracting. In the hands of adventurer's, Extract is most commonly used to collect special resources - whether for sale, for some esoteric use, or simply [like a vial of skunk oil] to trouble opponents.
Mill								CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One large bag or basket of unliving grindable material								DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Mill reduces material to grains or powder at the option of the caster, turning grain to flour or meal, pumice to scrubbing powder, coal to dust, and bone to bone meal. While this is an immense timesaver in many household and industrial tasks, adventurers tend to be interested in things like scattering dust to reveal invisible creatures, creating fuel-air explosions [flour or coal works very nicely], and disposing of inconvenient bones [easily done, once you have them gathered up].
Sharpen							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to a dozen tools or weapons												DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Sharpen puts a fine edge on tools and weapons, saving a good deal of time with a sharpening stone or strop. Where this is relevant - such as for chefs, butchers, barners, woodcutters, and so on - possessing this spell is worth a +3 bonus on skill checks made to see how much money you make and to avoid accidents. While normal wear and tear - such as being sheathed and unsheathed - will swiftly reduce such a honed edge to normal sharpness, for the first few moments, a Sharpened edge is preternaturally keen. Piercing and cutting weapons so treated gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage on their first hit against an opponent during the round in which they were sharpened.
Mnemonic							CLASSES:ALL=0	SCHOOL:Universal		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched														DURATION:Three Minutes/Special.						SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Mnemonic allows the target to briefly study a scene or document, listen to a speech or directions, or otherwise pay close attention to his or her sensory impressions during it's three-minute duration, and then recall them in exacting detail for up to a week afterwards. Even after the immediate impression fades, the user will enjoy a +5 bonus on any rolls needed to recall details afterwards. While this is useful to any student, adventurers tend to use it to memorize secret documents, listen to battle plans, recall routes through labyrinths, and for similar daring undertakings.


#Block: Level 1
#Alarm
#Unseen Servant
Deodorize (House)						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:30' radius cloud														DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Deodorize removes, or - at the option of the caster - replaces scents. While scents will gradually return unless their sources are dealt with or removed, this has many applications in cleaning and comfort. While the spell is not powerful enough to be especially useful as an attack - it is not capable of inducing nausea or similar problems as a Stinking Cloud can - it can certainly irritate, distract, and even partially "blind" creatures which depend on scent. Of course, adventurers tend to find applications in evading bloodhounds, neutralizing Stinking Cloud spells [which it will do], removing the scents of skunks, frightening off wolves by making the campsite smell like it's a den full of tigers, and similar tricks.
Remove (Lice)						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:10' Radius															DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Fortitude, for half																											SPELLRES:Yes.					PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Remove Lice instantly destroys a variety of small pests, parasites, and skin problems, including lice, fleas, fungal infections, green slime, vrock and yellow mold spores, and swarms of insects, normally inflicting 4d4 damage on each creature to be affected. Considering that most such creatures have one hit point at best, this is usually quite sufficient. Adventurers tend to find his marvelously handy when dealing with a few specific types of creature and fairly useless otherwise - unless, of course, they're in a plague-stricken area, in which case using this spell regularly can be a lifesaver.
Scarecrow							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Conjuration	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Special															DURATION:twenty-four hours.							SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Scarecrow is basically a specialized variant of Unseen Servant; unlike the basic spell, it can be left unattended, and will continue to perform it's particular task - chasing pests out of a field - for a full day. Like an Unseen Servant, it can only "take 10" on tasks. Related variants perform other specific tasks - harvesting fruit, hauling water to irrigate plants, tending a boiler or a blacksmith's fire, or cleaning floors. While each such variant is a specific spell, they're so much alike that anyone who leans one variant can be presumed to have also mastered four others.
Tarp								CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Conjuration	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Special															DURATION:Twelve Hours								SAVEINFO:Reflex Evades																												SPELLRES:Yes.					PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Tarp produces up to four hundred square feet of durable, watertight, canvas - either simply draping it across an area or stretching it over any suitable supporting framework. It can replace a small sail, keep the rain off a pile of equipment or other stockpile, erect a serviceable tent, briefly block a cloud of toxic gas, or help break a fall. It can also be dropped over an opponent or small group thereof, although those who succeed in a reflex save will generally simply duck out from underneath [and those will spell resistance are likely to rip right through]. Anyone entangled in a tarp must spend a move action to get free; until then, they will suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on their actions and will be unable to see.
Dowsing							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Divination		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Special	TARGETAREA:Self																DURATION:5d6 minutes to obtain results.					SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Dowsing has two basic effects; it provides a +5 bonus on an attempt to find something and allows the search to be conducted without actually going and making it. Thus, when looking for water [survival] instead of carefully inspecting the ground and digging small holes looking for traces of moisture, one can wander around with a stick. When searching for a hidden cave entrance, one can sit at home and swing a pendulum over a map instead of crawling about in the hills. You can use dowsing - whether with a stick or a pedatum - to search for oil, for internal infections and injuries, to look for water, game, fish, gems, tombs, roads, lost children, mystical nexi or ley lines, and many other items. Unfortunately, remote searches provide only general locations at best - and it can be rather difficult to tell when you're wrong; the GM should roll in secret for remote searches. Thus using a pendulum and a map may help you find the general location of that ancient crypt, but to locate the door precisely, you'll have to go to that area and do some more searching.
Animal Influence						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Enchantment	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature with Int 2 or less											DURATION:Up to one hour								SAVEINFO:Will Negates	SAVEINFO:None if the user has some food appropriate to the creature being targeted and is willing to give it to it [if, perhaps, later], otherwise Will negates.	SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Animal Influence is similar to Suggestion, but only works on non-sapient creatures - and only if the user means no harm to the creature targeted. The user may easily calm a panicky mount, get a bird to carry a small item a few blocks, befriend and pet a creature, or get a rat to drag the key to the cell over within reach. Of course, creatures with such low intelligence are unlikely to manage anything too complicated, and the creatures affected won't take major risks or go to enormous efforts to assist - but they do make excellent distractions and can run many small errands.
Sheer (Sheep)						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Evocation		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Special															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*20) minutes						SAVEINFO:None.																													SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Sheer cuts hair (and, optionally, styles the remainder) with a casual pass of the user's hand and without hurting the creature being shorn. For classical sheep-shearing, this can reduce the time required to a minute or two, larger animals [and struggling children] will require more time. If the user wishes to produce fancy haircuts, beard styling, and similar results, he or she will need to make a skill check to do so.
Snapshot							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Illusion		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Item touched															DURATION:Permanent.								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Snapshot attaches the sensations of a few moments to a small item with a shiny surface - a bit of crystal, a bead, or some such. Anyone who touches the item will gain a weak impression of the information imprinted on it, and anyone who focuses their attention on that impression will experience the entire thing - whether that's the glory of a sunset, the awe of a mighty dragon passing over a town, or the burning sincerity of an oath of vengeance. For the most part, such trinkets are simply keepsakes, although they can also serve to preserve valuable information, or - at the option of the game master - to provide effects equivalent to a first-level morale-affecting spell of choice if they record a moment of great personal significance that is related to the current situation. If someone wants to review the evil overlords dozen terrible offenses against their friends and family before launching their attack, they'll probably qualify for the equivalent of a Wrath spell.
Dentistry							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched														DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Dentistry repairs and replaces teeth. While this has few direct game effects, someone who possesses this spell is generally welcome almost anywhere. It's better than being a bard; few things are more miserable than bad teeth.
Relieve Illness						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One sick creature														DURATION:Three saves.								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Relieve Illness provides its target with a +4 enhancement bonus on its recipients next three saving throws against disease, and reduces the attribute damage resulting from failed saves by two points each. It also usually makes the sufferer feel a great deal better.
Relieve Poison						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One poisoned creature													DURATION:Ten minutes.								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Relieve Illness provides its target with a +4 enhancement bonus on its recipients saves against poison, and reduces the attribute damage resulting from failed saves by two points each. If applied within one round after a poison takes effect, the benefits of the spell are effectively retroactive.
Process							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One cubic foot of material per level											DURATION:Instantaneous, Components: V, S, MF [the relevant tools]	SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:The various Process spells are each quite specific, and each can perform a particular, tedious bit of resource-processing. For example, Process [Card] pulls stickers, insects, and other contaminants out of wool. Process [Spin] turns raw fiber into thread. Process [Weave] turns fibers into cloth, and so on. Process does not provide materials, and does not bypass the need for the relevant tools or skill; it simply saves time. Fortunately, while each variant of Process is a separate spell, they're so much alike that anyone who leans one variant can be presumed to have also mastered four others. Alchemists and ritualists often have good uses for Process, since it can greatly reduce the tedium of their activities.
Preservation						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Up to ten pounds of unliving organic material per caster level						DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Preservation immediately dries, smokes, salts, jellies, spices, or otherwise preserves the affected material; the exact manner is up to the caster.
Unburn Meal							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Up to twenty pounds of food per level										DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Unburn Meal will fix minor culinary disasters - unburning roasts and stews, causing fallen souffles to rise again, and mending broken cakes.
Child Ward							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Universal		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One immature creature													DURATION:Twenty-four hours							SAVEINFO:Will Negates	SAVEINFO:None																									SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)	SPELLRES:See text	PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Spell Resistance - Only if the caster is not a parent, aunt, uncle, or grandparent of the creature targeted. Child Ward imprints a fraction of the caster's consciousness on the mind of the targeted child [a character with a maximum level of zero] as an advisor and guardian. While this can't always anticipate accidents, it can steer a child away from many kinds of risky behavior and help him or her deal sensibly with minor emergencies.
Expel Parasites						CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Universal		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One creature															DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Expel Parasites causes the targets body to expel parasites of all sorts - worms, rot grubs, cerebral parasites, things which burrow under the skin, and similar organisms. Like the Remove spell, Expel Parasites is very convenient when the characters are dealing with such perils - and fairly useless otherwise.

Spring Cleaning						CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to ((CASTERLEVEL)+6) major rooms (including closets and such)						DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Spring Cleaning will straighten up, throw out the trash, and clean and polish throughout a good sized house, tavern, or penthouse, or similar structure. More importantly from some viewpoints, it will neatly put things away where the caster would put them - making it easy to locate things in the area cleaned. Just as importantly from other viewpoints, it neatly hides the tell-tale traces of searches, clears up bloodstains, and polishes up the knives - while leaving no fingerprints or other personal traces behind at all. Anyone attempting to make deductions from the remaining evidence faces a +20 target number modifier.
Ward versus Vermin					CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:30 foot radius														DURATION:1d4+1 weeks								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Ward versus Vermin repels normal rats, mice, insects, and similar creatures, preventing them from entering the protected area unless they are intentionally brought in by a larger creature. While it will not drive out any such creatures which are already within the affected area, if they do venture out of it, they will not be able to return. Wards versus Vermin are very useful in keeping such pests out of food stores, and in maintaining the health of a population, but adventurer's are more often interested in keeping off disease carrying pests and swarm attacks. Unfortunately, Ward versus Vermin is incapable of keeping out monstrous vermin, such as giant centipedes and such - although it might make them hesitate briefly.
Fountain							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Conjuration	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to (CASTERLEVEL*50) gallons of water (about six and a half cubic feet or four hundred pounds)	DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Special																													SPELLRES:No						PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Fountain creates quite a lot of water, either as a downpour in an area anywhere up to twenty feet across, as a mass to fill containers, or as a wave or spray directed anywhere within range. A creature subjected to an instantaneous wave or spray may make a strength check [at +4 per size category above Medium or -4 per category below Medium, +4 if it's exceptionally stable for some reason] against a DC of (CASTERLEVEL+10) or be driven back five feet. A creature which fails to resist being driven back must make a reflex save to avoid falling down.
Hearthfire							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Conjuration	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:one 8 inch radius fire													DURATION:Twenty-four hours.							SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Hearthfire conjures a cheerful crackling little fire, suitable for providing light, warmth, and a place to cook or even to perform light metalworking - although, sadly, it's neither large nor hot enough for serious ironworking. Given that there's no actual combustion going on, the fire burns without fuel, smoke, or other waste products for the duration and cannot be smothered - although a couple of buckets of water or similar measures will extinguish it readily enough. Hearthfire can be a lifesaver in a blizzard or arctic adventure, makes an excellent beacon or signal fire, and eliminates the need to find or carry fuel - but it also finds a good deal of use in powering steam engines and heating underground areas, where a clean source of heat and light that doesn't use up fuel or oxygen is of great assistance. Hearthfire can be moved around in any container and does 1d4 points of damage per round if someone is in direct contact with it.
Find Stray							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Divination		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Ten miles	TARGETAREA:One domestic animal or child												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hour							SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Find Stray allows the user to sense the current location and approximate condition of an animal or child provided that he or she either starts out in the targets quarters or possesses some personal link to the target. Thus an animal can be traced starting from it's stall, a cow by a bit of it's milk or hair, a child from it's room of by using it's spare clothing, and so on. Creatures that are intentionally hiding from the caster receive a saving throw, those which are not so concealed - even if they are hiding from other creatures - do not. Adventurers usually find this useful for things like finding where the bandits are keeping their child-hostages, leading emergency search parties into sudden blizzards, and locating expensive beasts, such as trained hunting eagles.
Herb Mastery						CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Divination		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:2d4 packets of herbs													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) day							SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Herb Mastery allows it's user to blend any available herbs to produce sustaining and strengthening broths, infusions, and teas. Drinking such a brew is as sustaining as a normal meal for a medium creature, is loaded with all necessary vitamins and minerals, and cures one point of damage, up to a maximum of twelve points in any one day.
Harvest							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Enchantment	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to two acres														DURATION:10d6 Minutes.								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Harvest causes a crop to harvest itself; hay will gather itself into stacks, carrots will report to the root cellar, and fruit will climb into baskets store itself. The specifics are up to the caster; if he or she wants to harvest only the ripe fruit, or collect the eggs the hens are hiding but leave the ones being brooded, that's what he or she will get. The entire process requires some 10d6 minutes to complete, but is generally quiet and efficient. Complex situations or wild crops inhibit the spell; harvesting two acres of apples is easy, but the charm will barely suffice to harvest half an acre of wild truffles, and the process will require 1d6 hours rather than 10d6 minutes. Adventurers often use Harvest when a crop - or the situation it's in - is important and dangerous. If you need Telachian Venom-Fruit, and don't want to stir up the giant wasps which live in the grove, this is probably the spell to use. The wasps will probably come after you anyway, but at least you can set up your own position to meet them in.
Train Animal		KEY:TPE ~ Train Animal	CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Enchantment	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One domesticated animals													DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Train Animal instantly teaches a domestic animal basic good behavior - although it doesn't necessarily give it the desire to please it's owner. Still, you can instantly housebreak your new puppy and teach it not to growl at or bite the children, to come when called [if it isn't too distracted, upset, or frightened], and to otherwise be an acceptable companion or work animal. The use of this spell will also half the time required to teach an animal more advanced skills, such as sheep herding, but does not help an animal learn to handle the stress of operating in combat situations; such training must be conducted normally.
Tree to Lumber						CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Evocation		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One cut down or otherwise deceased tree										DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Tree to Lumber neatly breaks a dead tree down into a caster-specified collection of smooth, well-cut boards, shingles, sheets, pulp, stakes, reasonably-sized chunks for firewood, and other bits and pieces - saving a great deal of labor, avoiding waste, and avoiding the need for a sawmill. For the common folk, this is a tremendous timesaver. It's pretty much the same for adventurers when they need to build a raft, boat, ladder, or what-have-you on the spot.
Dreamcatcher						CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Illusion		COMPS:V, S, MF	CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched														DURATION:Special									SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Dreamcatcher grants a toy an illusion of life - a comforting mental presence that can whisper reassurance, provide sensible [if rather dim] advice, and which can chase away bad dreams. The effect is actually purely mental; the psychic construct is sustained by the spell recipients desire and needs. It can be temporarily dispelled - but will soon return unless the creature sustaining it is convinced that it has truly been destroyed and stays so convinced. Dreamcatchers are normally pretty ineffectual, but can manifest as fairly formidable guardians if someone ventures into their hosts mind- or dream-scape [either improvise - this would be a dream-scenario after all - or go ahead and use the Dreamspawn template to represent the thing].
Render							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Up to one large corpse or the equivalent										DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Render instantly breaks down deceased animal tissue into neat little piles and puddles of fat and glycerin, clean bone and bone meal, cuts of meat, sinew, hide, and other meat by-products. If the caster possesses enough biochemical knowledge, he or she may also extract various hormones, toxins, and enzymes  although he or she will need a selection of suitable bottles and containers for all of the meat by-products to go in. While this saves no end of time and noisome labor for common folk, for adventurers, Render principally comes into play when they're trying to collect pieces from some fantastic creature  or are trying to make something poisonous edible.
Weedkill							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to one acre														DURATION:Special									SAVEINFO:Reflex Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Weedkill is pretty straightforward: it instantaneously does 1d4 points of damage to each weed in the affected area and prevents new weeds from sprouting, and any surviving weeds from growing or healing appreciably for the next month. The spell is effective on an assortment of blights, rusts, and fungi, as well as on more conventional weeds, but mobile plants often evade the effects. It works nicely on aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation as well; making it easy to clear overgrown shorelines and choked waterways. Indiscriminate use of this spell is likely to upset the local druids and nature spirits however.
Sow								CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One acre maximum														DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Sow scatters and tamps in if necessary up to five hundred pounds of unresisting material over an area of up to one acre either evenly or in some simple pattern (such as even rows). Such material arrives with no particular force behind it, and in no particular orientation. It's commonly used for sowing seed, spreading fertilizer or lime, and scattering straw or compost. Pranksters often use it to scatter mud or other minor debris over their targets. More militaristic applications are possible, but depend on having something appropriate ready to hand. If you just happen to have a huge stock of caltrops, or heated, flaming, oil, or green slime, or some such, you may be able to cause a great deal of havoc with a bit of simple hedge wizardry. Of course, that kind of thing rarely comes up without a good deal of careful planning and preparation.
Thresh							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Special															DURATION:Time of Concentration						SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Thresh converts a steady stream of rice, grain, corn on the cob, or similar foodstuffs into separate streams of prepared seed and husks. Similarly, fruit can be peeled, pitted, and cored, roots can be cleaned and pulped, and fish can be filleted. While the material to be so processed must be unresisting, and must all be processed in the same, simple, way, the spell allows such processing to be performed as quickly as (Wis) men could normally do it. Sadly, while Thresh is another enormously useful spell for the general population, adventurer's rarely have too much use for it.
The Laborers's Word					CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Universal		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Special															DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:The Laborer's Word simply does work  equivalent to that performed by a healthy, well-equipped, laborer working with the caster's skills for one hour plus one additional hour [to a maximum of eight] per three levels or part thereof. Sadly, the spell cannot work against resistance; living targets must willingly accept being brushed/cleaned/whatever. Similarly, it cannot overcome conditions which would balk a normal laborer, such as magical defenses, people holding doors shut or defending the barricade you want to tear down, and so on. Tools are unnecessary, but materials suitable for the task in question must be available if any are required; the spell can comb hair and straighten clothing on it's own, but if you want it to darn socks, it will need a bit of yarn to work with. Outside of those limitations, the nature of the task does not matter; the spell will cook, clean, hammer out metalwork, dig out coal, or dig ditches just as well as the caster could  or better, if, say, the caster happens to be bedridden at the moment. Such work cannot be "dispelled"; it's actually done. It can be undone through normal means however.
Turn Soil							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Universal		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:up to two acres														DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users							SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Turn Soil loosens, aerates, and turns the soil in an area as if it had been ploughed  readying the area for planting and cultivation in mere moments. The effect, while unspectacular, is pretty fundamental to civilization.

In general, it can handle any simple, mundane, inedible, implement worth 5 GP or less. Such items are fully functional, but are never masterwork and always appear a bit cartoonish.

SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:2,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users,01 - Allow Techno Hedge Magic Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Powercell can either instantaneously recharge up to one small chemical energy cell per level of the caster [it doesn't matter if said power cell is supposed to be rechargeable or not] or it can directly power a device designed to operate on such power sources for one hour per level of the caster. While such power cells are insufficient to power effective energy weapons other than tasers, radios, lights, and laptop computers are all excellent targets for this spell.

SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:2,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users,01 - Allow Techno Hedge Magic Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Generator can instantaneously recharge a set of powerful chemical batteries, storage systems, or fuel cells [car batteries, capacitance systems, and so on] or effectively replace a small generator for up to one hour per level of the caster. While this is generally still too limited a source to power effective energy weapons other than tasers and sensory-assault systems, most personal machines will operate quite well on such a power supply.
Goldberg							CLASSES:ALL=1	SCHOOL:Illusion		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One device															DURATION:Special.									SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:2,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users,01 - Allow Techno Hedge Magic Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Goldberg allows the user to tinker up an improvised repair or component replacement on a device  whether that's a spacecraft air recycler, a power generator, or a vehicle engine. Such improvisations are generally bulky, clumsy, and unreliable  but they will work to some extent if the user manages to make a successful skill roll. Such repairs normally last some 1D6 days, but rush jobs [such as getting the engine working before the plane crashes] reduces the duration to 2D6 minutes. Each time the duration on a "Goldberged" repair runs out, there is a 1 in 6 chance that further attempts will be ineffective. Eventually, you simply have to do it right.

A saw would be as effective [and quick and easy to use] as a chainsaw, a hand drill as a heavy power drill, and a sledgehammer as a jackhammer or mining machine.

For good or ill, unlike "Create Water" and similar spells, Fuel requires an appropriate container. If you want the stuff spread around, or dumped into an existing fire, the caster will simply have to do it physically.
Macgyver							CLASSES:ALL=2	SCHOOL:Universal		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Special															DURATION:Special.									SAVEINFO:Will Negates																												SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)				PRETEMPLATE:2,01 - Allow Hedge Magic Spells for non-feat users,01 - Allow Techno Hedge Magic Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	DESC:Macgyver is a blatantly silly spell that allows a tinkerer to ignore the practical details of some bit of gadgeteering. Applying it to devices that ought to work in theory allows them to work in practice  at least once. Sadly, this requires the player to provide a description of how the device is supposed to work and what the user is using for components. In general, the simpler and more reasonable the device [and the higher level the caster], the less detail will be required by the GM.

While such kits will disappear again in a few hours, any minor supplies used from them  bandages, solder, makeup, and so on  is real and permanent.

While it can't perform truly major feats  replacing automobile engines or rebuilding a computer from a pile of scraps  it can fix minor component damage and losses, restore broken wiring, fix power supplies, and lubricate jammed parts. If a technician could normally take the item to his or her shop and expect to fix it without too much in the way of special-order parts, Technical Mastery will fix it instantly.
