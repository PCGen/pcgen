Character Creation Duties				KEY:Duties (+2)					OUTPUTNAME:Duties				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General			DESC:(+2) A character with Duties has extensive obligations. These restrict his or her time and freedom of action, as well as draining his or her resources, but also mean getting a lot of practice or extra training. This typically includes Druids, Clerics, and Paladins. Ignoring your duties brings on various penalties. Strangely, this continues until the GM feels you have enough penalties to equal the points you got from Duties.	DESC: &nl;You have duties. Grants 2 CP per level.

Specialized versions are available and encouraged. No one may take Fast Learner more than once unless it's been built into a template, race, or class by the Game Master.

Character Creation Restrictions			KEY:Eclipse Restrictions			OUTPUTNAME:Restrictions			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General			DESC:A character with restrictions has major limitations on the use of some ability or type of equipment. He or she may never (ever!) acquire or use such talents without major penalties. For example, Witch- Hunters never cast spells except to fix the problems caused by other magic on pain of losing most of their abilities. The point bonus is per category which applies. A character only gains the bonus points for restrictions on things that would obviously useful to him or her. Common restrictions include wearing no armor, using no weapons, using no magic or psionics, or skill-related feats. A good explanation is in order. Why is the character restricted in this way?	DESC: &nl;You have specified restrictions. Gain 1 CP per level per restriction.

This modifier goes away - and the character gets to spend those CP - when he or she gets trained, starts to take an interest, or finds a talent (if any).	DESC: &nl;You lack training for whatever reason. -6 CP per level.

Character Creation Very Limited Spell List	KEY:Very Limited Spell List (+1/2 CP)	OUTPUTNAME:Very Limited Spell List	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Character Creation.CharCreation.General			DESC:(+.5) The character's spell lists are unusually specialized, or otherwise restricted, for his or her magic style and class. The Paladin doesn't receive this, because his or her spell list covers nearly anything he or she might want to do and even offers some unique and powerful spells. Rangers, on the other hand, don't have nearly the versatility they arguably should get, so they receive this small bonus.	DESC: &nl;You have a restricted spell list. Gain 1/2 CP per level.

This would require one roll, at the highest DC incurred by any single action.

# Action Hero Choices
Action Hero / Heroism													KEY:Action Hero ~ Heroism							SORTKEY:Action Hero_1b													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.ActionHeroChoice																																																																																																																								DESC:allows you to spend one Action Point per round to improve a single character-action roll (NOT a hit point or other character development check) by 1d6. At level 8+ roll 2d6 and apply the best one, at 15+ roll 3d6 and apply the best one, and at 22+ roll 4d6 and apply the best one. Totaled multipledie rolls, such as the damage from a Fireball or a highlevel rogue's Sneak Attack, may add the total instead of keeping only the best die. An Action Point may be spent on Heroism after the roll is made, but must be spent before the Game Master announces the result. Action Points cannot be used if you're "Taking 10" or "Taking 20."
Action Hero / Stunt													KEY:Action Hero ~ Stunt								SORTKEY:Action Hero_1c													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.ActionHeroChoice																																																																																																																								DESC:temporarily enhances your current abilities by a total of +6 CP. Constant-effect abilities purchased in this fashion work for one minute. Other abilities last for one round. In any case, the extra CP can only be used to enhance abilities related to your current talents and must be approved by the Game Master. They may, however, exceed the normal purchase limits. "Stunts" may be Corrupted or Specialized under the usual rules. Popular uses of this ability include taking an extra Standard Action (Reflex Training), gaining an extra use of any "uses-per-time period" ability (Bonus Uses), or automatically stabilizing your condition (Grant of Aid). "Taking 20" when this is not normally allowed (Luck), making a mighty effort (Hysteria), instantly refreshing a spell slot (Invocation), or "throwing off" mental influences (Immunity; the influence is gone for good if the power in question has a specified duration, but comes back after a minute if it's permanent) are also popular.	DESC: &nl;Temporarily enhances your current abilities by a total of +6 CP. Constant-effect abilities work for one minute. Other abilities last one round.
Action Hero / Crafting													KEY:Action Hero ~ Crafting							SORTKEY:Action Hero_1d													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.ActionHeroChoice																																																																																																																								DESC:lets a character with the appropriate skills and abilities expend Action Points in lieu of the time and XP that would normally be required to complete a project; the user is simply presumed to "have been working on it." In general, it costs 1 AP to complete a minor project, such as forging a masterwork dagger, scribing a couple of ordinary scrolls, or brewing a couple of potions. Notable projects, such as a wand, cost 3. Impressive projects, such as building a small boat or a minor permanent enchantment, cost 6. Major projects, such as building a private tower in the woods, enchanting midrange permanent items, or making a lesser magical staff, cost 10. Huge projects, such as enchanting a ship, creating a powerful permanent item, or making a major magical staff, cost 15. Finally, Grandiose projects, such as creating an epic item or building a fortification, cost 21. Crafting is useful in games which don't allow a lot of downtime for would-be crafters and enchanters to work in. Without it they may never get to use the abilities they've purchased. The Game Master is entitled to some advance notice of any project worth 10 AP or more.
Action Hero / Invention													KEY:Action Hero ~ Invention							SORTKEY:Action Hero_1e													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.ActionHeroChoice																																																																																																																								DESC:lets a character expend Action Points to develop new technologies, jury-rig equipment, create new spells, or simply to have brilliant ideas (i.e., getting a suggestion from the Game Master). A simple idea costs a mere 1 AP and a temporary jury-rig costs 1d3. Inventions are quite expensive, however. A minor improvement to an existing design costs 2 AP, an original design 4 AP, a minor innovation 7, a notable development 10, a dramatic discovery 15, and brand new fields of technology 25. Paying the base costs results in a prototype that only the inventor can effectively use or maintain. Twice that allows the inventor to make and sell the item, but others cannot - although they may begin investing AP in the invention as well. When the total reaches three times the base cost, the device can be duplicated by the creator's students. At four times the base AP cost specialists throughout the campaign will be able to make devices using the principles of the item, and at five times the base AP cost, it becomes generally available.
Action Hero / Influence													KEY:Action Hero ~ Influence							SORTKEY:Action Hero_1f													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.ActionHeroChoice																																																																																																																								DESC:allows you to spend AP to manipulate largescale events. For example, a minor change, such as getting the taxes on a village reduced or forgiven for a year, would cost 1 AP. Getting backing for an expedition or getting someone pardoned for a fairly serious offence might cost 3. Impressive requests, such as a raid or rescue expedition across a border, cost 6. Major changes, such as settling an inheritance dispute or getting a grant of lands might cost 10. Huge changes, such as getting a modest war started or settled, cost 15. Grandiose changes, such as changing a state religion or starting a crusade, cost 21. Influence is particularly useful when some of the players want to meddle in politics while the others simply want to fight things.

Adaptation																																										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable																																																																																																																						DESC:(6 CP). Adaptation allows you to become accustomed to a stressful environment, position, or situation, avoiding it's penalties. For example, you can become used to fighting while prone, while on the pitching deck of a ship, while climbing, or while in zeroor high-gravity environments. Adaption to the desert or to an arctic environment would negate the effects of environmental stress, movement penalties, and similar annoyances in that environment. A social specialist could even become used to working with a hostile audience, and no longer suffer penalties to his or her skills in such situations. Unless combined with some form of Damage Reduction, or other appropriate defense, Adaption does not suffice for survival in environments which inflict damage on a per-round basis. !

Their equipment is up to the GM, but is usually typical for NPCs. Their levels may be increased, or additional followers may be added, as you go up in level; the Game Master should make adjustments. While followers are not slavishly loyal unless the character truly deserves such loyalty, they are reliable within reason.

Mana can help with spellcasting, while Power often fuels meditative or martial arts abilities aside from psychic powers. Unfortunately, while Mana is extremely flexible, it recovers at a mere one point per day, two with rest and meditation. Power and generic spell levels recover each day, as usual. As a general rule, 1 point of Mana equates to 2 spell levels or 4 Psionic Power - or one charge from a magic item. Mana is commonly used to power exotic abilities. Abilities which would normally be uses-per day may be designated as using personal Mana instead at 1 use for 2 Mana.

A minor detail consistent with the setting (say, a convenient tapestry or chandelier in the castle hall) costs 1-3 Mana. Notable, but plausible, additions (say a weak link in the chains or a handy display of weapons on a castle wall) cost 3-5. Major, unlikely, additions (a handy secret passage in your palace, a rescue party showing up two days early) cost 5-10 if the GM opts to allow them at all. Reality editing is always subject to GM approval. GM's who are quick-thinking and extremely flexible may opt to allow Grandiose additions. Be warned; even at a cost of 9-15 Mana this has the effect of turning over much of the plot and mood of the game to the players.

SOURCEPAGE:p.36
Mana / Unskilled Magic													KEY:Mana ~ Unskilled Magic							SORTKEY:Mana_2d					OUTPUTNAME:Unskilled Magic					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:NaturalMagicChoice.EclipseAbilityOutput																																																																																																																								DESC:You may simply announce the spell effect you're trying to produce and dump Mana into it. Whatever-it-is you're trying to do will cost 2 Mana per level of the effect - half of which is wasted and a quarter of which goes into random side effects. The Casting Level equals the user's level or (Int/3 + the effect level), whichever is less. The maximum level of effect which can be produced equals the user's base Will save bonus or (Wis/3), whichever is less. Keeping the side effects down to displays and inconvenient effects (rather than dangerous ones) requires a Cha check at a DC of ([2x the Mana used] + 6). The side effects are always up to the Game Master. Effects with an extended duration usually require that the caster invest Mana in them; some or all of the Mana used to cast them cannot be recovered while they persist. This does make it easier to cast long-term spells. Unlike most spellcasting, unskilled magic works better under stress. Characters who are furiously angry, utterly outraged, or otherwise on an emotional peak, gain one free point of Mana, which may be spent in excess of the above limits or be used to reduce the cost. Characters who have just seen their lover or child die, are facing certain death, or who are otherwise in the throes of some great passion, get two. Characters who are dying, or who are willing to die in the casting, get four. Even a relatively unskilled dabbler may be able to manage a decent dying curse.

Theurgy																																										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:General.EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.Corruptable																																																																																																																						DESC:(6 CP). You've found a way to link divine and arcane magic. In general, converting between the druid, bard, and wizard/sorcerer lists adds one level, as does converting between the druid, ranger, paladin, and cleric lists. Any other conversions, such as between cleric and wizard, add +2 levels unless the Game Master rules otherwise. The user must either have access to the spell to be converted (whether personally or from a friend, scroll, or deity) or must research it normally. Thus a cleric who wants to learn Fireball can either learn it from a wizard or research it, but it becomes fifth level as a clerical spell in any case. The level adjustment applies even if the spell is present, and of lower level, on the list in question anyway. Converting the arcane version of Bull's Strength to a clerical spell results in an inefficient fourth level spell.

This requires an attribute check (usually Int or Cha for Arcane casters, Wis for Divine casters, or the relevant attribute for a Psychic) with a DC of 11/13/15/17/21 for level 0/1/2/3/4 effects.

In practical terms, it means that in games where the GM restricts spells from the normal lists based on the deity's personality (i.e., the Ocean god doesn't give out Flamestrike), the priest may still use them. Similarly, you're much less likely to be assigned a quest, can use spells with any alignment descriptor regardless of your alignment, and generally don't have anyone keeping an judgmental eye on you.
