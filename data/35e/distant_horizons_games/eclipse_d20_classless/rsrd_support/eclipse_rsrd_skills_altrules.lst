# Skill Name	Unique Key						Key Stat	Untrained?		Skill Penalty?	Type									Description
Acrobatics		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Acrobatics		KEYSTAT:DEX				ACHECK:YES		TYPE:Dexterity.DEX.Base.Eclipse.Acrobatics		DESC: Includes Balance, Escape Artist, Ride, and Tumble. At rank 8 you may take 3d4 damage to pull off an nigh-impossible stunt - dislocating your bones to escape chains, jumping down a series of falling rocks to break a fall, or some such. At Rank 16 the damage from such a stunt is reduced to 2d4, and at rank 24 to 1d4.
Appraise		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Appraise			KEYSTAT:INT							TYPE:Intelligence.INT.Base.Eclipse.Appraise		DESC: May be used to identify magical items, evaluate animals, and bargain. Characters with at least (Level/2) ranks of Appraise effectively get 10% extra when treasure or rewards are split up. Those with at least (Level) ranks of Appraise get 20% extra. This doesn't actually reduce anyone's allotment of treasure; those who are skilled in getting the best prices can simply make their cash go further. Why are these shifting minimums? Because you're presumed to be buying level-appropriate stuff for the most part - and thus will be negotiating with higher-level sellers with better skills of their own.
Athletics		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Athletics		KEYSTAT:DEX				ACHECK:YES		TYPE:Dexterity.DEX.Base.Eclipse.Athletics			DESC: Includes Climb, Jump and Swim. Also covers things like power-lifting, kicking open doors, running marathons, outrunning monsters, and similar activities. The user may make an Athletics check instead of a straight attribute check for such attempts. At rank 8 you may take 3d4 damage to pull off an nigh-impossible stunt - briefly supporting an impossible weight, dashing across water for a few seconds, sinking your fingers into the stone of a wall while falling past it to try to climb it again, diving off a cliff with a rope to catch up to a falling individual and catch them, and so on. At Rank 16 the damage from such a stunt is reduced to 2d4, and at rank 24 to 1d4.
Arcana		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Arcana			KEYSTAT:INT							TYPE:Intelligence.INT.Base.Eclipse.Arcana			DESC: Includes Knowledge/Arcana, Knowledge/Psionics, Psicraft, and Spellcraft, as well as performing magical rituals. Every three full ranks of Arcana allows the user to employ one minor ritual, even without any special ritual feats or abilities.
Concentration	KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Concentration		KEYSTAT:CON							TYPE:Constitution.CON.Base.Eclipse.Concentration	DESC: Covers Autohypnosis, Concentration, and Control Shape. May also be used to briefly withstand dangerous forces given a few moments to prepare - for example, performing classical firewalking (DC 14), reaching into a furnace to pull out that magical blade without hurting yourself (DC 18), pulling free a high-voltage line without injury (DC 24).
Craft			KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Craft			KEYSTAT:INT							TYPE:Intelligence.INT.Base.Eclipse.Craft			DESC: Craft ranks apply to (3 + Int Mod) areas. For example a Wizard with Int 16 could be skilled in Alchemy, Engraving, Glassblowing, Goldsmithing, Gemcutting, and Bladesmithing - everything he needs to make most magical devices. Anyone with at least (Level/2) ranks in Craft can live a reasonable lifestyle for their level by spending a few hours a day using their skills. Anyone with at least (Level) ranks in Craft can live an excellent lifestyle for their level in the same way.
Deception		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Deception		KEYSTAT:CHA							TYPE:Charisma.CHA.Base.Eclipse.Deception			DESC: Includes Bluff and Disguise as well as setting up diversions, con artistry, phony accounting, and coming up with believable false rationales. At rank 10+ you may use up to (Cha Mod) levels worth of appropriate Enchantment/Charm spells of up to level three daily through your words alone (Save DC is Charisma-Based, Caster Level = User Level). At rank 20+ the limit increases to spell level five and (2x Cha Mod) spell levels. At rank 30+ the limit increases to spell level seven and (3x Cha Mod) spell levels - the maximum. Appropriate spells include things like Hideous Laughter, Taunt, Glibness, Mindless Rage, Rebuke, Suggestion, Daze and Daze Monster (briefly dazing people with outrageous insults), Crushing Despair, Shock and Awe, and so on.
Engineering		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Engineering		KEYSTAT:INT							TYPE:Intelligence.INT.Base.Eclipse.Engineering		DESC: Includes Knowledge/Architecture and Engineering, building and operating siege engines, machinery, mills, clockwork, hydraulics, pneumatics, deducing things about structures (such as locating secret rooms, passages, and doors), finding weak points to attack (can effectively double damage against inanimate objects with a GMO check), building gadgets, and working with pretty much anything else mechanical. Engineers may specify one quasi-magical gadget they routinely carry for every three full ranks in engineering that they carry, and may trade these out given a week or two. If you want a pocket full of smoke pellets, a clockwork mechanism that fast-reloads your heavy crossbow five times before it needs ten minutes rewinding, a spring-loaded sleeve-grapnel, a sword that can fire it's blade at an opponent, sneezing powder, and other gizmos, then this is the skill for you.
Heal			KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Heal			KEYSTAT:WIS							TYPE:Wisdom.WIS.Base.Eclipse.Heal				DESC: Includes surgery, psychotherapy, acupuncture, herbalism, minor magical rituals of healing, and advanced medicine. Users with at least four ranks may attempt a DC 15/25/35 check to reproduce the effects of a L1/L2/L3 curative spell up to (Wis Mod) times per day - although they may not "take 20? on this check.

Being based on Int, this covers the free extra languages you get for a high intelligence.
Local Knowledge	KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Local Knowledge	KEYSTAT:INT							TYPE:Intelligence.INT.Base.Eclipse.Local Knowledge	DESC: is a downright supernatural knack; it covers knowing about trails, bars, customs, stories, major individuals, businesses, traditions, creatures in the area, and so on EVERYWHERE YOU GO. If you only want to know about a PARTICULAR area, spend 1 SP to get a +15 on that specific location. It's a LOT easier to know all about Allentown PA than it is to know that much about every location on Earth.
Perception		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Perception		KEYSTAT:WIS							TYPE:Wisdom.WIS.Base.Eclipse.Perception			DESC: Includes Search, Spot, Listen, and (for that matter) smell checks. Optionally, characters with at least (Level) ranks in Perception may receive a +1 Synergy Bonus on Reflex Saves. Perception is so useful that it doesn't really need sweetening, but that seems reasonable.
Perform		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Perform			KEYSTAT:CHA							TYPE:Charisma.CHA.Base.Eclipse.Perform			DESC: Perform ranks apply to (3 + Int Mod) areas, as with Craft. Anyone with at least (Level/2) ranks in Perform can live a reasonable lifestyle for their level by spending a few hours a day using their skills.

Religion		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Religion			KEYSTAT:INT							TYPE:Intelligence.INT.Base.Eclipse.Religion		DESC: Includes Knowledge/Religion, Knowledge/The Planes, and religious ceremonies. At 6+ ranks this includes the ability to cast three 0-level clerical spells per day. At 12+ ranks it provides +1 bonus level of religious spellcasting (cleric, druid, or similar). At 18+ ranks it provides access to a Domain, and at 24+ ranks it provides an additional bonus level of religious spellcasting.
Profession		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Profession		KEYSTAT:WIS	USEUNTRAINED:NO				TYPE:Wisdom.WIS.Base.Eclipse.Profession			DESC: Profession skills are broad-based. For example, Profession / Sailor may be used to tie knots and use rope, predict the weather at sea, navigate, climb and balance in the rigging, patch sails, do basic carpentry on hulls, and load and fire cannons.

Socialize		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Socialize		KEYSTAT:WIS							TYPE:Wisdom.WIS.Base.Eclipse.Socialize			DESC: Includes Gather Information, Handle Animal, and Sense Motive - as well as serious partying. Each two full ranks in Socialize provides the user with a valuable contact - someone with special skills, unusual abilities, political influence, or similar - which he or she is willing to use to help the character out, at least within reason.
Stealth		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Stealth			KEYSTAT:DEX							TYPE:Dexterity.DEX.Base.Eclipse.Stealth			DESC: Includes Hide and Move Silently as well as setting up camouflage, smuggling things past searches, hiding things. At rank 8+ you can hide things about your person so well that even the universe loses track of them, giving the user the equivalent of a built-in, nondispellable, Handy Haversack. At rank 16+ you may become invisible (as per Improved Invisibility) for a total of (Dex Mod) minutes (in total, counting per round, activation is a free action) per day. At rank 24+ you may become incorporeal for a total of (Dex Mod) rounds per day, as per Improved Invisibility, above.
Survival		KEY:Alt Rule Skill ~ Survival			KEYSTAT:INT							TYPE:Intelligence.INT.Base.Eclipse.Survival		DESC: Includes Knowledge/Nature, Survival, and Use Rope.

At rank 24+ the user may, once per day, attempt to steal magical properties or abilities - although the user may only have one such property or ability in his or her possession at a time. Thus, one day, he might steal a mages Disintegrate spell, using it a day later. Next up, the magic of a sword, transferring it to a sword of his or her own. The day after? A use of a dragon's breath weapon, leaving it having to wait another 1d4 rounds to use it.
