Way of the Lands / Landrule			KEY:Way of the Lands ~ Landrule			SORTKEY:Dominion_1a	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfTheLands		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Dominion							DESC:(+6 CP, requires Dominion). Lords with Landrule may sense disturbances in their home realms. Aside from that, you may use Commune with Nature at any place within it at will.

Way of the Lands / Spirit Speech		KEY:Way of the Lands ~ Spirit Speech		SORTKEY:Dominion_1b	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfTheLands		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of the Lands ~ Landrule				DESC:(+6 CP, requires Landrule). Spirit Speech allows you to communicate with natural beings who dwell within your realm. While it doesn't guarantee cooperation, few creatures attempt to eat or attack something talking to them, and if you keep the peace within your realm most Nature Spirits will assent to everyday requests. This doesn't allow you to contact Realm Spirits, such as the spirits of mighty rivers, storms, or whole forests unless you spend 5 DP to make contact and more to influence them. See page 168 for a description of Nature and Realm Spirits. Spirit Call (+6 CP, requires Spirit Speech). You may now contact all Nature Spirits, even Realm Spirits, as long as they are within your realm, no matter how far away you are. Realm Spirits will normally consider you a youthful peer.																							COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Way of the Lands / Spirit Channeling	KEY:Way of the Lands ~ Spirit Channeling		SORTKEY:Dominion_1c	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfTheLands		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of the Lands ~ Spirit Call			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Spirit Call). You may spend 1 DP to tap into the power of any special magical resources which are a part of your realm. Inanimate resources, such as a healing spring or enchanted forest, can be tapped automatically. Living creatures, such as Nature Spirits, must consent to your use of their power. In any case, you may use the power you've called upon as many times as you can manage within one minute or for up to an hour for ongoing effects. Naturally enough, what can be accomplished through Spirit Channeling depends on how many power sources a realm contains and how cooperative its spirits are.

You become a Realm Spirit and gain the template found on page 169. Congratulations, you just retired! More seriously, you don't actually need to take on the template until you die physically. In the meantime, you will automatically feel injuries to, and disturbances of, your realm, may spend your vitality (HP) to enhance its health and fertility, and may expend 5 DP and a relevant spell to cast a spell on the Battle Magic/Epic scale - enchanting your realm for a month, raising a small army of summoned creatures, raising a fortress, healing injuries to the land, surrounding your realm with a wall of fire or an impenetrable mist, or some similar feat. While this bypasses the usual '10,000 GP worth of gear" requirement, casting such a spell still requires a full month.																			COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.73

# The Way of Omnipresence
Way of Omnipresence / Ears of the Wind	KEY:Way of Omnipresence ~ Ears of the Wind	SORTKEY:Dominion_2a	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfOmnipresence	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Dominion							DESC:(+6 CP, requires Dominion). With Ears of the Wind, you may hear a snippet of conversation every time you are mentioned anywhere in the plane. You can turn this ability off. This is identical to the Path of the Dragon ability, but does not meet any other prerequisites for progression along that path.																																																																																																									COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Way of Omnipresence / Multitasking		KEY:Way of Omnipresence ~ Multitasking		SORTKEY:Dominion_2b	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfOmnipresence	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Omnipresence ~ Ears of the Wind		DESC:(+6 CP, requires Ears of the Wind). You may use whatever divination, clairvoyance, or similar powers you possess to watch up to (character level) events, locations, or situations at once. You take no penalty for this, and may still act normally. In other words, you can easily focus as much mental effort as is needed on any one problem, without fragmenting your mind. Characters without clairvoyant powers may still listen to multiple sets of advisors, read several reports at once, keep an eye on the children, and practice fencing, all at the same time.																																																														COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Way of Omnipresence / Seal of Silence	KEY:Way of Omnipresence ~ Seal of Silence		SORTKEY:Dominion_2c	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfOmnipresence	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Omnipresence ~ Multitasking		DESC:(+6 CP, requires Multitasking). This impressive ability allows you to enforce silence on a location, topic, or person, so that none within your realm may speak on that subject and divinations fail. While expensive, it effectively controls public discourse by denying opponents the ability to communicate ideas. 2 DP per month wards an area the size of a city block, which also protects it from scrying or sensing magic. 3 DP per month wards a group of people up to 100 members from such scrying and prevents anyone from talking about the group. You may specify whether the group members may talk about it. For 1 Godfire point, you may enforce silence on an entire idea or topic. This lasts for 6 months in all cases.																																			COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Way of Omnipresence / Know the Flock	KEY:Way of Omnipresence ~ Know the Flock		SORTKEY:Dominion_2d	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfOmnipresence	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Omnipresence ~ Multitasking		DESC:(+6 CP, requires Multitasking). With Know the Flock, you automatically sense all major influences on your followers, including influential people and ideas. Furthermore, you know if any powerful or important magical item, sentient or otherwise, currently impacts your loyal subjects. You have a good idea of what your followers are doing. This can extend beyond your realm, but only where a large number of your subjects dwell.																																																																																			COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Omnipresence / The Spark Within	KEY:Way of Omnipresence ~ The Spark Within	SORTKEY:Dominion_2e	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfOmnipresence	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Omnipresence ~ Know the Flock		DESC:(+6 CP, requires Know the Flock). Favored by deities, the Spark Within allows you to send omens, visions, and to speak with your followers at will. You are not limited by range or dimension.																																																																																																																											COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Omnipresence / Revelation		KEY:Way of Omnipresence ~ Revelation		SORTKEY:Dominion_2f	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfOmnipresence	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Omnipresence ~ The Spark Within		DESC:(+6 CP, requires The Spark Within). Revelation is used for large-scale conversion of groups to your cause or religion. It does not compel individuals, but the effects are noticeable on a grand level involving thousands. First, you must a select a target, usually a society, class, or subculture of no less than 500 people and no more than 5000. You spend 6 DP, and roll percentile dice. The dice indicate the percentage of followers you convert. Note that doing this is an open invitation to reprisals from other lords, and the individuals in question will not at first be particularly loyal or faithful. If you don't deliver better conditions or otherwise please the targets, they will revert to their original attitudes.																																		COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74

# The Way of Valour
Way of Valour / Voice of Command		KEY:Way of Valour ~ Voice of Command		SORTKEY:Dominion_3a	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Dominion							DESC:(+6 CP, requires Dominion). People will obey you whenever you give out orders appropriate to the situation. This doesn't help you against enemies, but anyone who is looking for a leader, is confused, is simply used to following orders and has no urgent reason to disobey, or is in need of aid, will gladly follow you. There is no save unless a given individual sees him- or her- self as a competitor.																																																																																								COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Valour / The Rightful King		KEY:Way of Valour ~ The Rightful King		SORTKEY:Dominion_3b	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Valour ~ Voice of Command			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Voice of Command). Portents and signs cause everyone to recognize you as a True King. Not only may you now describe how glorious you look whenever you want, but everyone must acknowledge that you are truly meant to rule. Add +2 to your level when determining how many levels you have to allocate to your followers if you have Leadership. Their maximum level does not increase.																																																																																									COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Valour / Heroism				KEY:Way of Valour ~ Heroism				SORTKEY:Dominion_3c	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Valour ~ The Rightful King			DESC:(+6 CP, requires The Rightful King). With Heroism, every 10 DP you spend allows you to gain +1 hit point, permanently. At best, this can increase your pool of hit points up to what you could have had if you rolled the maximum on each hit die. In effect, this ability can maximize each hit die retroactively - given the DP.																																																																																																					COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Valour / Epic Heroism			KEY:Way of Valour ~ Epic Heroism			SORTKEY:Dominion_3d	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Valour ~ Heroism				DESC:(+6 CP, requires Heroism). You may temporarily awaken your latent Path. Pick a template worth up to +4 ECL when you select this ability. You may take it on for the 24 hours by expending (2 x ECL) DP. You may also spend 2 DP when they're conceived to pass the template in question on to your children.

Way of Valour / Warband				KEY:Way of Valour ~ Warband				SORTKEY:Dominion_3e	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Valour ~ The Rightful King			DESC:(+6 CP, requires The Rightful King). Choose a circle of up to five close allies and trusted friends. For every 5 character levels you have over an individual, he or she gains +1 Positive Level (page 86).																																																																																																																									COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Valour / Gift of Tongues		KEY:Way of Valour ~ Gift of Tongues			SORTKEY:Dominion_3f	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Valour ~ Voice of Command			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Voice of Command). You now understand all languages, from everywhere, including ones not subscribing to a mode of thought or reality akin your own. No code, misstatement, or encryption can fool you. Lies can. Wrath of the Overlord																																																																																																																	COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Valour / Curse				KEY:Way of Valour ~ Curse				SORTKEY:Dominion_3g	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Dominion							DESC:(+6 CP, requires Dominion). You may spend DP to shape the destiny of those who oppose you. 2 DP creates a minor curse, 4 DP fashions a major curse, and 6 DP fashions an awesome curse. These curses work on groups or family lines, not individuals - unless that individual is powerful enough to personally count as a major factor in world affairs. Curses on individuals are normally handled by simple spells. Curses have three rules, listed below. They must be vague. You cannot describe an exact effect, only a general idea. "-6 Con Score" is not acceptable. "The Curse of Wasting" is good. Curses can produce backlash and cause you trouble now and then. Normally, this means you'll share the curse for a while or have bad luck for a few weeks for calling one. All curses have an escape hatch. You must think up a particular method by which the curse can end, and if that escape hatch closes, you get to think up another one.	COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Way of Valour / True Aspect			KEY:Way of Valour ~ True Aspect			SORTKEY:Dominion_3h	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.WayOfValor		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of Valour ~ Curse					DESC:(+6 CP, requires Curse). You may spend DP to increase your powers, putting into action things you've merely been practicing. Each DP you spend (up to a limit of 3) adds 12 temporary CP for the next hour. Since this represents things you're working on, you must permanently purchase at least two-thirds of the abilities so employed within the next (one level per DP spent).

# The Path of the Pharaoh
Path of the Pharaoh / Manipulation		KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Manipulation		SORTKEY:Dominion_4a	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Dominion							DESC:(+6 CP, requires Dominion). This triples the bonuses received from the Scale basic ability.																																																																																																																																											COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Path of the Pharaoh / Sphere of Influence	KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Sphere of Influence	SORTKEY:Dominion_4b	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Manipulation		DESC:(+6 CP, requires Manipulation). You begin to embody some aspect of the universe. You gain a Divine Portfolio and automatically sense related major events. Select a relevant domain to grant to your priests. You can grant spells of up to spell level 3 while on the material plane. Increase this to level 9 if you withdraw to the outer planes, a personal astral domain, or another game-appropriate plane. Any magic cast which touches upon your Sphere of Influence costs -1 spell level for you to accomplish. Bored, retiring, or dying gods may opt to merge with one of their Spheres of Influence, becoming an eternal part of the fabric of the universe. Such gods are beyond mortal or even normal divine concerns, although they may use a point of Godfire to elevate a successor and give their remaining store to him or her on the way out.																COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Path of the Pharaoh / Godfire			KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Godfire			SORTKEY:Dominion_4c	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Sphere of Influence	DESC:(+6 CP, requires Sphere of Influence). You gain the ability to hold, manipulate, and focus Godfire. This feat opens up a whole new chapter in your power and status. You are now considered a true god, if a minor one. See Godfire (page 76, below) for more details on this wonderful ability. Like Dominion, it usually takes special circumstances to gain Godfire, such as being initiated by another god, being infused with the power of an ancient relic, having divine blood, or some mighty ritual.																																																																								COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Path of the Pharaoh / Divine Attribute	KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Divine Attribute	SORTKEY:Dominion_4d	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Godfire			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Godfire). You can temporarily embody a Sphere of Influence you possess. This causes you to lose control of your character; the GM takes over, while you become a force of nature, freely wielding the powers of one of your Spheres of Influence. This often makes you unkillable ("How can you kill the Sea?") and grants a wide range of powers which need little game description: they either are appropriate to what needs to be done or they aren't. This may well result in you attacking or hindering the party, or even eliminating your own home, friends, or magic items. Be cautious.																																																								COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Path of the Pharaoh / Transcendence		KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Transcendence		SORTKEY:Dominion_4e	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Godfire			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Godfire).

Path of the Pharaoh / Minions			KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Minions			SORTKEY:Dominion_4f	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Godfire			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Godfire). You gain 2d12 supernatural followers, outside of any Leadership feats you have. These followers are competent administrators and have challenge ratings of 2/3'rds your level. Aside from this, you gain a small horde of messenger spirits or other minor helpers, useless in combat but very useful for organizing and directing your followers. While reasonably bright, they aren't powerful at all.																																																																																					COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Path of the Pharaoh / Gateway			KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Gateway			SORTKEY:Dominion_4g	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Godfire			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Godfire). You may open a Gate to summon your minions through or travel to a known location. You may use this ability (Con Mod)+1 times per day.

Path of the Pharaoh / Creation		KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Creation			SORTKEY:Dominion_4h	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Godfire			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Godfire). You have created a permanent divine realm (and presumably an afterlife) for yourself and your followers. Once you reach this level, pretty much everyone accepts you a deity, with all the good and bad that entails.																																																																																																																			COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Path of the Pharaoh / Divine Infusion	KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Divine Infusion		SORTKEY:Dominion_4i	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Creation			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Creation). Every level after taking this ability, you gain a number of CP equal to your (Cha Mod). This is good. However, the Game Master allocates these points to conform to your followers' beliefs, tales, and ideas about you. While rarely a bad thing overall, the character often gets points in abilities he or she doesn't use or has little interest in, general attribute enhancements, strange relics, and weird minions. Much of it is likely to wind up in Endowment, below.																																																																									COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Path of the Pharaoh / Soulshield		KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Soulshield		SORTKEY:Dominion_4j	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Godfire			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Godfire). Soulshield protects your followers after they die. In other words, when one of them dies, their soul is automatically drawn to your divine realm. It cannot be trapped or held on the material plane or by a spell of less than 9th level. Any creature, item, or spell that does so is immediately brought your attention, so that you may rip the offender into tiny pieces for having the effrontery to insult you so.

Path of the Pharaoh / Sanctify		KEY:Path of the Pharaoh ~ Sanctify			SORTKEY:Dominion_4k	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.Dominion.PathOfThePharaoh	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Path of the Pharaoh ~ Soulshield			DESC:(+6 CP, requires Soulshield). Select an nonattack area-effect spell of up to 6th level. You may use that effect at will and may set it as a constant effect over your chosen holy city, in all temples dedicated to you, or on another suitably limited set of locations as you prefer. Such sites are automatically Hallowed or Unhallowed as appropriate as well.																																																																																															COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.75

Pulse summons magical energy from the area, but is limited to 1 spell level per round. It grants no ability to store such energy on its own. For another +12 CP the character can summon two spell level's worth of energy, and for +24 more CP (42 total) he or she can summon up three per round. This is the limit of the process; beyond this point the magic begins to discharge at random.

With Heart of the Dragon, the character may use the Shaping feat for higher-level spells. The basic feat allows the character to use all level 0 spells as desired, although those with cumulative effects, such as Cure Minor Wounds, lose potency after 2d6 applications to any one creature in a day. Using cantrips in this manner requires no external magical energy. For +12 CP, the character can cast level 1 spells, but this suffers from the same usage restrictions and requires that character have a level 1 spell available to substitute, or another method of gathering the energy (Pulse of the Dragon combined with Eye of the Dragon works nicely). The cost doubles for every spell level thereafter: for a further +24 CP, the character can use level 2 spells, then he or she would pay another +48 CP for level 3, +96 for level four, and so on.

Once the power of the Dragon enters the Blood, the character becomes a living source of magic. The character can expend up to (Cha Mod) spell levels each minute on Dragonfire, Breath of the Dragon, and Shaping effects without personal cost and without drawing on any other source of magic. The character also becomes a valuable resource for other spellcasters, enchanters, and anyone else who could use a powerful source of magic - or some pieces therefrom.

A mainstay of minor telekinetic talents, this allows the user to manipulate objects within 60 feet with an effective Strength of (Int/3).

Characters with Mind Over Matter may spend spell levels as needed to resist special attacks, even during other character's turns. They may sacrifice 2 spell levels per Negative Level, 1 spell level per point of attribute drain, or 3 spell levels against Paralysis. GM's may allow other, similar attacks to be resisted and set their own prices.

A favored trick in Superhero universes, Might enables characters to add their Int Bonus to their Strength score (not Strength Bonus). Some GM's may opt to allow character to pretend their Int mod is positive if it's negative for the purposes of this feat only and only when the user is in a berserker rage. We don't really recommend this, but who are we to resist the power of a stereotype?

Using subliminal telepathy, a user of the Tongue enjoys enhanced persuasive powers and may insert thoughts into people's minds. This increases any Charisma-based skill check by +2, allows the user to say one thing and pass a hidden message to one particular target, lets the user make ideas occur to people (this is no more persuasive than whispering it to them, but they'll have a hard time distinguishing such an idea from a passing thought of their own), and allows the character to use Suggestion a number of times per day equal to his or her Cha Mod.

This "receptive telepathy" helps people sense other's feelings. This grants a +4 bonus on Sense Motive, a continuous Detect Thoughts effect, and allows the user to reach into the minds of weak NPC's (in game terms, anyone with 1/5th or fewer of the character's levels) and search for information without making a roll.

With Ears of the Wind, the user may hear a snippet of conversation every time he or she is mentioned anywhere in the plane. The user can turn this ability off.

Glamour is a sort of illusion magic. It alters how people interpret what they see, but not the physical nature of it. It can make a just plain ugly person look roughly distinguished or a poorly-dressed person seem fashionably apathetic about fashion (in the way only the super-rich might be able to get away with). There is no save; the user simply gets to describe him- or herself, and those in a 15-foot radius, in his or her own words.

Way of the Dragon's Speech / Awe of the Dragon		KEY:Way of the Dragon's Speech ~ Awe of the Dragon		SORTKEY:Path of the Dragon_2l		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PathoftheDragon.WayofDragonsSpeech		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Way of the Dragon's Speech ~ Glamour							DESC:(+6 CP, requires Glamour). Awe of the Dragon allows a character to project emotions or feelings across an area. This can increase or decrease any appropriate attribute or statistics (such as BAB, Caster Level, AC) by +2, and may have other effects, such as swaying crowds or inciting riots. Normally, this is not selective and affects a 100' radius. Common examples include- Rage, +2 Strength; Calm, +2 Will save; Fear, -2 Will save (and may frighten weaker characters); and Love, additional +2 when using "Aid Another." A Will save at a DC of (10 + Level/3 + Cha Mod) will negate the effects.

A character with Voice of the Dragon gains enormous telepathic "volume." He or she may- Project the Awe of the Dragon over a 1000 foot radius. Project the Awe to another location he or she can see or scry. Even characters not sensitive to psychic or magic powers will sense this anywhere close to the area. Attempt to Stun (for 1d4 rounds), Fascinate, or Panic those affected by the base radius of the Awe. Attempt to disrupt any other character's mindaffecting abilities affecting those within the base radius of the Awe. This allows affected characters to make a new saving throw. Attempt to Stun, Fascinate, Panic, or free from mind affecting effects, any one target within line of sight range. A Will save at a DC of (10 + Level/3 + Cha Mod) will negate these effects.																																																																																							COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.95

With Manufacture, a character can speed up item creation by a factor of ten.

Occult Ritual	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.EclipseAbilityOutput.Ritual Magic	DESC:Occult Ritual (6 CP) is the art of causing singular mystic events through Spellcraft and ceremony. Describe the effect you want to produce; the Game Master thenassigns a base DC. You may then consult with the Game Master and describe the ritual and up to seven components thereof. Each of the eight ritual elements (the description and the components) is worth a bonus ofup to +5 (as assigned by the Game Master) on the ritual's Spellcraft roll. Unfortunately, rituals are much less cut-and-dried than spells. They can succeed and fail in varying degrees, and often produce unfortunate side effects. As arough guide to the DC of any given ritual, figure it at DC (10 + twice the level of the character who would be required to do it normally). The Description may contain spells to cast, entities to call upon, a specific time and/or place of power where the ritual must take place, and various mundane requirements (assistants, props, expenses, ornaments, clothing, languages to chant in, mystic diagrams, XP costs, and so on). The value of the ritual Components depends on their relevance to the rite, innate power, and scarcity. For example, the legendary Staff of the Wind Lords provides a +5 bonus when used in a ritual to raise a hurricane to devastate an enemy fleet, but aids little in attempting to awaken a volcano.

Spell Storing						KEY:Spell Storing ~ Eclipse					SORTKEY:Spell Storing_1a	OUTPUTNAME:Spell Storing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.EclipseAbilityOutput.SpellStoring.ItemCreation															DESC:(6 CP). You may store one-use spells activated by spell completion in some type of inanimate object chosen when this ability is gained. Common types include powders, scrolls, gems, bones, wands, staves, and knots. Doing so costs (Spell Level x Caster Level) x (12.5 GP and 1 XP) plus any special costs of the spell in question. L0 Spells count as level '=' for this calculation. The minimum Caster Level is whatever allows the user to cast the spell. On the market, such items have a base sale price equal to the base cost plus 5 GP per XP invested plus any special costs of the spell. Classically, scrolls are the most common form in which spells are stored. Especially awkward and bulkymedia reduce the cost by one-third. Immobile media, such as stone circles, reduce the base cost by one-half - although few characters specialize in such media to start with. Upgrades cost +3 CP each and must be taken in sequence. Sadly many of them make spells more expensive to store. Unlike most multipliers, cost multipliers for spell storing upgrades are directly cumulative. Using a x2 and a x5 multiplier on a single item results in 10x the base cost, not 6x. Similarly, if more than one upgrade that limits the level of spell which can be stored is applied, the most restrictive limit takes precedence. Characters may freely mix and match all their upgrades.

Witchcraft / The Adamant Will		KEY:Witchcraft ~ The Adamant Will		SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1c	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities			VISIBLE:YES																									DESC:This talent allows users to spend 2 Power to resist Fear, Possession, Charm, Hold effects, and other forms of mind control. The user may spend the Power each time he or she is affected by such an ability. Ongoing powers, such as Fear auras, are resisted for 10 rounds. The user may make an extra save against mindreading or "truth" effects by spending a like amount, and may present a false aura to detection spells or ignore pain for 3 power. He or she may pay the Power without spending an action when the effect takes hold.																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Dreamfaring		KEY:Witchcraft ~ Dreamfaring			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1d	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:Dreamfaring allows users to enter a trance and project their spirits into the Ethereal and near Astral planes. They may detect and communicate with beings in nearby dimensions without paying power. For 2 Power they may enter the dreams of others to torment or communicate with them wherever they may be, possibly causing them to lose sleep or worse. Traveling about costs 3 Power plus 1 for every three hours and allows for covert meetings with other Witches or for clairvoyance-like effects via astral or ethereal spying.																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Elfshot			KEY:Witchcraft ~ Elfshot			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1e	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:Elfshot allows the user to lay minor curses. Such curses may reduce an attribute by -2, cause some type of misfortune, penalize a group of checks by -6, hinder activity, induce sterility or miscarriages, and so on. Classic examples include causing cows to go dry, mules and horses to bolt, and pets to bite their owners. Such curses are generally either instant or last until they are countered. Lesser diseases may also be inflicted in this fashion. Curses usually cost 1 Power for quick effects, 2 for lingering curses, and 3 for permanent ones. The Remove Curse spell, or any effect which eliminates the symptoms or curse directly, heals the mystical injury.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Glamour			KEY:Witchcraft ~ Glamour			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1f	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:This projective telepathy works much like the Path of the Dragon ability of the same name. It grants a +6 bonus on relevant social skills (1 Power per 10 minutes), the sending of brief messages, emotional influence and hypnotic effects (approximate relevant L0 or L1 spells for 1 or 2 Power respectively). Glamour is at its best combined with Disguise skill and Shadoweave to alter how people see the user. It's often used with the Inner Eye, below, to allow rapid communications, teaching, and mental probes.	DESC:For +6 CP the user may expand his or her repertoire to level 2 (2 power) and 3 (4 power) hypnotic and emotion influencing effects (compare to the Sorcerer/Wizard list).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft ~ Glamour ~ Advanced																		SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / The Hand of Shadows	KEY:Witchcraft ~ The Hand of Shadows	SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1g	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:The Hand of Shadows covers basic telekinesis. Minor tricks (like bending spoons) cost no power. Exerting a force equal to what you could physically handle costs 1 Power per minute. Light but rapid work (like sorting wheat from chaff) costs 1 Power per hour's worth of work done. Minor animations (Entangle, Animate Rope) approximate the relevant spells at a cost of 2 power, +2 if excessive force or fine control is required.																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Healing			KEY:Witchcraft ~ Healing			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1h	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:This accomplishes a full day's worth of healing in a mere hour at a cost of 1 Power and grants a +5 bonus on any relevant checks (against disease or toxins). This is also used to throw off the effects of drugs and intoxicants with a flat duration. In emergencies, Witches may simply heal 1d4 hit points per Power spent up to a maximum of 3d4 hit points per round.																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Hyloka			KEY:Witchcraft ~ Hyloka				SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1i	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:The manipulation of biophysical processes is a rare gift. This can be used to briefly move physical attribute points around (up to 6 points for 1 Power per hour), slip into hibernation (1 power; lasts up to a week), help resist heat or cold (1 Power per hour, this grants 5 points of fire or cold resistance), stop bleeding, delay poison (one hour per power), grow hair or make it fall out (1 power), and to inflict or ease ailments like arthritis (spend 1 power/week to inflict, 1 power/day to ease).																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Infliction			KEY:Witchcraft ~ Infliction			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1j	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:Often manifested as phantom force-claws, heart attacks, inexplicable bleeding, and agonizing pain, Infliction causes injury through psychic force. This can include spectacular attacks - throwing fiery balls or thunderbolts or such - but is usually subtle. In any case, it deals 1d4 hit points of damage per character level, to a maximum of 3/5/7 d4 damage for 1/2/3 power. Targets may make a save for half damage, but the save used depends on the form of the attack. Infliction normally affects a single target, but may be expanded to a fivefoot radius for +3 power.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / The Inner Eye		KEY:Witchcraft ~ The Inner Eye		SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1k	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:Thought-sensing can be used to see surface thoughts, to detect the presence of a hidden being, to share a target's senses, or to read any psychic impressions left behind on an object by strong emotion. This provides a +6 on any relevant Spot, Sense Motive, or Listen checks for 1 Power per 10 minutes.																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Shadowweave		KEY:Witchcraft ~ Shadowweave			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1l	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:Shadowweave manipulates light and darkness to craft minor illusions. Normally 1 Power grants 10 minutes of activity. Effects include will-o-the wisps, cloaking (+6 to stealth and disguise rolls), various apparitions, spheres of darkness, blinding rays of light and hiding small actions - such as slipping out a dagger, picking a pocket, or a strike in combat (offers a +3 circumstance bonus to the user's roll).	DESC:For +6 CP the user may expand his or her repertoire to level 2 (2 power) and 3 (4 power) illusion-casting effects (compare to the Sorcerer/Wizard list).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft ~ Shadowweave ~ Advanced																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Witchfire			KEY:Witchcraft ~ Witchfire			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1m	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:Molecular-level telekinesis. At its simplest this can create and manipulate heat or cold (1d8/3d6 damage for 1/2 power, +1 if affecting a modest area, -1 if using pre-existing flame), create effects on the "prestidigitation" level (1 Power per turn), extract essences from herbs, and infuse drugs and toxins into objects. Talented Witches sometimes use this for creating mysterious sounds and voices.																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Witchcraft / Witchsight			KEY:Witchcraft ~ Witchsight			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_1n	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAbilities																													DESC:Sharpening or expanding the user's senses is a simple trick. In general, this affects one sense at a time, providing either a +6 bonus on relevant checks or some special capability (Darksight, Scent, etc). As a rule this costs 1 Power and lasts for about an hour. Witches may triple the effect by reducing the duration to a single round, allowing effects such as checking a meal for poison with the slightest taste.

For an additional 2, this location has whatever furniture or scenery the user wishes, though it is all merely illusion except to astral forms.

This technique allows one to build up a basic Witchcraft ability over up to 28 days. The Witch uses the powers, but delays the effect, which becomes cumulative based on the Power spent. The target must be reasonably accessible the entire time. At its upper limit, the user can bring down castle walls or stone bridges with Hand of the Shadows, or use Elfshot to lay a massive and terrifying curse. Master of the Sabbat has great potential, but the Witch must hang around the target for days on end.

Path of Coven Mastery / Master the Elements	KEY:The Path of Coven Mastery ~ Master the Elements	SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4e	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:The Witch may enter a trance and travel the spirit realms to seek out a particular spirit and either request a favor or do battle. For example, when confronted with a severe drought a Witch could either seek out and battle/defeat in a contest/appease/ negotiate with/command the Drought Spirit responsible, attempt to get a Rain Spirit to bring rain, or seek a patron's advice on how to deal with the situation. Such advice may range from the eminently practical ~ "build a dam across the stream and irrigate"] on through the utterly mystical ~ "when mourns the tribe with the mother of thunder, the skies too shall weep"]. Either way, this allows the user to personify abstract problems. Regardless of how long a quest appears to the Witch, it actually requires [1d8x1d8] hours. It generally takes a fair amount of time to prepare for another such quest after the first one is complete, hence a character cannot undertake more than ~ Cha Mod spirit quests per month.

Path of Coven Mastery / Summoning			KEY:The Path of Coven Mastery ~ Summoning			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4g	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:Summoning allows Witches to channel their powers into other planes. While this is commonly used with Glamour and The Inner Eye to contact patrons and potential patrons, with Infliction to assault troublesome entities, or with Spirit Binding to try and control spirits, many other abilities can be used in conjunction with it. Opening a link over which to use you powers costs 3 power, opening the way for a spirit to come through costs 7 or more. A Witch can attempt to reach any being he or she knows the name of ~ or, in some settings, the true name of, including the deceased. This can bring a spirit of the dead or an extra-planar creature into the world. While Witches can't bring forth bodies ~ and must procure a "vacant" one or bind a construct with Spirit Binding, below, if the entity wants or needs one they can still summon a spirit for 7 Power. Note that this ability grants no power to control or compel the spirit in question, but merely brings it forth. If a Witch wants to control a spirit he or she will have to use other means. As a side benefit, various entities may be willing to lend the Witch some extra magic, usually ~ Witch's Cha Mod +3 spell levels worth of any spells or spell-like abilities they possess of up to spell level 3. The bargains the user needs to make obtain this are entirely up to the GM and the type of creature she's contacting. Patrons are more forgiving. They'll provide those spell levels up to ~ Cha Mod times before requiring payment, assuming the character uses them to advance the Patron's interests. Entities may either imbue the Witch with specific spells at the cost of 7 Power at the time of imbuement or have the user contact them when they need the magic at the cost of 3 Power and two Standard Actions; one to make the contact and request an effect, and one to activate it. While this is far more flexible, it's also far more difficult to use in a fight. No, characters do not get retroactive spell levels if they later increase their Charisma and item, equipment, magical, or psionically-based bonuses do not count. You cannot repeatedly put on and remove a Charisma boosting item to get infinite magic this way.																																									COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.115

# The Path of Spirits
Path of Spirits / Seize the Wandering Soul	KEY:The Path of Spirits ~ Seize the Wandering Soul	SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4h	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:This vicious ability allows the user to kidnap a wandering spirit for 3 Power, plus 1 per 3 hours it is held. While primarily useful against the very recently dead, it is an effective attack against incorporeal undead, very sick individuals, dreamers having out-of-body experiences, and non-physical astraltravelers. A living character with fewer than 1/5th of his or her total hit points is vulnerable, and if so trapped must make an additional Fort saving throw or die. If they succeed, their body remains comatose for the duration, or until it starves. Spells to protect corpses preserve it undamaged, as does expert medical care. Astral travelers, spirits and dreamers don't need to make saving throws to survive - they're already disconnected. Unless they possess a special technique usable while without a body ~ usually including Test of Wills, Witchcraft, and Thaumaturgy a spirit so trapped is helpless. The Witch may telepathically communicate with it at will, and enjoys a +6 bonus on any Intimidate checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.116
Path of Spirits / Hag-Riding				KEY:The Path of Spirits ~ Hag-Riding			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4i	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:Witches don't like spending Power. They still like magic, so some develop the ability to steal Power from other people. This special form of Body Fuel draws Power from a willing victim or from a bound or captured spirit. The Witch may inflict temporary up to 12 points of attribute damage on the victim per day, although no attribute can be decreased below 6 in this manner. Each stolen attribute point provides 1 Power for the Witch. According to classic, if sensationalist, literature, Witches would seize a sleeping victims spirit ~ Seize the Wandering Soul for 3 Power then ride it, figuratively or not, to the Coven and back ~ 2 Power for holding the trapped spirit for six hours and 4 for the astral trip, leaving 6 points to spend on other magic - at a net cost of only 3 points of their own power. A Witch with a lot of bound spirits to draw on may have a great deal of Power in reserve. Of course, a Witch who makes a hobby of imprisoning spirits is likely to attract a lot of opposition - and that reserve doesn't recover very quickly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				COST:6	SOURCEPAGE:p.116
Path of Spirits / Spirit Binding			KEY:The Path of Spirits ~ Spirit Binding			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4j	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:Spirit Binding allows a Witch to entrap spirits in objects ~ including constructs, areas, or nonsentient animals permanently, or at least until whatever was used is destroyed, slain, or exorcized. First, the Witch must have another ability to get a spirit, either by using Seize the Wandering Soul, having a friendly incorporeal creature, or using Summoning. He or she may then put the spirit in a living but presumably animal or soul-less body for 5 Power or anchor it in an inanimate object or area for 7. The spirit gains control of living or animated bodies, although ones stuck in the form of a lantern or duck likely won't be doing much of use. The spirit's mental attributes remain the same. Lesser bindings cost 3 Power, and include forbidding certain actions, the classic "love spell," and other compulsions roughly equivalent to a Lesser Geas. As a secondary effect, the Witch may seal a bargain for 1 Power, so that neither party can willingly violate it. A save applies only if one or both parties is acting under duress. The Witch will know if either party attempts to save - and whether or not they succeed. For +6 CP the user may attempt to simply command a creature to undertake some simple, and relatively safe, action. If the target fails to save it continues to follow directions for up to ten minutes per level of the user. Typical commands include leaving the area, surrendering, renouncing possession of someone else's body, paying no attention to the user, answering some questions, or returning home. It costs 3 Power to target a normal creature, but 5 for spirits, outsiders, and magical beings such as dragons ~ they're virtually certain to successfully resist anyway. In some worlds inanimate objects have their own spirits, even if they don't usually pay any attention to mortals. If this is true in your world, Witches with this ability may attempt to command inanimate objects ~ as per Animate Object for 7 Power.

Path of Spirits / Apparition				KEY:The Path of Spirits ~ Apparition			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4l	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:Apparition allows the Witch to manifest a semi-tangible body on the material plane while using Dreamfaring. Such forms are equal to an Astral Construct IV, and while shadowy, appear in whatever shape the Witch desires. The destruction of this form forces the Witch to make a Fort save against his or her own magic or take 1d4 temporary Con damage and 2d6 normal damage ~ the wound corresponds to the "killing" blow on the construct, allowing alert investigators to note the connection between the apparition and the Witch. This costs 2 Power plus 1 per hour. The user may spend another 6 CP to upgrade to an Astral Construct V, and an additional 6 for Astral Construct VI.

Path of Spirits / Ridden by the Loa			KEY:The Path of Spirits ~ Ridden by the Loa		SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4m	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft										DEFINE:RidenByLoaCount|0	DESC:This ability allows Witches to temporarily gain the benefits of an appropriate Template, with built-in downsides. It may grant a Template of up to +4 ECL and costs 1 Power per hour. Any attribute change from the Template does not affect the character's Power pool. The Witch may also change his or her Template simply by reusing this ability. The GM decides what "appropriate" is according to the game world. Unlike normal Templates, however, the character is actually possessed. The character's basic goals remain intact, but the spirit ~ of a type related to the Template is mostly in control and does as it pleases. By spending an additional 6 CP on this ability, the character becomes an equal partner, but the spirit is still able to control much of the affected character's actions. For a further 6 CP, the character becomes firmly in control. The spirit still has the strength to do minor acts and can keep the character from doing things it doesn't like. Game masters who don't mind improvising may allow characters to host a wide variety of spirits, such as "the spirit of the forest" or "the spirit of darkness." This usually means gaining access to various supernatural abilities and some extra hit points. Sadly, unique spirits cannot be reduced to less than "equal partners" ~ gods are always "mostly in control," but almost never allow this sort of thing anyway. The Witch usually has no idea what powers such a spirit may have anyway.	DESC: &nl;The character is possessed.

Path of Spirits / Siphon				KEY:The Path of Spirits ~ Siphon				SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4n	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:Siphon allows the Witch to bargain with spirits for a reflexive powers - continuous links which don't need to be invoked before each use. For example, the Witch could borrow a fire spirit's elemental attack or resistance. There are problems with this ability of course. First and foremost, the Witch must actually find and bargain with the relevant spirit - meaning the GM has final say over any deal ~ they're usually for a limited time, expensive, may or may not cost Power, and restrict how the granted power or powers may be used. The Witch must also spend actions to use the power. Purely defensive powers use Immediate Actions, while offensive ones are Move-Equivalent Actions. Finally, while Witches may bargain with many spirits, they can only have one link active at a time.

Path of Spirits / Possession				KEY:The Path of Spirits ~ Possession			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4o	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:The master of Possession may project him- or herself into another's person's body to seize control. The Witch's body remains in a deep trance for the duration. The initial attempt costs 3 Power, plus 1 Power per hour the effect is maintained. This Power only works on living creatures roughly like the Witch's own species. Another +6 CP eliminates the maintenance cost and +6 CP more allows the character to abandon his or her own body and eject the old character's soul ~ either simply sending it on to the afterlife or forcing it into their old body with Spirit Binding.

Path of Darkness / Web of Shadows			KEY:The Path of Darkness ~ Web of Shadows			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_4p	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:Some Witches devote their magic to gaining mundane influence, spinning a Web of Shadows. This allows the character to gain influence in a region or city and support a network of minions or like-minded individuals. Normally evil, subversive, or criminal, these groups always have something to hide and something to hide from. The Witch has general connections with the underworld and may specify 2d4 + ~ Cha Mod specific contacts, though the GM can veto any with unbalancing power or utility. Theoretically there's no reason why a good or neutral Witch can't take this to set up an "underground railroad" or group of revolutionaries, found a secretive church or guild, or otherwise put together a conspiracy. It's just that darkness magic always seems to work better for the bad guys.

# The Path of Water
Path of Water / Brewing					KEY:The Path of Water ~ Brewing				SORTKEY:Witchcraft_5a	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:The fine art of herbs, poisons, narcotics, and other drugs comes into full bloom with this discipline. In general, preparing a brew requires a selection of herbs and 1d4+1 days. This can be reduced to 1d4+1 hours for 2 power. Brews usually remain potent for 1d6 weeks. If a dose is more than a week old roll when it's taken to see if it's still potent. Using Witchfire can reduce the preparation time to 1d4+1 minutes at the cost of 5 additional power. Enhancers boost one of the user's abilities by 1d4+2 for one hour, after which the user becomes Fatigued. Power brews grant 2d4+2 extra Power. Sadly, they're prone to side effects, which continue to apply even if the brew has lost potency otherwise. Roll 1d6 when one is taken; ~ 1-3 no side effect, ~ 4 user cannot regain Power naturally for 2 days, ~ 5 the user takes 1d4 damage to a random attribute, ~ 6 the user's Power drops to zero after an hour and must be recovered normally. Poisons can be prepared whenever the appropriate ingredients are available. Lesser poisons can be prepared at any time, but must be ingested or inhaled and take hours to take effect. Oddly enough, poisons often remain potent for considerable periods, so roll for months instead of weeks. Antidotes can be prepared in only 1d4+1 rounds at the cost of 5 power. They grant a second saving throw versus poisons, intoxicants, and other compounds with a +6 alchemical bonus. The creator must specify the poison to be affected when making the brew, although "the one affecting him!" is sufficient when the Witch needs an immediate cure. Dream Ointment reduces the cost for Dreamfaring by 2 Power and induces uncontrolled astral projection in those without that discipline. This is very dangerous. Aside from these major uses, Witches can brew many useful potions and drugs to cause hallucinations, treat or cause illness, cause minor magical effects ~ such as blemish removal, minor alterations to facial features, and similar herbal magic effects, ease pain, and induce sleep.

Path of Water / Spirits of the Deep			KEY:The Path of Water ~ Spirits of the Deep		SORTKEY:Witchcraft_5e	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:A Witch using Spirits of the Deep infuses the target with wild, celestial, or infernal energy, depending on the target's own nature, not the Witch's desires. This means the GM gets to decide what Template to apply to the target and what influence it has on his or her behavior. It is otherwise similar to Ridden by the Loa. This commonly grants the target the Celestial or Fiendish Template, or induces Lycanthropy, but other results are possible. While the first two are generally useful to the subject, Lycanthropy is considered a major curse by most people. This costs 7 Power. For +3 CP the user may imprint a mass of elemental energy with a bit of his or her consciousness, creating a minor elemental servant ~ equivalent to a Mephit for 4 power. For +3 additional CP the user can make servants equivalent to medium-sized Elementals.

Hair, nail clippings, dried bloodstains, or family heirlooms are all common links, though for inanimate targets a small piece of their structure will do. Poor links, such as mere scrapings of blood or an old, forgotten piece of clothing grant the target a +5 bonus on their saving throw. A link may only be used 1d4+1 times before the sympathy is exhausted. Exceptionally good links, such as a piece of a child's placenta or fresh blood, are good for 2d4+2 uses and increase the DC of resisting by 3.

Delaying the poison's effect for hours or days costs +1 or +2 Power, respectively.

The simplest technique knits bone and sinew together more strongly, adding 6d4 temporary hit points for 4 Power. Unfortunately, these may not be renewed until the duration runs out. The Iron Fist variant allows the user to treat his or her fists as maces, through which he or she may also channel Infliction as a Free Action when he or she strikes an enemy once per round. This costs 2 Power. The Iron Skin variant allows the user to gain +4 Natural Armor for 1 Power. The Iron Lung variant suspends the user's metabolism, briefly eliminating the user's need to breathe, stopping any poisons or bleeding, and making the Witch impervious to pain. This increases Fort saves by +4. The Iron Flesh technique provides a +2 enhancement bonus to the users Str and Con for 2 Power. All these effects last for 10 minutes and are notcumulative with themselves.

With this ability the Witch can upgrade the Affliction ability to cause d8's of damage instead of d4's, for +1 Power. An enemy killed by this dies in a spectacular fashion, such as rotting instantly, burning away into ash, or melting into goo. The Witch may also use a Paralyze attack ~ target must save or be Paralyzed for 1d4 rounds/hours/days/decades for 3/6/9/12 Power, instantly rot away or render useless inanimate organic material ~ 10 cubic feet per point of power, often used to dispose of bodies or sabotage food supplies, and inflict horrific diseases ~ as per Contagion, for 3 power. While tales persist of Witches with the power to kill with a glance, most Witches regard them as mere legend.

Diseases, poisons, and parasites all fail to affect him or her during this period. The user can survive wounds up to and including total dismemberment, so long as someone puts him or her back together eventually and uses some healing magic to seal over the wounds. This costs 3 Power to induce. Alternatively, the Witch may use a healing trance to gain a full day's healing in one hour, and purge any poisons, parasites, or diseases from his or her body.

True Prosperity allows them to enhance the fertility of a wide area, such as the fields of an entire village. Moreover, this effect is selective, allowing the Witch to exclude weeds, focus on just horses, or hinder disease. Some evil Witches use this ability to enhance the virulence of diseases and plagues, induce birth defects, and otherwise spread desolation. When combined with Covenbond, it can affect an entire city or forest.

Path of Fire / Ashen Rebirth				KEY:The Path of Fire ~ Ashen Rebirth			SORTKEY:Witchcraft_5r	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paths.WitchcraftOutput.WitchcraftAdvancedAbilities	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witchcraft															DESC:In using the magic of fire, some rare Witches discover the ability to transform themselves into beings of pure energy. The user gains DR 10/- and Fire Resistance 10, along with flight ~ 30' per round, a minor fire energy touch attack at 2d6 + ~ Dex Mod with a rangeof 20 feet, and is considered intangible. This costs 1 Power per minute. Characters who keep this effect active for more than 1 minute place their forms under considerable strain. The character becomes fatigued. After 2 minutes, he or she becomes exhausted. After 3 minutes, he or she begins taking 1d4 damage per round. Rumors whisper that a few Witches have found ways to transform permanently. If these are true, it could probably be done by managing to keep the effect going ~ without dying for several hours. For +3 CP the user gains the ability to "jump" from point to point while in energy form by spending 2 Power. This requires an open path, however crooked, between the starting and ending points but is otherwise equivalent to Dimension Door. For an additional +3 CP and 7 Power this becomes equivalent to Teleportation. Variants for other energy types are quite acceptable. It's the transformation which makes it a fire discipline.

This can override paralysis or agony for 2 Power, or suspend the need to eat or drink for up a week by spending 2 Power per day. A character with appalling injuries, such as a sucking chest wound or with his or her heart ripped out, can survive for a time by spending 2 Power per 10 points of damage beyond what they could normally endure, though this lasts only 10 minutes per Power spent. As a side benefit, they can automatically resist poisons and drugs while their metabolisms are shut down ~ although they will take effect later and can pretend to be dead quite effectively by shutting down their pulse, respiration, and production of body heat.

This means the user may add a Move-Equivalent Action in any given round by spending 2 Power or gain a +4 bonus to Initiative for the same price. For 3 Power they may Haste themselves for 3d4 rounds. On a lesser level, it can induce rapid healing, allowing the user to heal 1d4 + ~ Con Mod hit points per round for 5 rounds for 1 Power.

Used passively, this grants a +2 bonus on any saving throw against an energy effect for 1 Power per use. Used actively, the Witch may be able to drain machinery, extinguish fires, or neutralize radiation. The exact cost of active use varies, but normally 1-2 points for minor effects, 3-4 for major ones, or 5-6 for great effects. Usually cutting off a normal fire costs 1, draining an electrical device 3, and canceling a Fire Wall spell 5.

This may seem powerful, and it is, but the magic comes with a vicious price: attempting to use this ability on magic beyond the character's control leads to nasty side effects. The user must choose a specific type of magic ~ e.g., Druidic, Sorcery, Wizardry and a source of spells ~ e.g., a bargain with a Nature spirit, an infusion of blood from a demon, a tome of ancient spells. The GM, of course, must let him or her get away with it. The user gains access to six spells of each level he or she can now cast. The Caster Level equals only half the character's level. The maximum level of spell which he or she may cast safely is equal to his or her level/4, rounded down. Attempts to exceed this require a Will save at a DC of ~ 12 + the number of levels until the spell could safely be cast. If the user succeeds, the spell goes off, but a failure on the check means that the caster must refer to the table below.

A reading costs 1 Power, and may sometimes give the Witch a vague idea of whether the future holds danger or peace ~ i.e., which one the GM has planned today. Using clairsentience costs 3 Power unless it is being used on very close things ~ like listening accurately through a wall, in which case it costs 1 Power.

If relevant to the task at hand - such as in piloting a ship through a hurricane - this provides a +5 bonus for 1 Power. On an active level, the user can attempt to raise winds. Unfortunately, while a gust of wind will work almost anywhere, there has to be an ongoing electrical storm before one can channel lightning effects. Raising a gust of wind costs 1-3 Power depending on the strength of the gust desired ~ 1 will blow out torches or supply a cooling breeze for a while, 2 can provide wind for a ship for a few minutes or sweep someone off their feet - while 3 can produce a hurricane strength gust equal to a Wind Wall spell. Users may channel existing storms into creating snow, rain, sleet, or lightning. This costs 2 Power. Lightning effects deal damage as per Infliction, but with a maximum range of the entire storm region.

This deals 3d8 damage and forces a creature to save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Neutral creatures can be stunned with this, but not injured, and even good ones can be momentarily blinded. This costs 2 Power. On a less combative level, this dispels darkness and illusion effects up to 2/3 of the character's level ~ if the target spell's caster fails the save and reveals the true forms of shapeshifters.

A quick ward can be used by adventuring Witches or those in a fight to grant a +2 bonus to saving throws, AC, and attack rolls against devils, demons, undead, and any other creature the GM feels fits the definition of "evil entity." This costs 5 Power, covers a 40' radius, and lasts for 1 hour. More lasting wards cost less Power but must be powered each day. These cost 2 Power, but increase the above effect to a +4 bonus.
