He may mask a second alignment trait versus alignment-based effects, as the path of darkness/ path of light ability.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.227	BENEFIT:A low templar must make a final choice of what path he chooses. He may mask a second alignment trait versus alignment-based effects, as the path of darkness/ path of light ability. A low templar can chose the path of darkness at 5th level and then choose the path of redemption at 10th level (or vice versa). When the low templar makes this choice, he gains a planar cohort appropriate to his actual alignment, even if he does not have the Leadership feat.

BONUS:VAR|PrayerAttackDC|10+classlevel("Red Mantis Assassin")+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.230	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(DC %1)|PrayerAttackDC	BENEFIT:To initiate a prayer attack the Red Mantis assassin holds her sawtooth sabre out before her, point down, and weaves the blade in the air in a circular pattern. The mantis must be within 30 feet of his victim and must be visible to her victim. While wielding a sawtooth sabre, the assassin can fascinate a victim. His victim can resist with a Will save (DC %1). By concentrating, the assassin maintain this fascination, and after 3 rounds of fascination, he may make a coup de grace attack against the target. Activating or concentrating on maintaining a prayer attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The victim may attempt a new saving throw to resist the fascination each time a potential threat (other than the fascinating assassin) approaches him. Taking damage from any source automatically breaks the victim's fascination, as can a fascinated creature's ally who takes a standard action to shake the victim free of the effects. This assassination attack is therefore most effective against foes who are alone.|PrayerAttackDC

Thousands of summoned mantises shroud the targeted creature and slice away at exposed flesh. The Red Mantis assassin rolls %1d8 per class level and compares the result to the target's current hit points. If the result equals or exceeds the target's hit points, the target dies; otherwise he takes nonlethal damage equal to the amount rolled and becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. He can negate the panic and halve the damage with a successful Reflex save (DC %2). The swarm's attack is non-magical, so spell resistance does not apply. The mantis doom's damage penetrates damage reduction as a magic and evil weapon.|classlevel("Red Mantis Assassin")|MantisDoomDC

SOURCEPAGE:p.232	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|+%1|SoddenStealthBonus		BENEFIT:Shackles pirates spend their careers studying and adapting to their unique, marshy environs. As a result, they develop skills which allow them to stealthily approach their targets even over the wettest, muddiest ground. Most wear dark green and brown clothes made of oilcloth (to repel water) and reed hats with angled brims to keep rain out of their eyes. Shackles pirates sometimes string small beads in their hair to generate a quiet susurrus as they walk. This mimics the sound of wind in the bogs and helps mask the noise of their footsteps. A Shackles pirate gains a +%1 competence bonus on Move Silently checks made in marshes, bogs, or swamps.|SoddenStealthBonus
Bogstep			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyMovement						DESC:A Shackles pirate learns how to move quickly through the treacherous terrain of her home.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.232										BENEFIT:A Shackles pirate learns how to move quickly through the treacherous terrain of her home. She moves through shallow bogs normally, and it costs her 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog. She can Tumble through shallow bogs with no penalty and can Tumble through deep bogs with a -4 penalty.

Navigate Maelstrom	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DESC:The Eye of Abendego, the hurricane that constantly rages offshore, poses a hazard to all ships moving along the Shackles coast. Shackles pirates know how to successfully navigate the gusting winds and churning water.												SOURCEPAGE:p.232										BENEFIT:The Eye of Abendego, the hurricane that constantly rages offshore, poses a hazard to all ships moving along the Shackles coast. Shackles pirates know how to successfully navigate the gusting winds and churning water. The hurricane exerts some unfathomable mystical influence over some of the pirates of the area. At 4th level, a Shackles pirate treats all storms as if they were one category less severe for purposes of sailing and navigation. She treats the Eye of Abendego as if it were a zone of inclement weather, rather than a powerful storm, for purposes of sailing and navigation.
Grapple Ship		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural									DESC:As a Shackles pirate's connection to the Eye of Abendego grows stronger, she learns to perform impossible feats.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.233										BENEFIT:As a Shackles pirate's connection to the Eye of Abendego grows stronger, she learns to perform impossible feats. A Shackles pirate gains the ability to stop another ship dead in the water for a short time. To use this ability, the Shackles pirate must hurl a grappling hook at the target ship. The pirate is proficient with the grappling hook, and she throws it with a 20-foot range increment. If the Shackles pirate hits the target ship, she then makes an opposed Strength check. She gains a +1 bonus on her check for every crewmate who also grapples the enemy ship, although crewmates are considered non-proficient with grappling hooks and throw them with 10-foot range increments. For every point by which the Shackles pirate exceeds the ship's Strength check, she halts its progress for 1 round.
Shipmind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:ShipmindRounds|0		DESC:A Shackles pirate can, once per day as a standard action, control her ship with a thought.																							BONUS:VAR|ShipmindRounds|classlevel("Shackles Pirate")	SOURCEPAGE:p.233	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1 rounds)|ShipmindRounds	BENEFIT:A Shackles pirate can, once per day as a standard action, control her ship with a thought. The Shackles pirate must be on the deck of the ship she wishes to control and she must be conscious. Once the Shackles pirate activates her shipmind, she can feel the ship as if it were an extension of her body. She can "see" from the ship anywhere she wants, and adjusting her point of view is a free action. The Shackles pirate can move the ship as if it were her own body, and it moves over water at her base move or the ship's normal speed, whichever is greater. She and her ship can move forward and backward, make right angle turns, and come to a dead stop, despite the ship's size or the weather conditions. While the Shackles pirate uses her shipmind ability, her body appears paralyzed and unresponsive. She is considered helpless and cannot defend herself, but she retains an awareness of what goes on around her body (and can see her body from her perspective on the ship if she wishes). She may end the shipmind effect as an immediate action. This ability lasts for %1 rounds.|ShipmindRounds
Fogcraft			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DESC:The Shackles pirate gains the incredible power to shape a vessel out of the fog that roils across the boggy landscape. This ability functions only in the Shackles and is usable once per day.																SOURCEPAGE:p.233										BENEFIT:The Shackles pirate gains the incredible power to shape a vessel out of the fog that roils across the boggy landscape. This ability functions only in the Shackles and is usable once per day. Forming a craft takes 10 minutes, and the craft's duration lasts for a variable number of hours depending on its size. A fogcraft appears made of swirling gray mist but feels solid to the touch. Its unique composition can make it difficult to spot, and the craft makes no sound, but it does not baff le sounds made by its crew. A fogcraft has a carrying capacity equal to an ordinary ship of its type, but its impermanence makes it a poor cargo ship. It requires the appropriate number of crewmen in order to sail. A fogcraft possesses speed and maneuverability equal to that of an ordinary ship of its type, but unlike ordinary ships, a fogcraft can move over land as easily as water. A Shackles pirate receives a +4 competence bonus on skill checks made to sail her fogcraft. When a Shackles pirate creates a fogcraft, she can chose its size from any of the options listed below. With larger ships comes a trade-off in stealth, Armor Class, and duration.
