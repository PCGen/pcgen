DESC:Do what you will, but do not interfere with trade. This is the only law of Katapesh. Under the guidance of the mysterious and alien Pactmasters, this simple rule has allowed Katapesh to become one of the wealthiest nations of the Inner Sea region, where goods, services, and creatures of all kinds are available for the right price. As the location of the Legacy of Fire Adventure Path, Katapesh is a wild land of danger and temptation, home to scheming merchants and bestial gnoll slavers--a perfect place for bold adventurers to prove themselves.
