Hi Paul,<br>
<br>
This is Michael Todd, owner of Big Finger Games. Sure, you have my permission to use Masterwork Qualities with PCGen.

<br>
Thank you for purchasing our pdf, glad to see someone is putting it to some use! Let me know if you need anything else from us.

&gt;To whom it may concern,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;My name is Paul King, and I am the Publisher Liaison Silverback for <br>
&gt;PCGen. PCGen is a character generator that won an ENnie last<br>
year.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I recently purchased your Masterwork Qualities PDF. I was wondering if <br>
&gt;PCGen can have your permission to create datasets based<br>
upon your products. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Thank you for your time.<br>
&gt;<br>
