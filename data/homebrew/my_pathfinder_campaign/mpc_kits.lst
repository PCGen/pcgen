#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Starting Kit File tags" to
#find out how the tags in the kits file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#The STARTPACK tag MUST be the FIRST line of a new kit definition. It starts creation of a new kit. All lines following this
#one are considered part of this kit until a new STARTPACK tag, or the end of the file, is encountered. It also defines the
#Kit's name.
#
#The EQUIPBUY tag sets the percentage that the total cost of all the gear in the kit is discounted (or inflated by). If set
#to 0 the gear is granted for free. EQUIPBUY must be used in lines that start with STARTPACK.
#
#The combination of PREMULT and PRERACE tags is used here to make sure that the kit can only be applied, when either no race
#has been selected yet or the race is one that can be used with this kit. There is a multitude of existing prerequiste tags
#in PCGen. If you are looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic
#"PRExxx tags".
#
#The VISIBLE tag is used to filter when the kit will be displayed in PCGen. VISIBLE must be used in lines that start with
#STARTPACK.
#
#The RACE tag selects the race for the character.
#
#The NAME tag can be used to set the name for the character.
#
#The ALIGN tag will give the character the listed alignment.
#
#The SKILL and RANK combination will set the Skill rank for the skill, as long as there are sufficient skill points in the
#skill pool and rank is within the limits for or character of the given level.
#
#The FEAT tag will add listed feat, as long as there are sufficient feat points in the feat pool.
#
#The STAT line can be used to modify the stats of a character. In the example the stats are set, so the creature will have
#the values of the default creature that you can see in the RSRD. The given stats and stat bonuses from the race entry will
#add up to give the wanted results.
#
#The GEAR tag can be used to automatically give equipment to a character. It can be stuffed with additional tags, where QTY
#can be used to give multiple items, LOCATION will equip the item at the wante d location, as long as there is still free
#space, SIZE can be used to resize the Equipment.
