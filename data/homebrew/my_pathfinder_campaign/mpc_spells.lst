#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.

#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Spell File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the spells file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#####
#Teleport is the name of the spell. It will appear in the spells list on PCGen's Spells tab and will be used if a spell is
#added by use of the SPELLS tag. Every spell must have a name.
#
#The CLASSES tag indicates that this spell is the indicated level for the named class. It will appear in most spells, unless
#the spell is for some reason not associated with a class.
#
#The DOMAINS tag indicates that this spell is the indicated level for the named domain. It is only used with spells that
#belong to a domain.
#
#The SCHOOL tag lists the Schools the spell belongs to and is used for specialist wizards to determine their favored schools
#bonus spells. It should be used if the spell belongs to a school (which almost always is the case).
#
#The SUBSCHOOL tag lists the Sub-Schools the spell belongs to and is also used for specialist wizards to determine their
#favored schools bonus spells. You can usually find it in the books in parentheses after the School. If it exists, it should
#be used.
#
#The TYPE tag indicates what "types" are associated with the spell. Every spell should have it.
#
#COMPS, CASTTIME, RANGE, TARGETAREA, DURATION, SAVEINFO, SPELLRES, and DESC are the tags that actually describe the spell.
#Most if not all of them will be used in every spell.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the spell. This will be displayed in PCGen and on
#the output sheet.
#
#The ITEM tag tells PCGen what types of items this spell can be used to make (Potions, wands, wondrous items, etc).
