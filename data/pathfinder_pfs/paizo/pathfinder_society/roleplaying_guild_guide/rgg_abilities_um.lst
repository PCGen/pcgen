# According to RGG version 8, pp 8, "Feats and Traits" if a feat's prerequisites have changed, a PC may switch to the updated feat, ignoring the prerequisites or keep the feat or or retrain it at no cost.
# One such feat issue is that "Improved Two-Weapon Feint" didn't originionally require "Two-Weapon Feint" as a prerequisite.
