Roleplaying Guild Guide v8.0

This source also applies pathfinder society specific rule set modifictions necessary for any supported pathfinder society approved additional resources.

Known issues:
- p.10 says "Any religion can be chosen from Core Rulebook, The Inner Sea World Guide, Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Gods and Magic or any other source listed as an official Additional Resource." These are not implented here so that the Core Assumption can be used for Core Campaign play. If you want these choices you will have to explicity add the sources you want access to or use the Pathfinder Society Complete multi-set.
- p.10 Valid alignment must be within 1 of the deities choice in most cases. This is not implemented in PCGen. Refer to the guide for details.
- p.14 Librarian and Goldfinger and other traits says you get a bonus on skill OR skill, or skill AND skill, plus you get to choose which skill is a class skill. This implementation interprets the OR or AND to be synonymous and you get the bonus to both skills. You still must choose which skill becomes a class skill.
- p.17 rules for changing faction are not fully implemented. You can track the PP cost using the "Faction Change" ability but none of the other effects of faction change are implemented, e.g. keeping any faction traits, loosing any factio-specific Prestige Awards.
- p.20 additional languages avialable to core campaign have not been implemented: Modern Human Languages: Hallit (Kellid), Kelish (Kelishite), Osiriani (Garundi), Polyglot (Mwangi), Shadowtongue, Shoanti (Shoanti), Skald (Ulfen), Tien (Tian), Varisian (Varisian), Vudrani (Vundrani) Ancient Languages: Ancient Osiriani, Azlanti, Cyclops, Jistka, Tekritanin, Thassilonian, Other Languages: Necril, Orvian
- p.21 day job roles are not implemented.
- p.23 annotation of purchased NPC spellcasting is not supported. Decrement your gold and add a comment to the character bio tab.
- p.24 always available items are not supported. PCGen makes all items available and doesn't track availability by price or type. Consult the guide before making any purchases.
- p.24 prestige points gained per scenario is not supported. You can track your total prestige awards gained by adding "Fame" a total number of times equal to your total Prestige Points.
- p.25 fame's limitation on maximum value of item pruchases is not implemented beyond a simple description in the Fame ability. The inventory tab of PCGen always shows all items ragerdless of price. Consult the guide and your Fame item purchase limits before making purchases.
- p.31 the chronicle sheet award changes for Free RPG Day are not implemented. No chronicle sheet Prestige Point, XP or Gold awards are specifically implemented. Modify your gold, prestige and XP manually according to the scenarios you played.

TODO:
- Tireless trait needs to implement +2 trait bonus on any Constitution checks to resist nonlethal damage from swimming, forced marches, starvation, thirst, and hot and cold environments.
- Attuned to the Ancestors trait need to imlement ability category to allow choice of free language from the following list: Ancient Osiriani, Azlanti, Cyclops, Jistkan, Tekritanin, or Thassilonian.
- Expert Duelist trait needs to add conditional trait bonus to AC to the character sheet somehow.
- Force for Good trait needs to make all good aligned spells function as it the character level is 1 higher.
