#Desnan candle (5 gp; when lit, this foot-long wooden tube launches a flaming pyrotechnic “candle” every round for 4 rounds. Each projectile deals 1 point of nonlethal damage and 1 point of fire damage if it hits; on a critical hit, the target is also blinded for 1 round. The projectiles shed light as candles for 1 round and have a range increment of 5 feet. Attacking with a Desnan candle is a ranged touch attack and always has a -4 nonproficiency penalty.)
#Paper candle (1 gp; This finger-sized explosive detonates noisily 1 round after lighting. Anyone in the same square as a paper candle when it explodes must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1d4 rounds.)
#Skyrocket (50 gp; When lit, this foot-long wooden tube begins to shake and emit a handful of white sparks, shedding light as a torch. One round later it takes flight, moving in a straight line with a fly speed of 90 for 1d6 rounds before loudly exploding in a burst of light and sound, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage in a 10-foot burst [DC 15 Reflex save for half ]. If a skyrocket impacts a solid surface or a creature before reaching its maximum range, it detonates prematurely at the point of impact. Anyone who takes damage from the explosion is either blinded or deafened [a 50% chance of either] for 1 round.)

The arcanolembic can be used to hold one potion. When a creature consumes a potion from the arcanolembic, the potion is treated as if its caster level were 2 higher than the usual minimum for a potion of its level. Placing a potion into the arcanolembic is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
