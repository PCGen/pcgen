# Explanation of tiers:
# The GM checks the total average party level to determine the difficulty tier and in certain cases between two tiers the party can choose to play the higher or lower difficulty tier.
# Scenarios played before 8/14/13: PC's get gold and awards based on the tier played. Thus a level 1 PC playing in a tier 4-5 scenario would get the tier 4-5 gold and rewards. Or a 4th level PC playing in a tier 1-2 scenario would get the lower tier 1-2 gold and rewards.
# Scenarios played after 8/14/13: PC's get awards based on the difficulty tier played. PC's get gold according to the difficulty tier played if their level is the same as the tier. Otherwise they get the awards of the tier played, and the "out of tier" gold.
# Players who played a pregen PC may apply the chronicle to a lower level PC. In that case, the PC's get 500 gp and none of the tier rewards.
# Lastly, players can play any chronicle "normal" or "slow". Slow recieve half the gold, xp and prestige.
