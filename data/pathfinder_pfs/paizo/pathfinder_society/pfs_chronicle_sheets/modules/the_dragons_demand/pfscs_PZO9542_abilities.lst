# Boons
Scalefriend													KEY:PFS Module PZO9542-1 ~ Scalefriend																					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chronicle_PZO9542-1.SpecialQuality						VISIBLE:YES																					DESC:[__] [__] [__] You were fortunate to encounter and aid the kobold Nighttail, who helped you to neutralize the Blood Vow tribe. She still owes you a good turn or two, and you may call in a favor when performing one of the skills below to use Nighttail's skill modifier instead of your own as she assists you. Alternatively, Nighttail can cast a spell as though she shared your space, though any attacks of opportunity she provokes for spellcasting damage you (they still force her to make a concentration check). Using any of the skill-based or spellcasting favors requires your spending the time or actions to perform the task yourself. You may use the favors listed below in any combination, checking off one or more boxes each time you ask for help. When you check the last box, Nighttail's debt has been repaid; cross this boon off your Chronicle sheet. &nl;* Handle Animal +7 &nl;* Survival +10 &nl;* Bluff +9 &nl;* Cast resist energy (CL 1st, concentration +2) &nl;* Nighttail and Hak (The Dragon's Demand 14-15) fight alongside you for one encounter in The Dragon's Demand module. You may use this boon at the beginning of combat or at the start of a combat round. Nighttail and Hak begin combat adjacent to you or in the closest available square, and they act on their own initiative. The pair have a starting attitude of helpful and follow your commands to the best of their abilities, but they are GM-controlled NPCs; a GM may grant you direct control at his or her discretion. If Nighttail and/or Hak die during the encounter, cross the entire boon off your Chronicle sheet.
