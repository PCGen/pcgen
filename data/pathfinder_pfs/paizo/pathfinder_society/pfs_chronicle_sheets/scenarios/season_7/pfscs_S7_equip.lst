Brown E-pick																			TYPE:Technology.PFS				COST:30	WT:1		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01					EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 50 Maximum|CHARGES[50]									SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:An e-pick (short for "electronic lock pick") is a small device that can be used to unlock and disable electronic locks and devices, much in the same way that thieve's tools can be used to dismantle mechanical locks and devices. A brown e-pick is the lowest quality type, and allows a user to make Disable Device checks against electronic devices without penalty. S brown e-pick can be used 50 times before loosing power.
Medlance																				TYPE:Technology.PFS				COST:500	WT:0.01	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01																			SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:This wand-like device contains a reservoir at one end and a small pad at the other. A medlance can be filled with a single dose of liquid, such as a pharmaceutical, a potion, or a poison. It can then be used to administer the liquid to a creature - if the target does not wish to be injected with the medlance's contents, the wielder must succeed at a touch attack to dispense it as a standard action. Otherwise, administering liquid via the medlance is a move action. A medlance doesn't use charges, but after being used to administer 10 injections, its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and the device becomes useless.
Trauma Pack																				TYPE:Technology.PFS				COST:1500	WT:5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01					EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 5 Maximum|CHARGES[5]									SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:This small box of emergency medical gear can be used to augment a creature's Heal skill to allow for enhanced healing. A full trauma pack has enough supplies to be used 5 times before it is depleted. A character using a trauma pack to provide healing can attempt a DC 15 Heal check as a standard action. If the check succeeds, the pack provides 1d8++1 points of healing. For every 5 points by which the Heal check's result exceeds the DC, it provides an additional 1d8+1 points of healing.

Blade of the open road (lesser).MOD																TYPE:PFS						COST:19715	WT:4		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-16																			SOURCELONG:PFS Scenario #6-16 The Golden Guardian																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:Blades of the open road are longswords specifically crafted to strike against the Aspis Consortium. A lesser blade of the open road is a +1 longsword with a Glyph of the Open Road stamped into its hilt. A blade of the open road is a +1 Aspis bane longsword. Against agents of the Aspis Consortium and creatures directly employed by the Aspis Consortium, the weapon's enhancement bonus is 2 higher than its actual bonus, and the weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. A greater blade of the open road has all the properties of the blade of the open road and gains the ominous and heartseeker weapon special abilities against the Aspis Consortium agents and the COnsortium's employees. Any wayfinder the carrier the wielder carries grants a +2 circumstance bonus on all Survival checks, not just checks to avoid becoming lost. A blade of the open road and greater blade of the open road increase this bonus by +4 or +6, respectively. Between scenarios, the wielder can enhance a lesser blade of the open road to become a blade of the open road and later into a greater blade of the open road by paying the difference in price between the two items.

In addition, the haversack resists most wear and tear incurred by the typical adventure - it has hardness 5 and 20 hit points.
