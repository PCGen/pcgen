Vial.COPY=Haunt Siphon
Haunt Siphon.MOD		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS		COST:400	WT:1	DESC:Small wisps of white vapor churn within these glass vials. To capture a haunt's energies in a haunt siphon, twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action) - this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt's area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt. If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green - if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the haunt siphon hits takes 1 point of negative energy damage from the splash. (PFS #7-05)

If a non-evil creature carries the staff, she takes 2 permanent negative levels. These negative levels persist for as long as she holds the staff and cannot be removed by any means (including restoration spells), but they are immediately removed as soon as she sets the staff down. A charwood staff grows into a tree if its user plants it in the ground and speaks the proper command word. This process functions as a permanent tree shape spell that can only target the staff. By speaking the same command word, the tree turns back into a staff. This staff allows use of the following spells: produce flame (1 charge), warp wood (1 charge), diminish plants (2 charges), spike growth (2 charges), and wall of thorns (5 charges).
Staff.COPY=Heartwood Staff

By speaking the same command word, the tree turns back into a staff. This staff allows use of the following spells: entangle (1 charge), wood shape (1 charge), speak with plants (2 charges), plant growth (2 charges), and commune with nature (5 charges). Additionally, while the staff is in tree form, it assists creatures that rest within 20 feet of it for at least 8 hours.

Marvelous Pigments.COPY=Nightmarish Pigments
Nightmarish Pigments.MOD	TYPE:PFS	DESC:Nightmarish pigments function as marvelous pigments, except the items they create subtly bend, warp, and discolor, and they occasionally show reflections of horrific vistas or screaming maws. As a result, they cannot be mistaken for objects made of standard valuable materials like gold. One pot of nightmarish pigments is sufficient to create a 125-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 25-squarefoot surface. The pigments can create a collection of mundane items whose value does not exceed 500 gp.
