Vial.COPY=Haunt Siphon
Haunt Siphon.MOD		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS		COST:400	WT:1	DESC:Small wisps of white vapor churn within these glass vials. To capture a haunt's energies in a haunt siphon, twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action) - this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt's area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt. If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green - if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the haunt siphon hits takes 1 point of negative energy damage from the splash.	SOURCELONG:PFS #7-05
