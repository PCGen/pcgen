Inner Struggle													KEY:PFS Scenario 7-01 ~ Inner Struggle																						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chronicle_S07-01.PFSBoon						VISIBLE:YES																					DESC:Your exposure to a mindscape has given you a unique way to fight off psychic magic. When you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting compulsion effect, you can cross this boon off your Chronicle sheet in order to delay the effect and be stunned until the end of your next turn instead as you retreat into your own personal mindscape to fight off hostile magic. At the end of your turn, you can attempt a new saving throw against the effect to end it. If you succeed, the effect ends. If you fail the save, the original effect overpowers your mental defenses and resumes.

Embeth Hound													KEY:PFS Scenario 7-02 ~ Embeth Hound																						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chronicle_S07-02.PFSBoon						VISIBLE:YES																					DESC:The Embeth Travelers gift you with a loyal Embeth hound at no cost. An Embeth hound is a riding dog who receives +4 racial bonus on all Climb and Swim checks in place of a riding dog's typical +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks while jumping. An Embeth hound is trained for combat and additionally knows the Track trick. If the Embeth hound dies, cross this boon off your Chronicle sheet.

Henbane's Token													KEY:PFS Scenario 7-02 ~ Henbanes Token																						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chronicle_S07-02.PFSBoon						VISIBLE:YES																					DESC:Inquisitor Henbane leaves you with a token of her favor. This enchanted flower from a henbane plant allows its wearer to step outside of the flow of time. As a purely mental move action, you can destroy the flower to disappear completely one round. While you are out of time, you cannot be affected by any spells or effects, and any ongoing durations of spells or effects affecting you do not continue to progress. You also cannot take any actions while out of time. At the beginning of your next turn after disappearing from time, you reappear in the same square you left (or the closest open space if it is occupied). Once you expend the token's power, cross this boon off your Chronicle sheet.

Touched by Time													KEY:PFS Scenario 7-02 ~ Touched by Time																						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chronicle_S07-02.PFSBoon						VISIBLE:YES																					DESC:You have passed through time-distorting portals un Uringen, and residual magic from that experience clings to you. You may cast either haste or slow as a spell-like ability, using your character level as your caster level and CHarisma as your key ability score. WHen you use this boon, cross it off your Chronicle sheet.
