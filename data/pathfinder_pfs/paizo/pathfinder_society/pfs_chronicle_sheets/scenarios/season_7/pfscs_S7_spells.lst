Covetous Aura	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Abjuration	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:25-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.418	DESC:Anytime a harmless (so noted by a spell's saving throw description) spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within a covetous aura's area of effect, you may choose to immediately gain the benefit of that spell as it had also targeted you. The intended target still gains the effect of the spell. You gain the benefits of this duplicated spell only if the caster is in range of the covetous aura. Each time a covetous aura duplicates a spell effect, the remaining duration of the covetous aura is reduced by a number of rounds equal to the spell level of the spell effect that is duplicated.

# TODO: This spell is also Arcanist,Witch=5 but those sources are not included in the core assumption. Must add new PCC loaded lst files using PRECAMPAIGN for these:
#Covetous Aura.MOD		CLASSES:Arcanist=5
#Covetous Aura.MOD		CLASSES:Witch=5

#
# DONE
