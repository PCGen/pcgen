Synthesis Rod		TYPE:PFS.Technology	COST:25000	WT:8	SOURCELONG:PFS #8-04
	DESC:Nanites inside this synthesis rod gradually convert air into rare chemical gases. A fully charged synthesis rod contains 3 charges and regains 1 charge every 24 hours. By spending 1 charge as a standard action, the wielder can release a blast of caustic poison in an adjacent 5-foot square. By spending 2 charges, the area increases to a 15- foot cone. Creatures in the affected area take 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 16 half). Any creature harmed this way is also exposed to caustic creep poison.

	DESC:Kineticists are especially equipped to channel this rod’s abilities. Either by expending 1 additional charge or accepting 1 point of burn that cannot be reduced, the blast’s acid deals 3d6 damage or an amount equivalent to the kineticist’s energy blast, whichever is higher. When doing so, the kineticist can also use her substance infusion save DC in place of the poison’s save DC. Once per day, a kineticist able to channel air can activate this enhanced effect without expending an additional charge or accepting burn.
