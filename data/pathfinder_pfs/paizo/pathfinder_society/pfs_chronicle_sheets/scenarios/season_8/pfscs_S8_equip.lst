Synthesis Rod							TYPE:PFS.Technology					COST:25000	WT:8																							SOURCELONG:PFS #8-04																																																																																		DESC:Nanites inside this synthesis rod gradually convert air into rare chemical gases. A fully charged synthesis rod contains 3 charges and regains 1 charge every 24 hours. By spending 1 charge as a standard action, the wielder can release a blast of caustic poison in an adjacent 5-foot square. By spending 2 charges, the area increases to a 15- foot cone. Creatures in the affected area take 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 16 half). Any creature harmed this way is also exposed to caustic creep poison.
Caustic Creep							TYPE:PFS.Poison						COST:0	WT:0																							SOURCELONG:PFS #8-04				SPROP:Inhaled; Fort DC 15; Freq 1/round for 4 rounds; Effect 1d2 Con; Cure 2 consecutive saves																																																															DESC:Kineticists are especially equipped to channel this rod's abilities. Either by expending 1 additional charge or accepting 1 point of burn that cannot be reduced, the blast's acid deals 3d6 damage or an amount equivalent to the kineticist's energy blast, whichever is higher. When doing so, the kineticist can also use her substance infusion save DC in place of the poison's save DC. Once per day, a kineticist able to channel air can activate this enhanced effect without expending an additional charge or accepting burn.

Glowing Gourd (Lesser)						TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS					COST:1200																								SOURCELONG:PFS #8-06	SOURCEPAGE:.	SPROP:This gourd has been hollowed out and carved with the symbol of a good-aligned deity. It sheds light as a candle. If the gourd is smashed onto the ground, the 20-foot-radius area around the crushed gourd is affected as if by a consecrate spell for 10 hours, and all non-evil creatures in the area gain the benefits of remove fear for 5 rounds. This magic item is often crafted from a pumpkin, though other types of gourds, or even large turnips, can be used.

# PFS #8-10
Lantern (Hooded).COPY=Keylight Lantern			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS					COST:2000	WT:1																							SOURCELONG:PFS #8-21	SOURCEPAGE:.																																																																															DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:A keylight lantern is wreathed with elemental runes. When lit, it gives off light as per a typical lantern, but the shifting flame gives its user a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks to find secret doors. In addition, once per day, the lantern's bearer can fling the oil as a splash weapon that functions as a flask of acid, except that its damage type is random among acid, cold, electricity, and fire. Each keylight lantern has an indentation where an elemental gem could fit. If an elemental gem is slotted in the lantern, the damage type is fixed based on the gem's element-acid for an earth gem, cold for a water gem, electricity for an air gem, and fire for a fire gem. The lantern's bearer may choose to expend the elemental gem to infuse the oil with its energy. If she does so, the next time she throws the oil, it functions as per fireball, centered on the square (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 14 half) instead of as an acid flask. The damage type of the fireball matches the damage type associated with the elemental gem.

# PFS #8-12
Horn of Fog.COPY=Horn of the Hurricane			TYPE:PFS							COST:20000	WT:2																																																																																																												DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:This curved length of opaque crystal twists and expands from its mouthpiece, ending in a small raging tornado. Angry lightning dances within the crystal whenever the horn is sounded. THe horn can be blown, as a standard action, to create a 20-foot cone of eviscerating elemental lightning that deals 5d6 points of electricity damage aginst creatures with the air subtype, and it ignores any immunities or resisstances to electricity that such creatures may possess. A successful DC 17 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Creatures with the air subtype take a -4 penalty in their saves against this effect.	DESC:&nl;If the horn of the Hurricane is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20%% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to the person sounding it.

# PFS #8-13
Heavy Pick (Base).COPY=Fossilblight				TYPE:Artifact.Minor.PFS.Specific.Light Source	COST:-35000	WT:6		EQMOD:Material ~ Adamantine ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +3 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Keen ~ Weapon	MODS:NO			SOURCELONG:PFS #8-13	SOURCEPAGE:.																																																																															DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:This +3 keen adamantine heavy pick emits dim light from its diamond head. Once per day, as a swift action, the wielder can cause Fossilblight to ignore the hardness or DR of a single object or creature (including DR/mythic) within 60 feet for the next 10 minutes. This weapon is capable of making critical hits against elementals, despite that creature type's normal immunity to such attacks. Whenever the bearer makes a successful critical hit, as an immediate action she can voluntarily cease wielding Fossilblight and have the weapon pin the target against any adjacent solid object. The weapon's CMD for the purpose of escaping this effect is equal to half the damage dealt during the critical hit. A creature pinned in this way takes 2d6+6 points of damage at the end of its turn for the first 3 rounds in which it remains pinned.

# PFS #8-15
Gloomspire Tisane							TYPE:Magic.Wondroud.Consumable			COST:2250	WT:0																							SOURCELONG:PFS #8-15																																																																																		DESC:By imbibing this bitter dark violet brew, a creature gains the ability to safely access any of the Gloomspires. Though the spires continue to shift for creatures that do not drink Gloomspire tisane, a creature consuming it can access any of the Gloomspires as if they were fixed in place. Additionally, while under the brew's effects, a creature can see twice as far as normal in conditions of fog or mist. For example, it can see creatures up to 10 feet away when in a fog cloud instead of only 5 feet (though such creatures still have concealment). The tisane's effects last for 24 hours. As soon as the effects end, the creature experiences a madness-inducing waking nightmare and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage.
Spectre moss							TYPE:Magic.Wondroud.Consumable			COST:1200	WT:0																							SOURCELONG:PFS #8-15																																																																																		DESC:When eaten, this sweet-tasting spongy moss grants immunity to energy drain and negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy, for 1 minute. Eating spectre moss does not remove negative levels that the creature has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from negative levels for the duration of its effect.

# PFS #8-17
Jistkan Stone Golem Manual					TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:22000	WT:5																							SOURCELONG:PFS #8-17																																																																																		DESC:This ancient rune-carved book functions as an ordinary stone golem manual, but contains additional instructions to call elemental spirits into lifeless stone. When you are adjacent to at least 2,000 pounds of natural, unworked rock, you can take a full-round action to summon a stone golem (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 163) that emerges from the rock. The golem follows your commands perfectly for 1 round for each Hit Die you possess before vanishing along with the Jistkan stone golem manual.

# PFS #8-20
Potion.COPY=Elixir of dragon's breath (brine dragon)	TYPE:Magic.Potion.Consumable.Combat Gear.PFS	COST:2000	WT:0																			MODS:NO			SOURCELONG:PFS #8-20	SOURCEPAGE:.	SPROP:This vial contains a swirling current of luminescent blue liquid. A creature that drinks the liquid can breathe out a single blast of energy that deals 10d6 points of acid damage in a 30-foot line, plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage for each Water Affinity boon you have earned on any of your characters. The magic of the elixir ends after one use of the breath weapon or after 1 hour has passed, whichever comes first.						DESC:.CLEAR
Full Plate (Base).COPY=Nautilus coral armor		TYPE:Magic.PFS										EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Armor.Material ~ Coral													SOURCELONG:PFS #8-20	SOURCEPAGE:.	SPROP:This +1 full-plate is made of coral and pieces of nautilus shell. This armor does not impose an armor check penalty on Swim checks. The wearer can hold her breath underwater for a number of rounds equal to four times her Constitution score, rather than twoce her Constitution score. You can increase the armor's enhancement bonus or apply armor special abilities as though the armor's masterwork piece were 7,000 gp.								DESC:.CLEAR

# PFS #8-22
Explosion Pocket							TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:3000	WT:0.5																						SOURCELONG:PFS #8-22																																																																																		DESC:An explosion pocket looks like a cloth pouch just large enough to contain a Small or Medium humanoid's hand. When placed against a shirt, vest, jacket, trousers, or similar piece of clothing, this ragged green patch attaches to the clothing, creating a loose pocket. The pocket functions as a normal pocket, but once per day the pocket's wearer can, as a standard action by speaking a command word while his hand is in the pocket, cause the pocket to create a single vial of alchemist's fire. If a vial of alchemist's fire is in the explosion pocket when it is commanded to create a vial of alchemist's fire, the pocket instead supercharges the existing vial within so that it deals double the normal fire damage a vial of alchemist's fire would normally inflict. An explosion pocket can be removed as a full-round action, allowing it to be placed on a different piece of clothing as the owner wishes. A vial of alchemist's fire created or supercharged by an explosion pocket reverts to a vial of inert, bitter-tasting water 1 minute after it is created or supercharged.
