As long as you do not mistreat your new ally and your alignment does not become evil at any time, she agrees to travel with you. You may use this boon in one of two ways. First, you may take a pseudodragon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 229) as a familiar with the Improved Familiar feat as long as you are a spellcaster of at least 5th level (rather than 7th).
