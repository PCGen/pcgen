Check a box before this boon to cast one of the following as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. Instead of a material component cost, each spell-like ability comes with an alternative price. Ask other players for their permission before activating these abilities on them. Do not cross this boon off your Chronicle sheet; it might play a role in future adventures.	DESC:&nl;Divination: Incomprehensible forces bring the answers you seek, but their stark revelations leave your mind fragile. The next time you are in combat, you are subject to a lesser confusion spell (Will DC 15 negates). You can choose to raise your effective caster level to 20th for this effect, at the cost of being subject to confusion instead (Will DC 24 negates).	DESC:&nl;Stoneskin: The target's skin turns scaly and weeps a pungent black liquid. The unsettling aroma grants the target a –4 penalty on saving throws against effects that would sicken or nauseate her for 24 hours.	DESC:&nl;Restoration: The target's mind is haunted with cryptic visions, rendering her immune to morale bonuses for 24 hours. If you use the version of this spell with a typical material component cost of 1,000 gp, then the target is overcome by the sensation that precious memories are disappearing from her mind. She cannot access her fondest memories for 24 hours—a distressing development that renders her immune to all beneficial mind-affecting effects during this time.
