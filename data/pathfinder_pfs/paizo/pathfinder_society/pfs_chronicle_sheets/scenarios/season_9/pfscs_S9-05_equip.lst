Shards of Aucturn	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS	COST:400	WT:0	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S09-05	DESC:This bag contains 56 assorted pieces of debris connected to the distant planet Aucturn. Dumping the bag fills a 10-foot square area with shards, which function as magic caltrops with a +1 bonus on their attack roll. If a creature steps on a shard, it suffers the usual effects of a caltrop injury, and the shards animate into a swarm (rolling their own initiative). The activated shards function as a spider swarm without poison. A creature that takes damage from the swarm must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points of precision damage from invasive lacerations to whichever ability score is currently the highest. Once activated, the shards attack their target and any other nearby creatures. After 5 rounds, the shards disintegrate.
