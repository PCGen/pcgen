Whenever you drink a potion or extract of 3rd level or lower with a variable numeric effect, you can check a box next to this boon as a swift action to maximize the benefit received (for example, when drinking a potion of cure light wounds that would normally restore 1d8+1 hit points, you could check a box next to this boon to heal the maximum possible amount of 9). Alternatively, you can check a box next to this boon when stopping to eat to grant you and up to five allies a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves for the next 24 hours.

Since Emilio has well-founded concerns that Amynta could have spies watching for him at the site, he has left the recovery of this treasure to you. You may spend your downtime to check one of the boxes that precedes this boon. Upon checking the third box, you uncover the ancient Varisian cache, earning you a number of gold pieces equal to 100 × your current character level and restoring up to 2 expended Prestige Points as your archaeological findings are reported to the Society.

Characters with this boon can purchase disguise kits at half price. This reduction in cost does not stack with any other boons or abilities that reduce the cost to purchase disguise kits, and disguise kits obtained in this manner cannot be sold for more than was spent to acquire them under any circumstances.

You have received three bottles of a rare and potent vintage as congratulations. As a standard action, you may check one of the boxes next to this boon to draw and drink a bottle of this refined beverage, healing yourself for 1d8 hit points per 2 levels you have (maximum 5d8). The effects of this beverage may be maximized using the Chef 's Secret Recipes boon.
