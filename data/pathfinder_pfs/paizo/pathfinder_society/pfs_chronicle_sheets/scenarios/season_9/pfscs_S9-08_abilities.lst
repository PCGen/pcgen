	VISIBLE:YES
	COST:0
	DESC:Thanks to your work in Ridonport, your name is on display as a patron for the General Arnisant Museum and Historical Residence. In addition to gaining a permanent +1 bonus on Knowledge (history) checks regarding Taldor, you can borrow a weapon or suit of armor from the museum. After hearing the adventure briefing for a scenario, you can check one, two, or all three boxes that precede this boon to secure a weapon, shield, or set of armor with a +1, +2, or +3 bonus, respectively, for the duration of the scenario. You can reduce the enhancement bonus of a borrowed weapon with a +2 or +3 bonus by 1 in order to give that weapon the undead bane special ability. Any borrowed equipment bears inscriptions or imagery from the Shining Crusade, such as Aroden's holy symbol or the heraldry or Taldor. This equipment is always made of common materials such as steel, leather, or wood.

	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Background,Sovereign Court Faction
	DESC:You have performed a significant service for the Sovereign Court and, by extension, for Princess Eutropia. She has granted you the title of baronet (a landless title) in recognition of your services. This grants you Knowledge (nobility) as a class skill; if it's already a class skill, you gain a +1 bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks. In addition, you gain a free noble's outfit and several pieces of jewelry to complete the ensemble. The outfit and accessories have an effective resale price of 0 gp.
	DESC:&nl;You can use your Downtime to attempt a Knowledge (nobility) check to build connections within Taldor's elaborate noble hierarchy, laying the groundwork for your own promotion later. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + 1/2 your character level (minimum +0). If you succeed, check one of the boxes below. If your check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, you can instead check two boxes. If you already have (or later gain) another boon or vanity that grants you a noble title in Taldor, you can immediately check five boxes.
	DESC:&nl;Once you check all of the boxes below, you become a true landgrave (in charge of a nonwilderness region that lacks a significant settlement) or viscount (in charge of a few small settlements). You immediately gain a number of gold pieces equal to 75 × your XP total. In addition, you can now earn gold by administering your lands, allowing you to use Diplomacy or Knowledge (nobility) for Day Job checks. When doing so, a result of 40 or higher earns you 150 gp and allows you to regain 1 previously expended Prestige Point. If you already have the ability to use Diplomacy or Knowledge (nobility) for Day Job checks, you gain a +3 bonus on such checks.
