	DESC:This gold-edged +1 blinding shield has all the properties of a celestial shield (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 131), except that its synergy with celestial armor boosts the caster level of the armor's granted fly spell to 7th instead of replacing it with overland flight. It can be upgraded into a standard celestial shield by paying the difference in price.
