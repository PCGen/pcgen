When you receive this Chronicle sheet, you can check the box that precedes this boon to change your patron deity to any legal lawful good deity, in the process changing your alignment to lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good. When you do so, you receive the benefits of an atonement spell without paying any associated costs. Additionally, you may freely retrain any class abilities, feats, or other features that no longer function with your new deity, as well as character abilities that are directly tied to your old deity's favored weapon, such as the Weapon Focus feat. This boon does not affect your character's items.
