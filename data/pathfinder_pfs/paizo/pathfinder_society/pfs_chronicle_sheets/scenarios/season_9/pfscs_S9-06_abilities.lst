	DESC:Your experiences in Heaven have inspired you to change your philosophy. When you receive this Chronicle sheet, you can check the box that precedes this boon to change your patron deity to any legal lawful good deity, in the process changing your alignment to lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good. When you do so, you receive the benefits of an atonement spell without paying any associated costs. Additionally, you may freely retrain any class abilities, feats, or other features that no longer function with your new deity, as well as character abilities that are directly tied to your old deity's favored weapon, such as the Weapon Focus feat. This boon does not affect your character's items.

	DESC:Your studies of sacred scripture have enhanced your knowledge about matters of faith. If you are trained in Knowledge (religion), you can check a box that precedes this boon to add 1d6 to the result of one Knowledge (religion) check after rolling but before learning the results of your roll. Alternatively, you can check a box before rolling a Knowledge (religion) check to treat that check as if you were trained in the skill. You can use both boxes on a single skill check.

	DESC:You have been infused with a portion of Heaven's grace. You can check the box that precedes this boon to use the standard action version of lay on hands as if you were a paladin of your character level. If you already have lay on hands as a class feature, you can instead check this box to add 2d6 to the amount healing you provide with one of your uses of lay on hands.
