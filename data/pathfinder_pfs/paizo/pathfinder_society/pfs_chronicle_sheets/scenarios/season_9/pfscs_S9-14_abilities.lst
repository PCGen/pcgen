	DESC:The insight you have gained from your studies in the First World helps you channel the influence of the seasons, honing your understanding of the balance of elemental forces. You may check off the first box before this boon in spring, the second in summer, the third in autumn, and the fourth in winter, using real-world seasons. For the abilities listed below, your caster level is equal to your character level.
	DESC:&nl;Spring: You can channel the essence of autumn's harvest. This functions as goodberry, except that its target is any plant, and it causes 2d4 pumpkins to sprout that grant the berry's typical benefits.
	DESC:&nl;Summer: You can channel the essence of winter's chill into a creature you touch. This functions as shocking grasp, except that it deals cold damage instead of electricity damage.
	DESC:&nl;Autumn: You can channel the essence of spring's growth, casting entangle as a spell-like ability.
	DESC:&nl;Winter: You can channel the essence of summer's heat, casting burning hands as a spell-like ability.
	DESC:&nl;Once you have checked all four boxes, you gain access to the elf racial spell ward of the seasons (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 29) on all of your Pathfinder Society characters as if they were elves. Your elf PCs gain a +1 bonus to their effective caster level for the purposes of this spell.
