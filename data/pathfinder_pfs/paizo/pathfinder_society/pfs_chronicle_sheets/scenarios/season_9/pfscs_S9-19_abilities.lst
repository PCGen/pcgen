As a sign of camaraderie, they have introduced you to a skilled bladesmith. When you would purchase a specific magic weapon in the fighter's light blades or heavy blades weapon group, you may check the box before the boon to replace the weapon with a different weapon in the same group. To determine the price, use the difference in price between the standard base weapon and the new base weapon. For example, a short sword of venom, based off a dagger of venom, would cost 8,310 gp.	DESC:&nl;To perform this substitution, the weapon's total price must be less than 25,000 gp, and it cannot be a unique weapon from another Chronicle sheet.

As a standard action, you can cross off this boon to remove the fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition from a target you touch, as if using the paladin's mercy ability. If you have the mercy ability, you may instead cross off this boon to apply any mercy that you qualify for but did not select to one of your uses of lay on hands.

You may cross this boon off your Chronicle sheet as a swift action to use smite evil as a paladin of half your character level with 16 Charisma. If you already have the ability to smite evil, you may cross this boon off your Chronicle sheet as a part of using smite evil to treat your paladin level as 4 levels higher for that smite.
