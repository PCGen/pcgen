	DESC:Colson Maldris's sins were unforgivable. Whether you chose to let him die to focus your efforts on protecting his victims from the same fate or because of spite for Maldris himself, you allowed him to be executed by final blade. A group within the Liberty's Edge faction who has long hoped to be rid of Maldris's shadow is now working to supply your missions. After the mission briefing but before the first encounter, you can check a box that precedes this boon to borrow a +1 bane weapon, choosing the target of the bane property and the weapon type. Alternatively, you may borrow 20 pieces of +1 bane ammunition, all of which target the same creature type. Return the weapon, including any unused ammunition, at the end of the scenario.

	DESC:Colson Maldris lives, thanks your efforts. Whether you acted out of concern or care for the man himself, out of determination to avoid an international incident, or out of principle, Maldris is immensely grateful to you. Though he is stepping down from leadership, he retains some friends and contacts within the faction, which he leverages for your benefit. When playing an adventure, you can fulfill and check up to two boxes on your Liberty's Edge Faction Journal Card. Additionally, you can check one or more of the boxes that precede this boon when expending Prestige Points to reduce the cost of any purchase by 4 Prestige Points for each box checked (minimum 0).

	DESC:You responded to the mobs of Galtan citizens with nonviolence, and in so doing helped forge a path for a peaceful resolution to what could have become an international incident. For your actions, you receive official commendation from the government of Andoran. All of your characters gain access to the Oath of the People's Council (Pathfinder Player Companion: Divine Anthology 20) as if it appeared on the Additional Resources list.
