Whether you chose to let him die to focus your efforts on protecting his victims from the same fate or because of spite for Maldris himself, you allowed him to be executed by final blade. A group within the Liberty's Edge faction who has long hoped to be rid of Maldris's shadow is now working to supply your missions. After the mission briefing but before the first encounter, you can check a box that precedes this boon to borrow a +1 bane weapon, choosing the target of the bane property and the weapon type. Alternatively, you may borrow 20 pieces of +1 bane ammunition, all of which target the same creature type. Return the weapon, including any unused ammunition, at the end of the scenario.
