Brown E-pick																			TYPE:Technology.PFS				COST:30	WT:1		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01					EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 50 Maximum|CHARGES[50]									SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:An e-pick (short for "electronic lock pick") is a small device that can be used to unlock and disable electronic locks and devices, much in the same way that thieve's tools can be used to dismantle mechanical locks and devices. A brown e-pick is the lowest quality type, and allows a user to make Disable Device checks against electronic devices without penalty. S brown e-pick can be used 50 times before loosing power.
Medlance																				TYPE:Technology.PFS				COST:500	WT:0.01	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01																			SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:This wand-like device contains a reservoir at one end and a small pad at the other. A medlance can be filled with a single dose of liquid, such as a pharmaceutical, a potion, or a poison. It can then be used to administer the liquid to a creature - if the target does not wish to be injected with the medlance's contents, the wielder must succeed at a touch attack to dispense it as a standard action. Otherwise, administering liquid via the medlance is a move action. A medlance doesn't use charges, but after being used to administer 10 injections, its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and the device becomes useless.
Trauma Pack																				TYPE:Technology.PFS				COST:1500	WT:5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01					EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 5 Maximum|CHARGES[5]									SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:This small box of emergency medical gear can be used to augment a creature's Heal skill to allow for enhanced healing. A full trauma pack has enough supplies to be used 5 times before it is depleted. A character using a trauma pack to provide healing can attempt a DC 15 Heal check as a standard action. If the check succeeds, the pack provides 1d8++1 points of healing. For every 5 points by which the Heal check's result exceeds the DC, it provides an additional 1d8+1 points of healing.
pipes of the sewers.COPY=Subsonic Vermin Manipulator
Subsonic Vermin Manipulator.MOD																TYPE:Technology.PFS						COST:300			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01					EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 60 Maximum|CHARGES[60]									SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:This is a set of pipes of the sewers that uses Perform (keyboard), though it only functions for 60 rounds before permanently running out of power.
rope of climbing.COPY=Linear Gravity Buffer
Linear Gravity Buffer.MOD																	TYPE:Technology.PFS						COST:500			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-01					EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 10 Maximum|CHARGES[10]									SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-01																																			SPROP:This is a rope of climbing that instead creates a violet beam that can be climbed, though it only functions for 10 minutes (in 1-minute intervals) before permanently running out of power.

# PFS #6-03
Cureall				TYPE:Technology.Consumable.PFS		COST:1400	WT:0.2	SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-03		DESC:A dose of cureall allows the target to attempt an additional saving throw against a single disease or poison effect currently afflicting him. This additional saving throw counts for the total number of successful saves needed to recover from the disease or poison. If the target is suffering from multiple afflictions, a single dose of cureall works against only the effect with the highest save DC currently afflicting him. Cureall also restores 1d4 points of ability damage or 1 point of ability drain that has been inflicted by a disease or poison, even if the user doesn't succeed at the save. A dose cures any ability drain before curing ability damage. If the target is suffering from drain or damage to multiple ability scores, the cureall cures the score with the most damage or drain (or randomly selects one if multiple scores have equal drain or damage).	
Hype				TYPE:Technology.Consumable.PFS		COST:1400	WT:0.2	SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #06-03		DESC:A synthetic adrenaline derivative once used by soldiers, hype boosts perception and reaction time but comes with some nasty side effects. This pharmaceutical has an onset time of 1 round and its effects last for 1 hour. It provides a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks and increases the user's base land speed by 10 feet, but the user takes a -4 penalty on concentration checks and on all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks (with the exception of Perception).

Gamin is a +1 allying mithral longsword APG with the permanent broken condition, and when held he can cast guidance on his wielder at will. Only a master swordsmith might repair Gamin's imperfections, and the Pathfinder Society does not have access to such a resource at this time.
Gamin the Misforged (repaired).MOD																											PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,PFS Scenario 6-07 ~ Master Smith's Service																																																							SPROP:Gamin was repaired by the slag giant Valsog (boon Master Smith's Service from PFS Chronicle #6-07 Valley of the Veiled Flame).

In addition, the haversack resists most wear and tear incurred by the typical adventure - it has hardness 5 and 20 hit points.

Longsword (Base).COPY=Blade of the open road (lesser)		VISIBLE:YES		EQMOD:Material ~ Steel
Blade of the open road (lesser).MOD																TYPE:PFS						COST:19715	WT:4		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S06-16																			SOURCELONG:PFS Scenario #6-16 The Golden Guardian																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:Blades of the open road are longswords specifically crafted to strike against the Aspis Consortium. A lesser blade of the open road is a +1 longsword with a Glyph of the Open Road stamped into its hilt. A blade of the open road is a +1 Aspis bane longsword. Against agents of the Aspis Consortium and creatures directly employed by the Aspis Consortium, the weapon's enhancement bonus is 2 higher than its actual bonus, and the weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. A greater blade of the open road has all the properties of the blade of the open road and gains the ominous and heartseeker weapon special abilities against the Aspis Consortium agents and the COnsortium's employees. Any wayfinder the carrier the wielder carries grants a +2 circumstance bonus on all Survival checks, not just checks to avoid becoming lost. A blade of the open road and greater blade of the open road increase this bonus by +4 or +6, respectively. Between scenarios, the wielder can enhance a lesser blade of the open road to become a blade of the open road and later into a greater blade of the open road by paying the difference in price between the two items.

# PFS #6-98
#Armor of luck (18,500 gp plus the price of a suit of masterwork armor of the appropriate type) You may purchase a suit of armor that has all of the properties of a banded mail of luck. This armor may be of any type (such as leather, breastplate, or full plate), but it cannot be made of a special material.
#Circlet of persuasive disguise (7,200 gp): This splendid circlet functions simultaneously as a circlet of persuasion and a hat of disguise.
#Elven rune-cloak (price varies): This diaphanous cloak functions simultaneously as a cloak of elvenkind and a cloak of resistance. To calculate its price, add 3,750 gp to the market price of a cloak of resistance. You may upgrade the resistance bonus to saving throws granted by the cloak following this same calculation (e.g. upgrading an elven rune-cloak's resistance bonus from +1 to +2 costs 3,000 gp).
#Lesser versatile metamagic rod (6,000 gp): This functions as a metamagic rod (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 484) and has 3 charges per day; however, these charges can be used to replicate the effects of any of the following metamagic feats: Extend Spell, Merciful, or Reach Spell.
