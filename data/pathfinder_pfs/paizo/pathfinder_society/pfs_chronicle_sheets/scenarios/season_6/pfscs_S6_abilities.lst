Trapmaker							KEY:PFS Scenario 6-99 ~ Trapmaker																				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chronicle_S06-99.PFSBoon						VISIBLE:YES																					DESC:A kobold from the Sewer Dragon tribe taught you a few trap-making tricks and provided you with a few specialized supplies. You can use these supplies, together with materials that you have collected in your adventures, to assemble the swinging axe trap (see Chronicle) with a successful Craft (traps) check. You can attempt to make the trap more deadly, at the cost of making it more difficult to craft. Before attempting the check, you may increase the DC of the Craft (traps) check by up to +1 per character level. For each point by which you increase the Craft DC, increase the trap's Perception and Disable Device DCs by 1, its attack bonus by 1, and the damage it deals to each target by 2. Assembling the trap takes 5 minutes. If you fail the Craft (traps) check, you do not create a functioning trap, but you still expend the materials. Once you use this boon, cross it off your Chronicle Sheet.

#Armor of luck (18,500 gp plus the price of a suit of masterwork armor of the appropriate type) You may purchase a suit of armor that has all of the properties of a banded mail of luck. This armor may be of any type (such as leather, breastplate, or full plate), but it cannot be made of a special material.
#Circlet of persuasive disguise (7,200 gp): This splendid circlet functions simultaneously as a circlet of persuasion and a hat of disguise.
#Elven rune-cloak (price varies): This diaphanous cloak functions simultaneously as a cloak of elvenkind and a cloak of resistance. To calculate its price, add 3,750 gp to the market price of a cloak of resistance. You may upgrade the resistance bonus to saving throws granted by the cloak following this same calculation (e.g. upgrading an elven rune-cloak's resistance bonus from +1 to +2 costs 3,000 gp).
#Lesser versatile metamagic rod (6,000 gp): This functions as a metamagic rod (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 484) and has 3 charges per day; however, these charges can be used to replicate the effects of any of the following metamagic feats: Extend Spell, Merciful, or Reach Spell.
