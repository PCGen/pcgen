Acrimony Veil																			TYPE:Magic.Wonderous.Head.PFS			COST:13500	WT:1		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S04-02																			SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #04-04																																			SPROP:Acrimony veils are rare ancient magic devices created by Alaznist, the Runelord of Wrath . They are normally composed of several types of interconnected metal and human bones, each etched with complex designs. The device covers the wearer's entire face (forehead, cheeks, and jaw), but provides no benefit to AC. This mask functions as a lesser empower metamagic rod, but only affecting spells of the evocation school . Additionally, the wearer of an acrimony veil may cast rage on himself once per day.

Shambler Vine																			TYPE:Magic.Wonderous.PFS			COST:600	WT:1		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S04-06																			SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #04-06																																			SPROP:A shambler vine resembles a leafy green plant vine about 6 feet long, wrapped in a coil. If touched, it writhes as if alive. Up to three vines can be stored in a small sack, though the price is for one. When thrown at an opponent, a vine grows in midair, and acts as a rope of entanglement. It can reach 20 feet forward or 10 feet upward to entangle the target. The entangled target can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. A shambler vine has AC 22, 12 hit points, hardness 10, and damage reduction 10/slashing. It does not repair itself, and if it is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed. The vine lasts for a single use before withering away, and if left on a target that is unable to get free, the vine withers after 1 hour.
#Aura strong transmutation; CL 12th

Additional failed saves increase the effect's duration but not its severity.
#Whip +1 (Sickening) cost s/b 7015, so MAGIC_COST is adjusted to make the total correct
Sihedron Brand (Endurance)																	TYPE:Magic.Wonderous.PFS			COST:4827	WT:0		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S04-08																			SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #04-08																	BONUS:SAVE|Fortitude|2|TYPE.Profane													SPROP:This dark image of the Sihedron rune appears to writhe beneath the surface of the skin on which it isin scribed, as though a worm were crawling under the skin. A character marked with this arcane tattoo receives a +2 profane bonus on Fortitude saves. Once perday, the character may activate the tattoo to receive a number of temporary hit points equal to twice her character level. Displaying the arcane tattoo grants a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against worshipers of Lissala.

Gamin the Misforged.MOD																		TYPE:PFS						COST:20	WT:2		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S04-19					EQMOD:ALLYING.BROKEW.MAGIC_COST|-2000.MITHRAL_ITEM.PLUS1W					SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #04-19																																			SPROP:(cost s/b 7015) This glittering blade is clearly defective, and a rippling break runs from its tip to its hilt like a crack in a broken window. Gamin is a +1 allying mithral longsword APG with the permanent broken condition, and when held he can cast guidance on his wielder at will. Only a master swordsmith might repair Gamin's imperfections, and the Pathfinder Society does not have access to such a resource at this time.

Ratskull																					TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Neck.PFS				COST:7200	WT:0.5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S04-S2																			SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #04-S2															DESC:This gnarled black rat skull is carved with intricate necromantic runes and hangs on a ragged leather strap. Three times per day, the wearer of the ratskull can call upon its power as a full-round action to summon a swarm of undead rats. This functions as summon swarm, using the exact same statistics as a rat swarm except that they are also undead. The rat swarm obeys the wearer's commands for 5 rounds before crumbling to dust.

Simply carrying this crystal provides protection against negative energy. Whenever the bearer takes damage from negative energy, such as channel energy or an inflict spell, she takes 10 less points of damage. This reduction is applied after any saving throw is made. The crystal may possess other powers, but they are unknown at this time.
