#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Race. (F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,

#can find them listed under the topic "PRExxx tags".
#
#The LANGAUTO tag is holding a list of languages that the character automatically gains.
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description

#race, such as the Rangers Favored Enemy.
#
#In the HITDICEADVANCEMENT tag the last number of this comma delimited list is the highest HD the creature can advance to,
#through HD advancement. All the numbers preceding the last number each indicate the highest number of HD the creature can have
#before its size increases by one category.
