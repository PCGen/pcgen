# Original Entry by Paul W. King

# Marksman is waiting on code bug ([ 1080148 ] -2 penalty for long range hardcoded) to be cleared so that LONGRANGE can be altered). Also need to figure out how to only select a certain portion of Weapon Focus choices
# Commando Training missing DESC

# Sharpshooter: Weapon Focus(TYPE=Ranged) doesn't work. I don't think there is way right now to do this. The user will have to make sure to select only ranged weapons here.
# Marksman: I put in a chooser and a SA that lists the allowed range penalty offset -- Frank Kliewe
