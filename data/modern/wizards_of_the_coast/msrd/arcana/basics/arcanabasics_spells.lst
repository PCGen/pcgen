###Block: Long Descriptions
# Spell Name				Classes of caster						Description
Arcane Graffiti.MOD											DESC:This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or a short message, which can be no larger than 2 feet tall and consist of no more than six words, on a nonliving creature or object. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane graffiti spell enables you to etch the words upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harming the material upon which the mark is placed. If invisible graffiti is made, the casting of any spell or use of any spell-like ability within 30 feet causes the words to become visible for 5 rounds. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or with a clean spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Burglar's Buddy.MOD											DESC:This spell suppresses all mechanical or electronic intrusion alarms and alarm sensors in the affected area. Burglar alarms or other intrusion alarms within the affected area simply fail to function; sensors for intrusion alarm systems (such as motion detectors, IR detectors, pressure sensors, electric eyes, and so forth) also fail to function, sending no signal to monitoring stations. Video surveillance devices continue to send whatever image they were photographing the moment when the spell was cast. Material Component: A camera lens cover.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clean.MOD													DESC:The clean spell completely eliminates grime, dirt, and bacterial contaminants from the target. Smooth surfaces gain a faint shine, as if they had been polished. If cast on a room or object, the clean spell destroys dirt, dust, and anything else that would ordinarily be wiped away with a thorough mundane cleaning. The room or object retains no fingerprints, and even the smallest hairs, skin cells, and garment fibers are cleaned away-rendering most evidence collection impossible, for example. If cast on a creature, the clean spell disinfects wounds (doubling the natural healing rate for that day) and renders the creature scentless for 1 minute. This means that creatures with the scent extraordinary ability won't be able to detect the subject by scent alone. Material Component: Bar of soap.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clown Car.MOD												DESC:You create a temporary extradimensional space within an enclosed passenger compartment of a vehicle. The spell cannot be cast on vehicles without enclosed passenger compartments, such as motorcycles. The extradimensional space allows the vehicle to hold a number of additional passengers equal to the caster's level. A passenger may be up to Large size and can bring up to a medium load into the extradimensional space; creatures with more than a medium load cannot enter the extradimensional space. Creatures that enter the extradimensional space cannot interact with anything outside of the vehicle, nor can creatures outside the vehicle perceive or interact with the occupants and contents of the extradimensional space (or even see the extradimensional space itself). Creatures within the extradimensional space effectively occupy the same 5-footsquare and are incapable of making attacks while so contained. Exiting the extradimensional space requires the passengers to physically exit the vehicle as well. If the vehicle is destroyed or the extradimensional space is successfully dispelled, the extradimensional space collapses. Any creatures or objects within the extradimensional space are ejected before the space implodes. Ejected creatures fall prone in squares adjacent to the vehicle. Focus: A klaxon, which must be honked when the spell is cast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crawling Carpet.MOD											DESC:You summon a number of monstrous insect swarms, each of which attacks any creature occupying its square. Each square of the spell's effect contains a swarm of monstrous spiders, monstrous scarab beetles, or monstrous centipedes, to a maximum of 12 swarms, assuming that the spell's effect isn't blocked by obstacles. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that flee. Use the monstrous spider swarm statistics for monstrous scarab beetle swarms and monstrous centipede swarms as well.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dancing Lights.MOD											DESC:You create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or flashlights (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light, or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, and so forth. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and the nearest light exceeds the spell's range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Darkness.MOD												DESC:This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20- foot radius. Not even creatures who can normally see in the dark (such as with darkvision) can see in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (flashlights, candles, lanterns, and so forth) do not illuminate the darkened area, nor do light spells of lower level (such as light and dancing lights). Darkness and the 2nd-level spell daylight cancel each other, leaving whatever light conditions normally prevail in the overlapping areas of the spells. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dataread.MOD												DESC:You run your finger over any machine-readable data source (a barcode, a computer disk, a CD, magnetic tape, or any similar record) to understand the content of the data. You experience the data as it would normally be experienced through an appropriate machine. For example, if reading a music CD, you hear the music in your head. If reading a word processor file, you visualize and read an image of the page. If reading a barcode, you see the serial number, pricing information, or other barcoded data. The amount of time required to experience the data is the same as that required to read it by conventional means. You can normally read 2 pages of documents in 1 minute. This spell does not decode encrypted data. Without the encryption code, an encrypted document or file appears as a seemingly random string of characters. If you know the encryption code, however, you can read encrypted data normally with this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Daylight.MOD												DESC:The object touched sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius. Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them while exposed to this magical light. Despite its name, this spell isn't equivalent to daylight insofar as it does not damage or destroy creatures normally harmed by daylight (such as vampires). If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Daylight counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Degauss.MOD													DESC:By touching a single device that contains electronic files, such as a computer, external hard drive, CD-ROM, or magnetic disk, you erase all files on that device. The device is rendered empty of data.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Scrying.MOD											DESC:You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of scrying (including the scrying spell). The spell's effect radiates from you moves as you move. The spell also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magic scrying devices. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area. If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location. If the attempt originates outside this range, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks. If you match or beat the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and a sense of the scrier's direction and distance from you (accurate to within one-tenth the distance). Material Components: A small shard of mirror and a miniature trumpet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divination.MOD												DESC:Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. In all cases, the GM controls what information the caster receives. Note that if the caster doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information no longer proves useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70%% + 1%% per caster level. The GM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, the caster knows the spell failed unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination and yield the same answer each time.  Material Components: Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to the caster's religion (purchase DC 13). |PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Electromagnetic Pulse.MOD										DESC:When you cast electromagnetic pulse, you send a powerful burst of energy that ruins electronic circuitry within the spell's area. Any computer, telephone, television, or other device with a computer processor inside ceases to function immediately, and the contents of hard drives and other storage media are scrambled. The electromagnetic pulse affects only devices with extensive circuitry, not everything that uses electricity. Ordinarily the lights stay on, although their electronic switches might not function. Automobiles continue to run, although their engines will run more roughly without electronic guidance. Most cars manufactured after the 1980s won't start after an electromagnetic pulse because they have electronic ignition systems. Devices affected by an electromagnetic pulse can be fixed according to the following table.  You can jury-rig repairs more quickly and cheaply, but the repairs may not last. See the description of the Repair skill for details. Some military gear is immune to energy effects such as electromagnetic pulse thanks to a process called tempest hardening. Tempest hardening adds +1 to the purchase DC of an item and makes it Restricted (+2).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Faerie Fire.MOD												DESC:A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally caused by darkness (but not magical darkness), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects.  The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or darkdwelling creatures. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your word at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Gaseous Form.MOD												DESC:The subject and all her gear become insubstantial, misty (or smoky), and translucent. The subject gains damage reduction 10/+1. Her material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though her size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and Defense bonuses from force armor (for example, from the mage armor spell) still apply. She becomes immune to poison and critical hits. She can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. The subject loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If she has a touch spell ready to use, it is discharged harmlessly when the spell takes effect. The gaseous subject can't run but she can fly (speed 10 feet, perfect maneuverability). She can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all she was wearing or holding in her hands, as long as the spell persists. She is subject to wind. She can't enter water or other liquid. Material Component: A bit of gauze or pinch of ash.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Haywire.MOD													DESC:The haywire spell causes a single device to behave randomly and erratically, defying any attempts to bring it under control. Cash registers display random prices and open their money drawers repeatedly. Escalators surge forward, then reverse themselves. Automatic teller machines flash random patrons' account balances on the screen as they spew forth receipts (not money, though). It's impossible to describe the exact effects of haywire on every modern device. In general, a machine subject to haywire functions as if someone were pressing random buttons or otherwise manipulating it randomly. Turning off a device subject to a haywire spell doesn't work, because the spell disables the "off" switch. Cutting off the power supply (by unplugging it, for example) disables the device 1d4 rounds later, ending the spell. Material Component: A small magnet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Arcane Lock.MOD										DESC:As arcane lock, except as described above. Additionally, improved arcane lock closes all targeted doors or containers if they're open when the spell is cast, then locks them. Unlike most spells, the caster need not have an unblocked line of effect to each door targeted by the spell, but the caster must know the location of each door. Mages and Techno Mages often use improved arcane lock to simultaneously close and lock every door in a building, either to trap something inside or lock something out.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Instant Connectivity.MOD										DESC:Instant connectivity can only be cast through a computer network (see the Casting Spells through Email sidebar). With the aid of instant messaging software, you physically transport the subject or subjects from one place to another. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, up to eight creatures can be affected by the spell at the same time. At least one of the creatures affected must be touching a computer with an Internet connection and active instant messaging (IM) software. The targets must be sent to a specific IM address that is currently active online. Instant connectivity causes the targets to appear in the room from which that IM address is being accessed, automatically gaining surprise on anyone else in that room. Focus: A computer hard drive (purchase DC 23 or higher).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Instant Identify.MOD											DESC:The spell determines all magic properties of a single magic item, including how to activate those functions (if appropriate) and how many charges (if any) are left. Arcane Material Component: A pearl (purchase DC 12).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Machine Invisibility.MOD										DESC:The creature or object touched cannot be detected by video cameras, electronic sensors, or other high-tech detection machines. The creature is also invisible to mechanical constructs such as gear golems, digital homunculi, and mechanical homunculi. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, the gear is likewise undetectable. The subject is missing from still photos taken while the spell is in effect, closed-circuit television monitors don't display the subject, and other machines are likewise fooled. The creature or object touched can stand on a scale and doesn't appear to weigh anything. Infrared and heat sensors detect only the ambient heat levels. X-ray machines don't reveal the presence of an object with machine invisibility. Microphones don't pick up sounds that the subject makes directly, although they will pick up sounds that subject makes by interacting with the environment. A hidden microphone wouldn't hear the subject's voice but would record the sound of that creature throwing a brick through a window. Items dropped or put down by an affected creature become visible to machine detectors; items picked up disappear if tucked into clothing or a bag carried by the creature. Light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect in a photograph or video image is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an "attack" includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. If the subject attacks directly, however, the subject and its gear immediately becomes visible to machines. While machine invisibility is useful for many tasks requiring stealth, it sometimes makes the subject's life more difficult. A stoplight sensor under an intersection might not pick up a motorcycle with machine invisibility. Automatic sliding doors at the supermarket won't open for the subject of machine invisibility. Talking on the telephone or radio is impossible. Focus: A glass lens, which the caster fogs by breathing on it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Bullets.MOD												DESC:You enhance up to 50 individual bullets of the same caliber or a single magazine of up to 50 rounds with the power of a 1stlevel spell you already know. The bullets must be fired from a gun for the subsidiary magical effects to take hold. The related spells you must know to create magic bullets of a particular type are listed below. Each time you cast the spell, all the bullets receive the same enchantment, but afterward it is possible to mix magic bullets with different effects in the same magazine. Be sure to note the order in which the bullets are loaded to correctly track the effect of each shot. Unless otherwise noted, magic bullets deal normal damage before they impart their magical effect. This spell can be used to create one type of bullet (as noted in the chart below), or others at the GM's discretion.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Circle.MOD												DESC:This spell wards an area from attacks by creatures of a specific allegiance (chosen when the spell is cast), from mental control, and from summoned or conjured creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 10 feet. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects: First, everyone inside the magic circle gains a +2 deflection bonus to Defense and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply only against attacks made by creatures with the specified allegiance. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess creatures within the magic circle (as by a possession incantation). The barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. Third, the magic circle thwarts any attempt to exert mental control over creatures within its area. If a dominated creature enters the magic circle, mental control is lost for the duration of the magic circle spell or until the creature leaves the protected area. Fourth, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures of the specified allegiance. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching a creature inside the magic circle. The protection against contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if anyone inside the magic circle makes an attack against a blocked creature or the subject tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and reach and step inside the magic circle.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic ID.MOD												DESC:With this glamer, you make a small card or slip of paper appear to be a valid identification card of your choosing. The card bears your name, likeness, and all other data expected by anyone examining such a card. However, it is only visually accurate and does not contain any valid machine-readable data or electronic coding. You cannot use this spell to make an electronic passkey. The illusion lasts only as long as you touch the card, to a maximum of 5 rounds. Focus: A small card or slip of paper.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Message.MOD												DESC:This spell imbues a modern device such as a television, radio, computer monitor, or news ticker with a message you set that's delivered when a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 words or less, is delivered in a manner appropriate to the device targeted by the spell. A newscaster on a targeted television will appear to speak the message. A stereo plays the message as a repetitive song lyric. An electronic traffic sign displays the message for all motorists to see. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or specific as desired, although only visiual and audible triggers can be used such as the following: *Deliver the message when a man in a dark suit walks past with a gun drawn.* Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger (it's common for a television to flicker to life in a dark apartment, delivering a magic message). Magical darkness and invisibility will defeat a visual trigger, however, and silent movement and magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, elevator music) or to a specific noise or a spoken work. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, "Deliver the message when any creature picks up the talking doll" is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A magic message cannot distinguish class, level, Hit Dice, or allegiance. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic message to respond to triggers up to 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the magic message can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. Material Component: A carved jade figurine (purchase DC 8).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mask Metal.MOD												DESC:This glamer makes a metal object undetectable to metal detectors. When any creature or character makes a Search or Spot check to detect the object, he or she does not gain equipment bonuses from any device that detects metal. Material Component: A magnet. |PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mending.MOD													DESC:Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (not warps). In metallic objects, it will weld a broken chain link, a necklace, or a knife, providing but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a backpack or garment is completely healed over by mending. The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical abilities are not restored. The spell has no effect on creatures (even constructs).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nondetection.MOD												DESC:The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination and detection spells, such as scrying. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself. Material Component: A pinch of diamond dust (purchase DC 10).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Obscuring Mist.MOD											DESC:A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has one-half concealment (attacks have a 20%% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50%% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flaming wrath, or similar spell burns away the fog in the spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage. This spell does not function underwater.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantasmal Killer.MOD											DESC:You create the phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can perceive the phantasmal killer. You see only a shadowy shape. The subject first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If the subject fails the Will save, the phantasm touches him, and he must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Chopper.MOD											DESC:You conjure a quasi-real motorcycle. The motorcycle can be ridden only by you or the one person for whom you specifically create the cycle. A phantom chopper looks like a heavily customized motorcycle of indeterminate make and model. It has realistic-looking license plates, and you decide what the license plate says when you cast the spell. The phantom chopper has a Defense of 10, hardness of 5, and 20 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom chopper disappears. A phantom chopper has a top speed of 40 feet per caster level, an initiative modifier of +0, and a maneuver modifier of +1. The phantom choppers gains certain powers according to caster level. A motorcycle's abilities include those of motorcycles of lower caster levels. 7th Level: The motorcycle can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed. 8th Level: The motorcycle can ride over water as if it were firm, dry ground. 9th Level: The motorcycle can ride in the air as if it were firm land, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. The phantom chopper cannot take off and fly. It can only ride horizontally across the air. After 1 round in the air, the motorcycle falls.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Limousine.MOD											DESC:You conjure forth a quasi-real limousine that seats eight Medium characters (two in the front and six in a comfortable passenger area), four Large creatures (one in the front and three in the back), or sixteen Small creatures (four in the front and twelve in the back). The limousine has the exterior color and design details you choose when you prepare the spell, and the interior is one of opulent luxury. You decide what its license plates look like when you cast the spell. The phantom limousine has a Defense of 6, hardness of 15, and 50 hit points +1 point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom limousine disappears. A phantom limousine is much faster than it looks, with a top speed of 60 feet per caster level, an initiative modifier of -2, and a maneuver modifier of -2. A phantom limousine has enough luxurious food and drink inside to provide a hearty meal for all passengers. It has all the powers of a phantom chopper (ability to drive over bad terrain, water, or air). Additionally, it is airtight and can even travel underwater at a speed of 10 feet per caster level. Focus: A pair of car keys on a silver keychain.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Projectiles.MOD											DESC:You turn ammunition (such as arrows, bolts, bullets, and shuriken) into incorporeal projectiles that damage only their intended targets. Phantom projectiles pass through intervening obstacles (including armor) and thus ignore cover bonuses and equipment bonuses to Defense. Barriers of magical force, such as a wall of force, stops them. Phantom bullets count as having a +3 enhancement bonus for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, although they don't actually receive the enhancement bonus on attacks or damage. Additionally, the phantom bullets disappear 1d4 rounds after being fired, making it impossible to gather ballistic evidence. Material Component: In addition to the bullets, the caster needs a small chunk of lithium.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rage of Bees.MOD												DESC:You summon 1d3 swarms of sentient killer bees, each one filling a 5-foot square within the spell's effect. The swarms independently attack targets designated by you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Recharge.MOD												DESC:By converting electrical energy into eldritch power, you can recover quickly from debilitating physical effects. However, you must draw current from a wall socket to power this healing magic. The recharge spell instantly eliminates the following conditions: cowering, dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, shaken, and stunned. The caster can heal herself of some of these conditions, but others (such as stunned) don't allow spellcasting or other actions. In addition, the recharge spell instantly cures blindness or deafness caused by a spell or spell-like ability, and it grants a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves against poison for 1 minute. Focus: An active electrical outlet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Relay Text.MOD												DESC:You cause a text message of up to 25 words to appear on the screen of an electronic device capable of receiving such messages, such as a cell phone, pager, PDA, or computer. If the device is turned on, the message appears instantly; if not, the message appears as soon as someone turns it on. The message remains onscreen until read, then disappears, leaving no electronic record of its appearance. You must have seen the device to send a message to it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sanctuary.MOD												DESC:Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of the attacker's action is lost, and the attacker can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act. This allows a warded acolyte to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, summon creatures, and so on.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scrying.MOD													DESC:You can see and hear some creature, who may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds at a Will save, the scrying attempt fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane or in some other dimension (such as the extradimensional space created by a clown car spell), it gains a +5 circumstance bonus to its Will save. If the save fails, you can see the subject and the subject's immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. The following spells, if active on the caster during the scrying, operate through the sensor: darkvision, read magic, tongues, and true seeing. Detect magical aura has a 5%% chance per caster level of operating correctly through the sensor. Arcane Material Components: Some droplets of nitric acid in an eyedropper. Arcane Focus: A mirror of finely wrought silver (at least 2 feet by 4 feet) or an orb of polished crystal (at least 5 inches in diameter). Either item has a purchase DC of 19. Divine Focus: A font filled with holy water (purchase DC 8).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secret Pocket.MOD												DESC:The secret pocket spell creates an extradimensional space that only you can reach through a pocket in the target garment. The secret pocket can hold 1 pound per caster level, and you can put anything in it that will physical fit through the pocket opening. The item can be of any length and isn't otherwise restricted by the pocket's actual dimensions-it just has to be able to fit through the opening. The contents of the extradimensional space never cause the pocket to bulge, and items inside the secret pocket have no weight once they're placed inside (although the weight still counts against the capacity of the extradimensional space). Whenever you reach into the pocket, you access the extradimensional space rather than the actual pocket. Anyone else who examines the pocket finds it completely ordinary. If someone else puts something in the pocket, you can't reach it because your hand goes into the extradimensional space instead. You can give the garment to someone else to wear if you like, but only you can access the extradimensional space through the pocket. Arcane Material Component: A black handkerchief.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secret Vault.MOD												DESC:You hide a briefcase, backpack, dufflebag, or similar item in an extradimensional space for up to 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The item used as a secret vault can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the item's actual size). If you put anything living inside the secret vault, the spell fails. Once you cast the spell, the item and its contents disappear. You can retrieve it anytime thereafter by concentrating (an attack or move action), and it appears next to you. To create the secret vault, you cast the spell while touching both the full-size container and a miniscule replica of it. The container and anything within it or touching it (subject to the volume limitation above) vanishes into an extradimensional space. You need the miniature replica to recall the container. After 60 days, the container reappears in your hand whether you wish it to or not. Focus: A briefcase, duffle bag, or similar container prepared with expensive and rare reagents, as well as a miniscule replica of it. The actual storage container and the miniature replica have a combined purchase DC of 25.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Seeming.MOD													DESC:This glamer functions like the change self spell except you can change the appearance of other creatures as well. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or with spell resistance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadowmoth Plague.MOD											DESC:You summon a number of shadowmoth swarms, each of which attacks any creature occupying its square. Each square of the spell's effect is filled with a swarm of shadowmoths, to a maximum of 12 swarms, assuming that the spell's effect isn't blocked by obstacles. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that flee.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shatter.MOD													DESC:Shatter creates a loud, ringing noise that shatters brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature. Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of glass, crystal, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, windows, mirrors, bottles, windshields, and so forth. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered. Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic/concussion damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage. Focus: A tuning fork.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shield Other.MOD												DESC:This spell creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of the subject's wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to Defense and a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including damage dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, and level draining are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject. If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends. Focus: A pair of platinum rings (purchase DC 15 each) worn by both you and the warded creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shutdown.MOD												DESC:All electrical devices within the spell's area-lights, computers, cell phones, digital watches, and so forth-do not function for the duration of the spell. The spell does not prevent devices outside of the area of effect from operating normally, even if they are on the same electrical circuit as those affected. (Even if the spell is cast on a generator supplying power to devices outside the area of effect, those outside devices continue to remain powered.) At the end of the spell's duration, the devices operate again as if their operation had not been interrupted. (Computers do not need to be restarted, and clocks display the correct time.) Many sophisticated mechanical devices, including automobiles and aircraft, rely on electrical components, and so are usually affected by this spell. Arcane Material Components: The CONTROL, ALT, and DELETE keys from a computer keyboard.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Speak with Animals.MOD											DESC:You can comprehend and communicate with animals. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from animals, although the spell doesn't make animals any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If the animal is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you (as determined by the GM). This spell does not work on magical beasts or vermin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Immunity.MOD											DESC:The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, such immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply. Spell immunity protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. A creature can have only one spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Resistance.MOD											DESC:The creature gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Vivilor I.MOD											DESC:This spell summons a 1st-level vivilor, a strange creature from the edge of Shadow. The caster chooses the form the vivilor will take when it appears, and the vivilor maintains that shape for the duration of the spell. The vivilor appears where you designate and acts immediately, attacking your enemies unless you give it other orders. You can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The vivilor acts normally on the last round of the spell and dissipates into nothingness at the end of its turn. You choose the form the vivilor will take.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Vivilor II.MOD											DESC:As summon vivilor I, except you can summon one 2nd-level vivilor or 1d3 1st-level vivilors. If you create more than one vivilor, you can choose their forms separately; they need not be identical.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Vivilor III.MOD											DESC:As summon vivilor I, except you can summon one 3rd-level vivilor, 1d3 2nd-level vivilors, or 1d4+1 1st-level vivilors. If you create more than one vivilor, you can choose their forms separately; they need not be identical.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Vivilor IV.MOD											DESC:As summon vivilor I, except you can summon one 4th-level vivilor, 1d3 3rd-level vivilors, or 1d4+1 2nd-level vivilors. If you create more than one vivilor, you can choose their forms separately; they need not be identical.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Vivilor V.MOD											DESC:As summon vivilor I, except you can summon one 5th-level vivilor, 1d3 4th-level vivilors, or 1d4+1 3rd-level vivilors. If you create more than one vivilor, you can choose their forms separately; they need not be identical.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Synchronicity.MOD												DESC:The synchronicity spell subtly rearranges reality so that the subject isn't inconvenienced by the minor delays in modern life. For the subject of synchronicity, the traffic light is always green and there's always a waiting elevator. On a city street, synchronicity ensures that a taxicab pulls up within 1 round of the subject standing on the curb. The subway trains always run on time for the subject of synchronicity, and waiters and clerks promptly arrive whenever they're needed. Though designed for convenience, the synchronicity spell offers advantages for a caster in harm's way. The subject of synchronicity can run at full speed through even through a dense crowd, because people subconsciously move aside. The synchronicity spell also provides a +4 bonus to Defense when the subject's movement provokes an attack of opportunity (just like the Mobility feat), because even enemies have a tendency to stay out of the subject's way. Synchronicity is also useful during car chases. Because other cars naturally get out of the way and traffic lights always turn green, a driver with synchronicity gains a +8 inherent bonus on Drive checks in urban areas and can make an unlimited number of avoid hazard and hard turn stunts (drivers are ordinarily limited to one or two stunts). When engaged in vehicular hide-and-seek, the synchronicity spell provides a +8 inherent bonus on Bluff and Hide checks (if you're being chased) or Sense Motive and Spot checks (if you're pursuing another vehicle) because other cars and pedestrians naturally aid your efforts. Arcane Focus: A gold-level credit card or garage door remote control.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trace Purge.MOD												DESC:When you cast this spell, you touch one creature (yourself or someone else). The spell eliminates all physical evidence left by that person's body (fingerprints, fluids, hairs, and so forth) within the affected area along with any evidentiary materials accidentally deposited by that person's body, clothes, or gear (such as fibers, mud, dust, and so forth). The spell only affects materials no larger than a few strands of hair or a few ounces of dirt. It does not change any disturbances that person created (including footprints, tool marks, or broken items) or remove any object the target person deliberately left. Arcane Material Component: A pair of tweezers.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undetectable Magical Aura.MOD										DESC:This glamer allows you to mask a magic item's aura from detection. It fools detect magical aura spells such that the item appears nonmagical. If the object bearing undetectable magical aura has instant identify cast on it, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds at a Will save. Focus: A small square of silk that must be passed over the object.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vampiric Touch.MOD											DESC:You must succeed at a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. However, you can't gain more than the target's current hit points +10, which is enough to kill the target. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Via Negativa.MOD												DESC:When you cast the via negativa spell, your right hand is covered with crackling black energy that causes intense pain to any living creature that comes into prolonged contact with it. Meanwhile, it imbues you with necromantic power. The via negativa spell affects any living creature that you grapple, dealing 4d6 points of damage on round the grapple is initiated and each round the grapple is maintained. If your foe escapes the grapple, you can attempt to attain another hold. Furthermore, the via negativa spell grants a +5 enhancement bonus to Strength as long as you're grappling. The somatic component for the via negativa spell begins with a handshake motion. If you use an innocuous handshake with someone to start an via negativa spell, your melee touch attack automatically succeeds and you don't provoke an attack of opportunity to start the grapple. Arcane Focus: A ring with a black pearl (purchase DC 22).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall Walk.MOD												DESC:An improved version of the spider climb spell, wall walk allows for faster, easier movement. The subject can travel on vertical surfaces or ceilings as well as they can walk on the ground. No matter how smooth the wall, the subject of a wall walk spell can run up it or even fight from a sideways position, never needing to make Climb checks to do so. The subject can switch from floor to walls to ceilings as many times as his speed allows. Unlike the spider climb spell, wall walk doesn't require the subject to use his hands to climb, so the subject can hold items and wield weapons normally. Material Component: A black strip of Velcro.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wire Walk.MOD												DESC:You and any other objects or creatures targeted by the spell teleport instantly to the location of a telephone you call. The telephone must be answered; the spell only works over an open line. You arrive adjacent to the device (within 5 feet of it), and any other creatures transported by the spell appear next to you. For example, you might use a cell phone to call home. As soon as anyone answers the phone (including an answering machine), you could use the spell to teleport home. Willing subjects of the spell (and the objects they carry) need not make a saving throw, nor does spell resistance apply in this instance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
