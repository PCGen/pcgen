Design Goals:


Dynamic Pools



Training Points are the Gold Standard -

We need a method to DEDUCT from the Pools and if auto granted NOT deduct.

Soltution 1-

COST:0 on the Abilities for starters - this means that no pool is really deducted from.
BONUS:VAR used in granting and removing pool points.


RANGE in OS cannot be hard coded to give 30 or whatever. We need a fixed range. Should be feasible.

Weapon must be coupled with Melee or Ranged. This is hardcoded.


Do We actually need 'RACE'? It seems to be Human centric, so I don't see a need to belabor race. Not on the Killshot Character Sheet Either.
