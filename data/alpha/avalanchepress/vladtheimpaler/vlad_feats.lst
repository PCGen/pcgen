#NOTES, ISSUES (jerril 2003-08-01):
#Behead:
#         Behead requires Weapon Focus in an edged weapon.
#         Currently PCGen can support weapon focus in a specific weapon,
#         or any kind of weapon focus. Weapon types are not yet supported.
#         I'm leaving this as requiring a generic weapon focus untill the code changes.
