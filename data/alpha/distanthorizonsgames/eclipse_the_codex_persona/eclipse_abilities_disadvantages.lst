Accursed						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Accursed						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:The universe is out to get you. This covers literal curses, such as dooming those you love, terrible fates, bleeding fire instead of blood, or uncontrollable lycanthropy, as well as lesser, persistent annoyances. The latter might include being a preferred target for attacks (you count as two people if random targeting is used), unpleasant disabilities such as epilepsy, allergies and so on. Your curse can be lifted, but it requires a great deal of work or truly major magic.					MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE=Accursed																			COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	BENEFIT:You have an affliction or curse.
Aged							KEY:Disadvantage ~ Aged							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You didn't take up adventuring until late in life. You are middle-aged or older and may, at the option of the GM, have an extra level or two with the points assigned to abilities of little use in adventuring - giving you a starting edge at the cost of a long-term penalty.																																																																	COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	BENEFIT:You are older than normal adventurers.
Blocked						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Blocked						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You cannot use some type of ability to which you'd normally have access.

Broke							KEY:Disadvantage ~ Broke						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You start with only a third of the usual cash and equipment you would be entitled to by your level.

Compulsive						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Compulsive						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You have some particular mania or "code of conduct" which influences everything you do. Likely compulsions include the classic manias (like Pyro- or Klepto-), an overwhelming love or hatred, greed, dedication to some peculiar goal, truthfulness, extravagent spending, or even virtue. Codes include things like Hippocratic Oaths or Chivalry. Characters that ignore their compulsions take a 20%% experience penalty.																MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE=Compulsive																			COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	BENEFIT:You have the listed compulsions.
Dependent						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Dependent						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:There is something you just have to have to function effectively. You could be addicted to a drug, rely on a special talisman, require constant support and encouragement, or simply be so confused that you need someone to tell you what to do. Unless there's a specific effect involved this defaults to a -3 penalty on your rolls.																														MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE=Dependent on What																	COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	BENEFIT:You require the listed items to function.
Foolish						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Foolish						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You don't learn as quickly as usual, and so take a 20%% experience point penalty.

Frail							KEY:Disadvantage ~ Frail						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You must make a (DC 18) Fortitude save after casting a spell of level 3+ or fighting for three rounds. On a failure you take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and become staggered for 1d4 rounds.

While this is common enough with respect to details, in your case it may extend to things like whether it's daytime.

Do not try to be the party spokesman. It just won't work out.																																																	COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:You aren't trustworthy.
Valuable						KEY:Disadvantage ~ Valuable						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You are worth a lot of money.

Vows							KEY:Disadvantage ~ Vows							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disadvantage.DisadvantageCounter													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:While closely related to Compulsive, Vows are generally more restrictive.
