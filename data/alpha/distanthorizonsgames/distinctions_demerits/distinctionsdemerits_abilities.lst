Attunements / 0			KEY:Dist_Attune_0				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Distinctions	DESC:modify how magic "works" for a character. Common variants include having to study before you go to sleep rather then after - although you still must get enough sleep to fully empower those spells - regaining mana at some time other then the usual in a mana-based system, "attunement" to a specific spell (Allowing you to cast it as if it was one level lower), an inability to give up your personal energies to make magic items, learning an extra rune or spell, having a unique "flourish" or "signature" that appears in all your spells - or perhaps only when you want it to - having to sing your spells when you're not a bard of some sort, being able to get a "natural" power boost in some specific situation (Whenever you use a pinch of ruby dust, whenever Sagittarius is ascendent, etcetera), working your magics thru spirits who can be persuaded to make minor adjustments in the spells but sometimes aren't entirely reliable, being able to boost your effective casting level by taking extra time, performing all of your verbal components with a harmonica, being dependent on a talisman to wield some of your powers, using an exotic magical style, having the ability to change your spell selections a bit more quickly then usual, being a "vessel" of mana in spell point based systems, (Some can simply transfer it to other people, others can be drained by any skilled mage who touches them), only gaining a portion of the usual spells after you sleep and study - or mana whenever it's regained - being able to draw on extra mana or spells for a minute or so around that time, being a "spell vampire", who does not gain spells normally but must drain them from other spellcasters, being unusually bad (or good) at magics in a particular school, the ability to "supercharge" a spell once a day, getting too much mana or too many spells when they're renewed (And causing random effects or problems unless precautions are taken), or losing spells or mana slowly through the day regardless of whether or not you expend them. Obviously enough, most of this doesn't mean much unless you're a spellcaster. Affinities affect your ability to use particular types of magic items; you may have trouble with wands, or be able to make unusually good use of them, find that magical weapons do not function for you, or that scrying devices will occasionally grant you glimpses of things far beyond their usual limits.

Backgrounds / 0			KEY:Dist_Backgrounds_0			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Distinctions	DESC:are things like; "Father was a fisherman and he used to take me out with him sometimes before I was apprenticed out". They're normally only taken during character creation, game masters may occasionally allow it later on if it doesn't conflict with the existing backstory. They normally provide basic (+4) competence in two relevant, if nonadventurous, skills (Generally in "Craft", "Profession", or "Area Knowledge") and a few basic local contacts. Backgrounds like "I'm the son of a pirate king" tend to cost more - and often require buying some other perks to back them up. The "Classical Education" background is a common variant (implying a fair knowledge of literature, possibly knowing a dead - and mostly useless - language or two, and either some theology or whatever passes for "general science" in the setting. Sadly, much of this information may be wrong, and almost none of it is practical). Other educational backgrounds may be considerably more practical - and more expensive. More unusual backgrounds are also straightforward, although they usually cost three or four distinction points. You'll probably have to come up with a character history to be able to get one - but if you want to have an odd character class from 2000 miles away, hail from another world entirely, or to have been raised by wolves, then this is the distinction for you.

Backgrounds / 5			KEY:Dist_Backgrounds_5			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Distinctions	DESC:are things like; "Father was a fisherman and he used to take me out with him sometimes before I was apprenticed out". They're normally only taken during character creation, game masters may occasionally allow it later on if it doesn't conflict with the existing backstory. They normally provide basic (+4) competence in two relevant, if nonadventurous, skills (Generally in "Craft", "Profession", or "Area Knowledge") and a few basic local contacts. Backgrounds like "I'm the son of a pirate king" tend to cost more - and often require buying some other perks to back them up. The "Classical Education" background is a common variant (implying a fair knowledge of literature, possibly knowing a dead - and mostly useless - language or two, and either some theology or whatever passes for "general science" in the setting. Sadly, much of this information may be wrong, and almost none of it is practical). Other educational backgrounds may be considerably more practical - and more expensive. More unusual backgrounds are also straightforward, although they usually cost three or four distinction points.

Property / 5			KEY:Dist_Property_5			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Distinctions	DESC:ranges from the simple - owning a fine sword, a home, or some ordinary slaves (A depressingly common &amp; accepted practice in almost every culture's history to date) - on up through the complexities of a business, estate, or trading vessel (around which a lot of your adventuring is likely to revolve), and on to the weird stuff - being the heir to a haunted castle, owning an artifact (not necessarily a good thing AT ALL), having access to a reliable supply of poison, medicines, holy water, or whatever, or simply having some extra starting gear. Items like an indestructible costume, having really large Debts to pay off, or having gear which looks impractically odd but works perfectly well, also fall into this category. "Bonded" items - magical devices which are somehow linked to their user or which have actually become a part of him or her, and so can be upgraded by investing experience, attribute, or skill points in them, are a common variant. Property is usually a distinction, but a cursed item, inconvenient inheritance, huge debt, sought-after map, or any item which brings unwelcome attention or responsibilities, can be a demerit.

Quirks / 0				KEY:Dist_Quirks_0				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Distinctions	DESC:are psychological problems. These range from things like the old "Snakes... Why did it have to be snakes?" on through phobias, weird compulsions, and even various "virtues" which limit the characters freedom of action. Being hot-tempered, honorable, excessively helpful, gullible, greedy, chivalrous, an anti-slavery activist (seriously strange throughout almost all of history), compulsively honest, absentminded, having weird beliefs (I must always wear this helm to keep the brain-eaters out!), leaving a "signature" (E.G.; the "mark of Zorro") behind, being lecherous, irreverent (priests normally hate this), fanaticism, over- or under- confidence, vanity, obsessions, sadism, impatience, being easy to bribe, cowardice, being disrespectful - or overly respectful - of authority, wealth and power, being a spendthrift or a practical joker, and many more. In general, it takes a difficult self-control check with game-master assigned modifiers to resist a quirk. While there are no inherently "good" quirks, they can have positive aspects in many situations; excessive loyalty may be a nuisance most of the time, but it will help you resist magical or psychic compulsions to betray your friends.
