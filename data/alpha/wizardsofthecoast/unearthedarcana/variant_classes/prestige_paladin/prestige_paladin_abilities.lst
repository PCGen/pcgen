#These abilities add the paladin spells to the appropriate class.
#Note that we actually might want to add this in a more appropriate fashion, with a chooser, but that is not possible with the current tags.
#Note that these are only the core classes, and when using sources with additional (divine casting) classes, the appropriate abilities would need to be added.
#Note that these are only the spells from the RSRD.
