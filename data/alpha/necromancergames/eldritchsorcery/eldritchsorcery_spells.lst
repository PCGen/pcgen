# Original Entry by: Tir Gwaith

#	Several Spells have Save info None (harmless), and Spell Res No (harmless) ??
#			Why the (harmless) if None and No???
#	Charm Animal/Person, Mass - Comps V, when the normal spell is V, S?
#	Charm Person, Mass -- Really supposed to be days/level?
#	Claws of Digging - Save info and Spell resistance
#		- shouldn't they be the same as Claws of Beast?  Fortitude (harmless) and Yes (harmless)?
#	Cloak of Serpents - lists itself as Serpent [Good] 5, but no such domain listed.
#	Divining Rod - shouldn't it be Comps F, not M?
#	False Tracks - Comps "M"  ---- um...
#	Favor Mount & Favor Servant - Save Info "Yes (harmless)" has to be wrong.
#	Feather Step seems wrong with No saving throw or Spell resistance, even with (harmless)
#	Foggy Flying carpet is missing Target/Area/Effect
#	Lasting Breath - Save info "Yes (harmless)" ???  Which one?
#	Lifeleech - Shouldn't it have Descriptor Evil?
#	Lost Wanderer - Save info "None or Will negates (harmless) - from description, more like Will negates, period.
#		- Same with Spell Resistance, should be Yes
#	Luck of the Saints - Shouldn't it be Spell Resistance Yes (harmless) similar to Save info?
#	Mage Armor, Greater - no (D) on duration?
#	Malicious Intent & Greater - Range 60 feet, but lists as 30 ft. radius spread centered on caster??  So, 30 or 60?
#	Mangling Foot - Cast time - One full round, or 1 standard action?
#	Massmorph into Trees - No max Duration, just concentration?
#	Open Trail - no maximum duration?
#		- No Save info or Spell resistance
#	Plant Door - Why (Harmless) on Save info and Spell Resist, if None and no?
#	Pocket Paradise - Save and Spell resistance should match (either harmless or not)
#	Protection from Pressure - Save info and Spell Res - No (harmless) ??
#	Scorching - 1 round, or Instantaneous?? - based on description, sounds like Instantaneous
#	Slimeball - Arcane level 4, Domain 7?  4 level spread?
#	Song of Vengeance - Shouldn't it be Range: 0 ft.?  has area of effect (and spell resistance).
#	Storm of Vitriol - The Spell reistances [Yes/No] is confusing, not sure if it is wrong.
#	Transmute Gold to Steel - Shouldn't it be Instantaneous, instead of permanent - no mention of how to undo, like Transmute Dust to Water, etc.

# Changes from source:
