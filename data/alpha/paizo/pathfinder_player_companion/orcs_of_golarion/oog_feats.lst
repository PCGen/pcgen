### Block: Feats
# Feat Name			Type				Required Ability																		Restricted AL		Required Class				Required Race			Required Stat	Description																												Source Page		Description of the Benefits
Aplified Rage		TYPE:Teamwork		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage																							PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:When adjacent to other raging allies, your rages become even more powerful.																SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:Whenever you are raging and adjacent to a raging ally who also has this feat, your morale bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by +4. This feat does not stack with itself (you only gain this bonus from one qualifying ally, regardless of how many are adjacent to you).
Blood Vengeance		TYPE:General																																PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:Seeing an ally fall in combat fills you with a murderous fury.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:Whenever one of your worthy allies is brought to negative hit points or killed, you may enter a state similar to but less powerfull than a barbarian's rage as a free action on your turn. If you have the rage class feature and are already raging, your morale bonuses to Strength and Constitution increate by +2 for the duration of your rage. If you do not have the rage class feature, or you have no more rage rounds left, this weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2, and this state lasts for 4 rounds. As with a barbarian's rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued; if another ally falls before this duration ends, the weaker rage lasts for 4 more rounds after that. This feat does not allow you to enter a rage if you are fatigued. You may only use this feat if the fallen ally had at least as many Hit Dice as you.
Brutal Grappler		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork																															PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:When helping an ally grapple, you can damage the target.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:When you and an ally with this feat have grappled the same creature, you may attempt to damage the opponent on your turn (whether you were the one who first initiated the grapple or were assisting your ally in doing so). You and the ally are treated as aiding each other in the grapple (+2 bonus on your grapple combat maneuver) as long as you both decide to maintain the grapple.
Ferocious Tenacity	TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Orc Ferocity ~ Half-Orc,Ferocity											PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:You spit in the face of death.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:When raging, if you are hit by an attack that would deal enough hit points of damage to kill you (negative hit points equal to your Constitution score), as an immediate action you may expend 1 or more rounds of rage to negate some of this damage and keep yourself alive. Each round of rage you spend reduces the attack's damage by your raging Constitution bonus, but cannot reduce the damage taken below 1 hit point.
Gore Fiend			TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage																							PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:Horrible wounds, wheter on yourself or your enemies, makes your blood sing.																SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When you are raging and you confirm a critical hit with a melee weapon or suffer a critical hit yourself (whether by a melee weapon, spell or ranged weapon), you regain 1 round of rage.
Sympathetic Rage		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage																							PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:Seeing an ally enter a rage causes you to enter a rage-like state																		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less powerful rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can rage, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain your rage). As with a barbarian's rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued.
Thrill of the Kill	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage																							PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:Killing fuels your rage																									SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When you are raging and your attack brings an enemy to negative hit points or kills them, you regain 1 round of rage. You may only use this feat if the fallen enemy had at least as many Hit Dice as you.
Warleader's Rage		TYPE:General																						!PREALIGN:LG,LN,LE							PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc	PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	DESC:Your rages are so inspiring to your allies that they don't have to remain adjacent to you to stay raging.											SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:Feats and abilities that allow an ally to rage or enhance a rage if adjacent to you (such as Amplified Rage and Sympathetic Rage) persist as long as your ally is within 30 feet of you and can see you. The conditions to activate the rage effect remain unchanged. For example, an ally with Sympathetic Rage must be adjacent to you to enter his own rage, but once his rage begins, he can continue raging as long as he can see you and you are within 30 feet.

### Block: worship feats
# There is no "Destroyer" god written out in this book. The feats requires the worshipping of "The Destroyer" god, but we'll leave this to the description. Similarly, there is no "Fire God".
Destroyer's Blessing	TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage																							PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:Breaking things adds to your power																							SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:When you are raging and you succeed at a sunder attempt, you regain 1 round of rage. If the sunder attempt causes the object to gain the broken condition, you heal 1 hit point. You must worship the Destroyer in order to choose this feat.
Fire God's Blessing	TYPE:General																																PRERACE:1,Orc,RACESUBTYPE=Orc				DESC:The Fire God rewards you for killing enemies with flame.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When in combat, if you deal fire damage to an enemy, you heal 1 hit point. You can only benefit from this healing once per round. Attacks that case a target to catch on fire heal you each round the target takes fire damage. You must worship the Fire God in order to choose this feat.

# amaitland: "You might be best served using just the text as some of that is quite a bit complicated to code up without a bit of work... however, it can be done."
# TODO: this type of channel energy cannot be enhanced by feats nor can it now act as a prereq to feats, such as command undead.
Adept Channel		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Arcane Bond ~ Familiar														PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=4						PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	DESC:Some orc adepts enjoy greater connection to their gods and can channel their faith through their unholy symbols. You gain the ability to channel energy as a cleric.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:You gain the channel energy class feature, as a cleric, usable 2 times per day. This ability otherwise functions like the cleric's channel energy ability, except that your effective cleric level is equal to your divine spellcasting class level -3. Unlike a cleric, however, the number of times per day you may channel energy is not affected by your Charisma modifier.
