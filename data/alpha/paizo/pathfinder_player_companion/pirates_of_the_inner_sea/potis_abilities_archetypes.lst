Buccaneers are flashy, debonair pirates who enjoy the excitement and rewards of piracy, but prefer not to kill; they are welcome on ships whose captains prefer to avoid the punishments that murder would bring or who lack the heart to strike down civilians in cold blood. Buccaneers are also popular in privateer crews - and among slave traders.

Sometimes a smuggler's cargo is illegal goods, such as drugs or slaves. Other times, a smuggler hides legal goods to avoid paying duties or taxes, and some may even use their abilities to help smuggle escaped slaves to freedom. Smugglers may work on a ship that does nothing but smuggle goods from one port to another, or they may freelance, working on ships that require a smuggler's services for a short time.
