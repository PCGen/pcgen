###Block: Ghost abilities
# Ability Name	Category of Ability		Type										Description																																			Source Page		Description of the Benefits
Rejuvenation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days.															SOURCEPAGE:p.145	BENEFIT:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.
Corrupting Gaze	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.GhostAbility.AttackOption.Supernatural	DESC:The ghost is disfigured through age or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage).	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	BENEFIT:The ghost is disfigured through age or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage).
Corrupting Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.GhostAbility.AttackOption.Supernatural	DESC:By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost inflicts %1d6 damage.|CR																SOURCEPAGE:p.144	BENEFIT:All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost inflicts %1d6 damage. This damage is not negative energy--it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.|CR
Draining Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.GhostAbility.AttackOption.Supernatural	DESC:The ghosts touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects on a hit.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.144	BENEFIT:The ghost died while insane or diseased. It gains a touch attack that drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects on a hit. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. When a ghost makes a draining touch attack, it cannot use its standard ghostly touch attack.
Frightful Moan	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.GhostAbility.AttackOption.Supernatural	DESC:The ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.144	BENEFIT:The ghost died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours.
Malevolence		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.GhostAbility.AttackOption.Supernatural	DESC:The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.144	BENEFIT:The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours.
Telekinesis		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.GhostAbility.AttackOption.Supernatural	DESC:The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.144	BENEFIT:The ghost's death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher).

Rejuvenation	KEY:Rejuvenation ~ Lich		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby.																SOURCEPAGE:p.189										BENEFIT:When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days--if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body), usually with a burning need for revenge against those who previously destroyed it.
Fear Aura		KEY:Fear Aura ~ Lich		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Aura	DEFINE:LichFearAuraDC|10+(TL/2)+CHA			DESC:Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or become frightened.

Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, DC %1). The effect cannot be dispelled.

On nights when the full moon is visible, an afflicted lycanthrope gains a +5 morale bonus to Constitution checks made to assume animal or hybrid form, but a -5 penalty to Constitution checks made to assume humanoid form.

Blood Drain			KEY:Blood Drain ~ Vampire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage.																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Children of the Night	KEY:Children of the Night ~ Vampire	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action.																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
Create Spawn		KEY:Create Spawn ~ Vampire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type.																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.
Dominate			KEY:Dominate ~ Vampire			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action.																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature types with this power.
Energy Drain		KEY:Energy Drain ~ Vampire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels.																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.271											BENEFIT:A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels.

SOURCEPAGE:p.271	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(dire bat or wolf, beast shape II)
Gaseous Form		KEY:Gaseous Form ~ Vampire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

SOURCEPAGE:p.271
Vampire Weaknesses							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Weakness					DESC:Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure. Immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to 1/3 of its maximum hit points. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it.	SOURCEPAGE:p.270											BENEFIT:Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire--they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points--a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.
