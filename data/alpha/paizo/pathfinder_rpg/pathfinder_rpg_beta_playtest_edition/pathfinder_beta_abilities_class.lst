Woodland Stride				KEY:Woodland Stride ~ Ranger						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyMovement	VISIBLE:YES								DESC:A ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Swift Tracker														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				VISIBLE:YES								DESC:A ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Quarry															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AttackOption		VISIBLE:YES								DESC:A ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can end this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If his quarry is killed, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour. This ability does not confer the ability to know whether or not the quarry is still alive. The ranger must see proof that his quarry has been killed to select another after 1 hour.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Camouflage															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				VISIBLE:YES								DESC:A ranger can use the Stealth skill to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Hide in Plain Sight													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				VISIBLE:YES								DESC:While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Improved Quarry														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AttackOption		VISIBLE:YES								DESC:A ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action. He can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Master Hunter														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AttackOption		VISIBLE:YES								DESC:A ranger can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die (DC %1).A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.|20+WIS																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.38

Resiliency							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RogueTalent			VISIBLE:YES																DESC:Once per day, a rogue with this ability can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the rogue's level. Activating this ability is an immediate action that can only be performed when she is brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent her from dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

Crippling Strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AdvancedRogueTalent.AttackOption	VISIBLE:YES															DESC:A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Defensive Roll	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AdvancedRogueTalent			VISIBLE:YES															DESC:The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll--if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.41

If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.41
