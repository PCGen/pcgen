# These EQMODs are used for adding charges to items which are not associated with a spell effect.
# Its set to VISIBLE:NO because this would only be called from an item and so should not be available in the customizer.
# The COST modifies the base items cost by the number of charges it has left, when fully charged the items base COST is unchanged, at half the number of charges the items price is half its listed value, etc...
# There is a CHOOSE tag in the line because I found that the checkboxes would not display on the OS unless its there.
# The NAMEOPT:SPELL prevents the number of charges from being tacked on to the name of the item unless there is less than the maximum number of charges.
# With this EQMOD in place one only needs to add this line to any item which needs 10 charges:

# EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_10|CHARGES[10]
