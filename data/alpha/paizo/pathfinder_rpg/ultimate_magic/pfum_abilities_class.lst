This arcane pool has %1 points. The pool refreshes once per day when you prepare your spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are holding a +%2 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.|MagusArcanePool|MagusArcanePoolBonus	DESC:These bonuses can be also used to add any of the following weapon properties: Dancing, Flaming, Flaming Burst, Frost, Icy Burst, Keen, Shock, Shocking Burst, Speed, or Vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends.|PREVARGTEQ:MagusArcanePoolLVL,5																																																												BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePool|max(floor(MagusArcanePoolLVL/2),1)+INT	BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePoolBonus|min(1+((MagusArcanePoolLVL-1)/4),5)	SOURCEPAGE:p.9		ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|MagusArcanePool	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1/day)|MagusArcanePool
Cantrips			KEY:Cantrips ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																				DESC:You can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.

Spell Combat		KEY:Spell Combat Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action  (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Spellstrike			KEY:Spellstrike ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:Whenever you cast a spell with a range of "touch" from the magus spell list, you can deliver the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.

For each point you expend, you can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in your spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If you do not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time you prepares spells, you lose those spells. You can also cast spells added in this way using your spell recall ability, but only until you prepares spells again.

The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. Furthermore, instead of recalling a used spell, as a swift action you can prepare a spell of the same level that you have in your spellbook. You do so by expending a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). You cannot apply metamagic feats to a spell prepared in this way.

True Magus			KEY:True Magus ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You are a master of spells and combat.

As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon without penalty. You can also cast any spell with a casting time of 1 standard action from the magus spell list.

You don not need to make a concentration check to cast the spell defensively. You must have one hand free to use this ability, even if the spell being cast does not contain somatic components. Whenever you use spell combat and your spell targets the same creature as your melee attacks, you can choose to either increase the DC to resist the spell by +2, grant yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on any checks made to overcome spell resistance, or grant yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made against the target during your turn.

Alchemical Simulacrum		KEY:Discovery ~ Alchemical Simulacrum		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																		PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),8																													DESC:You gain the ability to create a lesser simulacrum.  This works like the lesser simulacrum spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed.  The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatual effect.

Alchemical Zombie			KEY:Discovery ~ Alchemical Zombie			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																		PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),8																													DESC:You gain the ability to animate a relatively complete corpse as an alchemy-powered zombie.  This process takes 1 hour and costs 100 gp in alchemical reagents per HD of the corpse being animated; the dead creature gains the zombie template.  Zombies that are created in this manner count as undead created by Animate Dead for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control.  The created zombie is a creature, not a supernatural effect.

Blinding Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Blinding Bomb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																		PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),8																													DESC:When you create a bomb, you can choose for it to detonate very brightly.  Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.  Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute.  This is a light effect.

Bottled Ooze			KEY:Discovery ~ Bottled Ooze				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																		PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),6																						DEFINE:BottledOozeDuration|0			DESC:You have learned how to preserve a sample of oozes in a sealed bottle, which you can prepare for use as an extract.  When you activate the extract, you actually throw the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the ooze, which reconstitutes and attacks the closest creature.  The ooze is not under your control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature.  The ooze remains for %1 rounds, and decays into powder when the duration expires.  If you have the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen.  Creating a bottled ooze requires an extract with a level equal to the ooze's CR.|BottledOozeDuration																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|BottledOozeDuration|classlevel("Alchemist")+charbonusto("PCLEVEL","Alchemist")																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Cognatogen				KEY:Discovery ~ Cognatogen				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																																																					DESC:You gain the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score.  If the cognatogen enhances your Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime you would prepare a mutagen, you may instead prepare a cognatogen. All limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same substance-you can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a time, a cognatogen that is not in your possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens.

Confusion Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Confusion Bomb			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																		PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),8																						DEFINE:ConfusionBombDuration|0		DESC:Your bombs twist the target's perception of friend and foe. A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb and is under the effect of a Confusion spell for %1 rounds. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead).|ConfusionBombDuration																																																																																																																																																				BONUS:VAR|ConfusionBombDuration|classlevel("Alchemist")+charbonusto("PCLEVEL","Alchemist")																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Doppelganger Simulacrum		KEY:Discovery ~ Doppelganger Simulacrum		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Alchemical Simulacrum						PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),10																													DESC:You learn how to create a simulacrum, a soulless duplicate of your body, into which you can project your consciousness. As a full-round action, you may shift your consciousness from your current body to any one of your available doppelganger simulacra, which must be on the same plane as the alchemist. If killed in a simulacrum, you transfer to your own body automatically; if killed in your own body, you are dead. Unused simulacra (including your abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses, though they do not decay. Creating a duplicate costs 1,000 gp in alchemical materials and requires 1 week to grow. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatual effect.

Grand Cognatogen			KEY:Discovery ~ Grand Cognatogen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Greater Cognatogen						PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),16																													DESC:Your cognatogen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third mental ability score. You take a -2 penalty to your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as long as the cognatogen persists, and take 2 points of ability damage to each physical ability score when the cognatogen ends.

This works like the simulacrum spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.

You take a -2 penalty on both associated physical ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, and take 2 points of ability damage to both associated physical ability scores when the cognatogen ends.

Healing Touch			KEY:Discovery ~ Healing Touch				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Spontaneous Healing,Spontaneous Healing ~ Alchemist	PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),6																													DESC:You gain the ability to heal other creatures. As a standard action, you may touch a creature and apply 1 round's effect of your spontaneous healing discovery to that creature; this counts toward your spontaneous healing limit for the day. Your daily limit for hit points healed by spontaneous healing increases to 5 times your alchemist level. This ability only functions if the target is the same type of creature (humanoid, undead, and so on) as you.

Lingering Spirit			KEY:Discovery ~ Lingering Spirit			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																		PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),4																													DESC:You are familiar enough with the ties between your body and spirit that you linger at death's door far longer than a normal person. You treat your Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when hit point damage kills you.  Reducing you to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes you unconscious and comatose, but you are only killed after taking an additional 5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect, you must be brought to -5 Constitution in order to be killed by these attacks).

Mummification			KEY:Discovery ~ Mummification				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Preserve Organs							PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),10																													DESC:You have mastered preserving flesh and applied this knowledge to your own body, turning yourself into an undeadlike creature. After learning this discovery, you must perform a 30-day regimen of a special diet, rigorous exercise, and drinking a mildly poisonous alchemical tea. At the end of this regimen, you fall unconscious for 24 hours, then awaken as a "living mummy." Your type does not change, but you become immune to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep.

Parasitic Twin			KEY:Discovery ~ Parasitic Twin			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																		PREVARGTEQ:count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=Special Ability","NAME=Vestigal Arm"),2																						DESC:Your vestigial limbs are part of a parasitic twin on your torso, consisting of a head, a torso, and two arms (from the vestigial limb discovery). Normally, the twin is mostly recessed within your body, with the visible arms acting like the vestigial arm discovery, though you can manifest or hide the twin as a standard action. The twin is helpless, fully subservient to you, and cannot be targeted or harmed. Once per day, if you succumb to a mental effect that would make you unconscious, helpless, or not in control of your own actions (such as charm person, feeblemind, or hold person), you can reroll your saving throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and you can ignore it. Using this ability sickens you for the duration of the absorbed effect (removing the effect from the twin ends the sickened condition), and you cannot use the twin's limbs during that time, though passive effects (such as from rings worn on the vestigial arms) continue normally.

When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a %1%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This does not stack with similar abilities that negate critical hits and sneak attacks (such as fortification armor).|25*count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=Special Ability","NAME=Preserve Organs")																																																																																																									STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.17

As a free action once per round, you can heal 5 hit points as if you had the fast healing ability. You can heal %1 hit points per day in this manner. If you fall unconscious because of hit point damage and you still have healing available from this ability, the ability activates automatically each round until you are conscious again or the ability is depleted for the day.|SpontaneousHealingAmount																																																																																																																																									BONUS:VAR|SpontaneousHealingAmount|floor(classlevel("Alchemist")/2)*5																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Strafe Bomb				KEY:Discovery ~ Strafe Bomb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																																																					DESC:You can throw bombs that splash in a 40-foot line rather than affecting a radius. The line starts at you and extends away from you in the direction you choose. You designate one creature in the squares affected by the line to be the target of the bomb and make your attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the line take splash damage. If you have the explosive bomb discovery and throw an explosive strafe bomb, the line of splash damage is 80 feet long instead of 40 feet.																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Sunlight Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Sunlight Bomb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Blinding Bomb							PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),10																													DESC:You can throw bombs that explode with a searing radiance equivalent to that of sunlight and that act as blinding bombs. Undead, fungi, molds, oozes, slimes, and creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take +2 damage per die from the bomb. Undead that are harmed by sunlight and that fail their saves against the bomb are staggered for 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Tanglefoot Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Tanglefoot Bomb			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																																																					DESC:A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save against the bomb's DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a tanglefoot bag (see page 160 of the Core Rulebook). Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all.																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Tentacle				KEY:Discovery ~ Tentacle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																																																					DESC:You gain a prehensile, arm-length tentacle on your body. The tentacle is fully under your control and cannot be concealed except with magic or bulky clothing. The tentacle does not give you any extra attacks or actions per round, though you can use it to make a tentacle attack (1d4 damage for a Medium alchemist, 1d3 damage for a Small one) with the grab ability (see page 301 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). The tentacle can manipulate or hold items as well as your original arms can (for example, allowing you to use one hand to wield a weapon, the tentacle to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb). Unlike an arm, the tentacle has no magic item slots.

Tumor Familiar			KEY:Discovery ~ Tumor Familiar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																																														DEFINE:FMLevel|classlevel("Alchemist")	DESC:You create a Diminutive or Tiny tumor on your body, usually on your back or stomach. As a standard action, you can have the tumor detach itself from your body as a separate creature vaguely resembling a kind of animal suitable for a familiar (bat, cat, and so on) and move about as if it were an independent creature. The tumor can reattach itself to you as a standard action. The tumor has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a batlike tumor can fly) and familiar abilities based on your caster level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to an alchemist). The tumor acts as your familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill bonus, the Alertness feat, and so on). When attached to you, the tumor has fast healing 5. Your extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

The arm is fully under your control and cannot be concealed except with magic or bulky clothing. The arm does not give you any extra attacks or actions per round, though the arm can wield a weapon and make attacks as part of your attack routine (using two-weapon f ighting). The arm can manipulate or hold items as well as your original arms (for example, allowing the alchemist to use one hand to wield a weapon, another hand to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb). The arm has its own "hand" and "ring" magic item slots (though the alchemist can still only wear two rings and two hand magic items at a time).

These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. You can select this discovery multiple times; each time you do so, you add your caster level to the number of minutes per day that you can fly with the wings.

SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:This haunting melody teases at the veils of understanding and drills into the bedrock of truth. Upon completing this performance, the target attempts a Will save (DC %1). Failure means you understand the target's primal nature; you gain a +4 bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence the target, and the DCs of your abilities and spells that would influence the creature or its actions (including charm and compulsion effects) increase by +2. These bonuses last for 1 day. You must have an idea of who the creature is when you begin to play the song, either through researching the creature or by observing it directly from no farther than 100 feet.  Use: 5 rounds of bardic performance.  Action: 5 full rounds.|AtTheHeartOfItAllDC

SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:This quick dance is a series of small steps culminating in a series of leaps. When you complete the performance, for the next 10 minutes you treat any distance fallen as if it were %2 feet shorter. You may spend the first minute of this effect demonstrating the dance to up to %3 creatures; if these students succeed at a DC 15 Perform (dance) check, they also gain the benefits of this masterpiece for the remainder of its duration.

When using this masterpiece, you take a -%1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you must make a concentration check to cast any spell (DC 15 + the spell's level), but you gain a +%1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. You can combine this masterpiece with fighting defensively and Combat Expertise, but not total defense. When you use this masterpiece, it lasts until the start of your next turn. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide ) affect this masterpiece; this allows you to get multiple rounds of its benefit (and its penalties) at the cost of only 1 round of bardic performance.  Use: 1 bardic performance round.  Action: 1 free action.|DanceOf23StepsModifier
Depths of the Mountain				KEY:Masterpiece ~ Depths of the Mountain				OUTPUTNAME:The Depths of the Mountain			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:Your drumming skills can break solid rock.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:Like a singer shattering a wine glass with a perfect note, your music cracks stone, shivering solid rock until it snaps. When you complete the performance, you create a tremor identical to an earthquake spell. For each round you continue to expend bardic performance rounds, the area experiences a round-long aftershock, which has the following effects.  Caves, Caverns, or Tunnels: Smaller collapses cause 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 5 half) and pin any creatures caught inside.  Cliffs: More cliffs crumble, creating a landslide that travels half as far horizontally as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 5 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble.  Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 5 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%% chance of falling into one (Reflex DC 10 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 20 feet deep, and these fissures remain open at the end of the quake.  Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned by the effects of the aftershock takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, she must make a DC 5 Constitution check or take 1d3 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.  Rivers, Lakes, or Marshes: The area drained away by the earthquake remains drained for the duration of the aftershock.  Spellcasting: The concentration DC to cast during an aftershock is 15 + the spell's level.  Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 50 points of damage. A collapsing structure deals 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures inside it (Reflex DC 5 half), and the creatures inside are pinned beneath the rubble.  Use: 10 rounds of bardic performance, +1 round for each round of aftershocks.  Action: 10 full rounds.

SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:This pantomime tells the tale of Gorroc, a foolish farmer who failed to control the weeds that grew so quickly upon his land. In desperation, Gorroc bargained with a devil, who blasted the earth with salt and withering heat, leaving the fertile land desolate for a century. When you complete the performance, you can create a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line that is blasted with scorching air and hot salt. Plants and oozes in this area take %1d%2 points of damage; half this damage is fire damage, half is piercing damage. A Reflex save (DC %3) reduces the damage by half. Creatures other than plants or oozes take half damage, or no damage on a successful save.  Use: 2 bardic performance rounds.  Action: 1 full round.|DumbshowOfGorrocDamageDice|DumbshowOfGorrocDamageDieSize|DumbshowOfGorrocDC
House of Imaginary Walls			KEY:Masterpiece ~ House of Imaginary Walls			OUTPUTNAME:The House of Imaginary Walls			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:HouseOfImaginaryWallsDC|10+(classlevel("Bard")/2)+CHA																		DESC:You can trap opponents with the power of your acting.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You silently mime building an invisible wall, flattening your hands along linear planes to indicate its location and orientation. This "wall" is only real for creatures that see you perform this masterpiece (Will negates, DC %1); you and your allies may automatically fail your saves if you want to treat the wall as real (for example, if you want to use the wall as a bridge to cross a chasm). For creatures who believe the wall is real, it has hardness 8, 90 hit points, and a break DC of 30 (multiple believing creatures can attack the walls, breaking through it more quickly as if they were all attacking a real wall rather than each attacking separate mental constructs). This is an illusion (phantasm) effect. Because the wall is a mental image, it blocks incorporeal creatures that fail their saves (because they perceive it as a magical barrier that excludes them), though they can still go around the wall or through the floor or ceiling to bypass it. It does not affect objects or creatures immune to mental effects (which can result in situations like an archer firing through the wall but unable to physically cross it). You can create one 10-foot-square wall per use of this ability; over several rounds you can extend this square or create other walls, all of which persist until you stop using bardic performance rounds to sustain them. The wall is immobile once created. Part of the wall must be in or along the edge of your space, and you cannot create a wall that extends beyond your natural reach (though you can create a wall, move, and create another by using this ability again). Once created, the wall exists until you end your performance or affected creatures "break" it. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide) affect this masterpiece.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.  Action: 1 standard action per 10-foot square.|HouseOfImaginaryWallsDC
Legato Piece on the Infernal Bargain	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Legato Piece on the Infernal Bargain										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:Your skilled playing can conjure up supernatural servants.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:This fast-paced tune harmonizes with the magical frequencies of another plane, allowing you to draw an extraplanar creature to you and bargain for its service. When you complete this performance, you call one or more outsiders as if using planar ally. Unlike with planar ally, the creature is not necessarily associated with your deity, and has an initial attitude of "indifferent" toward you. Because it is intrigued by your performance, it remains for up to 1 minute to hear the service you are requesting and the payment you are offering. If you succeed at an opposed Charisma check against the creature (with a +0 to +6 bonus on your roll based on the nature of the service and the offered reward), it agrees to perform the service. This ability otherwise works like planar ally. Though the best-known version of this masterpiece refers to an infernal bargain, it can be used to conjure any sort of extraplanar creature (such as an archon, elemental, or protean). Other versions and arrangements of this masterpiece may have different names but otherwise identical effects.  Use: 10 bardic performance rounds.  Action: 10 minutes.

SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:When you activate this soothing performance, one target within close range falls asleep as if affected by deep slumber (DC %1) as long as you maintain the performance. Unlike the spell (which affects weaker creatures first), this masterpiece targets a specific creature of your choice. Although this lullaby does have words, it is not a language-dependent effect.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.  Action: 1 round.|LullabyOfEmberTheAncientDC

SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:As ivy climbs walls and spills across even the rockiest and most uneven of terrain, so too does your dance propel you across broken stone and up walls. As long as you maintain the performance, whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain; this allows you to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain. As long as you move laterally at least 10 feet, you may climb as if you had a climb speed equal to your base speed. You may spend the first round of this performance demonstrating the dance to up to %1 creatures; if these students succeed at a DC 15 Perform (dance) check, they also gain the benefits of this masterpiece as long as you maintain the performance.

SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You create a musical tempo that first mirrors your enemies' heartbeats, and then quickens them to dangerous levels. When you complete the performance, all enemies within 30 feet who can hear your performance must save (DC %1) or take 1d6 points of damage as their pounding heart causes them to sweat blood. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are unaffected by this ability. Each round that you continue the performance adds another round to the bleed effect. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide) affect this masterpiece.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of bleed.  Action: 1 standard action.|QuickeningPulseDC
Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King		KEY:Masterpiece ~ Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King		OUTPUTNAME:The Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:Your performance reveals ways to cheat time itself.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:This piece tells the story of a mighty priest-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next 10 minutes. When you perform this masterpiece, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to perform a nonmagical action that normally requires a move action or a standard action. For example, you could make a full attack, then spend a swift action to take a normal move, load a light crossbow, or draw a weapon in the same round. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the masterpiece; otherwise the benefit is lost. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase your speed (such as haste) or alter time (such as time stop). Your allies may benefit from this masterpiece, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance, and you must expend 1 round of bardic performance for each ally other than yourself whom you want to gain the ability to accelerate time (for example, affecting yourself and five others requires expending 11 rounds of bardic performance). This is a language-dependent effect.  Use: 5 bardic performance rounds, +1 round per additional person affected.  Action: 1 minute.
Stone Face						KEY:Masterpiece ~ Stone Face															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:Your antics can soften even the hardest visage.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You tell an old and humorous tale about a woman who refused to smile at anything, no matter how funny. Through a series of increasingly unlikely events involving a cart of horse manure, a king, and a flying carpet, her legendary frown broke at last. When you complete the performance, the target is affected by stone to flesh.  Use: 2 bardic performance rounds.  Action: 1 minute.
Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:ToccataAndFugueOfTheDanseMacabreTargets|classlevel("Bard")																		DESC:Your spooky music blurs the boundaries between life and death, confusing the senses of undead creatures.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:The complex notes and layered repetitions of this masterpiece bring to mind the countless dead of ages past and suffuse those who listen to it with a subtle melancholia and grim acceptance of the temporary nature of life. Starting with a trio of notes, repeated frequently and with ever-greater insistence, it becomes a whirling, head-spinning vortex of sound. Upon completing the performance, you and up to %1 allies within listening range become hidden from undead, as if under the effects of a hide from undead spell. As with hide from undead, one creature breaking the effect ends the benefit of the performance for all recipients. But by spending an additional round of bardic performance when you perform or maintain the masterpiece, you can dedicate a refrain to a particular ally; even if one ally breaks the hide from undead effect, the ally receiving the dedication remains hidden so long as he does not break the effect himself. You can dedicate a refrain multiple times in the performance (up to once per round) as long as you spend 1 round of bardic performance each time for the ally receiving a dedication.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of the performance, +1 round per ally affected, +1 round per dedicated refrain.  Action: 1 minute.|ToccataAndFugueOfTheDanseMacabreTargets
Triple Time						KEY:Masterpiece ~ Triple Time															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:TripleTimeTargets|classlevel("Bard")																					DESC:Your lively cadence puts a spring in the step of weary marchers.																													BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Walk|10|PREAPPLY:ANYPC										SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:This bright and spritely tune mimics the sound of human feet, slowly building to a steady, ground-eating pace. When you complete this performance, you affect %1 allies in hearing range. This masterpiece increases the affected target's base land speed by 10 feet for 1 hour. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).  Use: 1 bardic performance round.  Action: 1 minute.|TripleTimeTargets
Winds of the Five Heavens			KEY:Masterpiece ~ Winds of the Five Heavens			OUTPUTNAME:The Winds of the Five Heavens			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:You control the wind by telling a tale demonstrating the hubris of mortals.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:This short monologue tells the story of a village priest who thought to command the gods. This so annoyed the gods of the weather that they gave him exactly what he wished for, and the priest's long-winded sermons tore apart his temple and scattered his parishioners. When you complete the performance, you conjure a great wind as if you had cast control winds.  Use: 3 bardic performance round.  Action: 3 full rounds.

You can project your senses from that animal to another within 100 feet of it as a standard action, and can continue to make these sensory leaps, potentially viewing things very far from your actual location. You may return your senses to your own body as a free action. Normal animals get no saving throw against this ability, but animal companions, paladin mounts, and similar unusual animals may resist with a Will save; you may use this ability on your own familiar as if it were an animal. If you have the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet of you who also have the coven hex can see through this animal at will, although you still control the ability.

Before using the hex, you must spend 1 day pacing out the border of an area that measures roughly 40,000 square feet (approximately 200 feet by 200 feet) to define your home territory. Thereafter, you can use the hex to change the appearance of that area as a standard action as long as you are within the area. The illusion persists until you change or dismiss it.

If the target fails its save, it is paralyzed and unconscious but does not need to eat or breathe while the ice lasts. The ice has 20 hit points; destroying the ice frees the creature, which is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being released. Whether or not the target's saving throw is successful, it cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.

Grand Hex - Dire Prophecy	KEY:Dire Prophecy ~ WitchGrandHex	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.WitchHex.GrandHex											PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,18	DEFINE:DireProphecyEndPenalty|WitchLVL										DESC:You curse the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As long as the curse persists, the target takes a -4 penalty to his Armor Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, you may end it by bringing its full force upon your victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty of -%1 to his Armor Class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. You must decide to apply this penalty before the roll to be modified is made. If you do not have line of sight to the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger. A target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time. Whether or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex for 1 day. This is a curse effect.|DireProphecyEndPenalty										SOURCEPAGE:p.82

To seal an agreement with you, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in your service; you can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.

The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. You can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using your Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by you, even obeying commands such as "follow me from 100 feet away"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until you dismiss it or you animate another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state.
