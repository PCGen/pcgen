Link				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:A master can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.52								BENEFIT:A master can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The master gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.
Share Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion instead of on herself.															SOURCEPAGE:p.52								BENEFIT:The master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A master may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.

Deliver Touch Spells									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A familiar can deliver touch spells for the master.											SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.
Empathic Link										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Communicate	DESC:The master has an empathic link with his familiar.											SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link's limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.
Speak One Language									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice as a supernatural ability.					SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Spell Resistance				KEY:Spell Resistance ~ Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.									SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.
