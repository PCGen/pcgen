Your bombs also inflict an additional %4d%3 points of fire damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike.

You can use %1 bombs each day. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert - their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, you must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst - you can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day - once created, a catalyst vial remains usable for years. Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, your bomb inflicts 1d%2+%3 points of fire damage. Your bombs also inflict an additional %4d%2 points of fire damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike. Splash damage from an your bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (%5).

Brew Potion					KEY:Brew Potion ~ Alchemist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																						DESC:You receive Brew Potion as a bonus feat. You can brew potions of any formulae you know (up to 3rd level), using your alchemist level as caster level. The spell must be one that can be made into a potion.

Mutagen					KEY:Mutagen ~ Alchemist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DEFINE:AlchemistMutagenLVL|0	DEFINE:AlchemistMutagenDuration|0	DEFINE:AlchemistMutagenDC|0																																		DESC:You know how to create a mutagen that you can imbibe in order to heighten your physical prowess at the cost of your personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenDC																																		BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenLVL*10	BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDC|10+(AlchemistMutagenLVL/2)+INT																			SOURCEPAGE:p.27

###Block: Alchemist discoveries
# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type							Required Ability									Var. Min. Value			Description
Acid Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Acid Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.
Combine Extracts		KEY:Discovery ~ Combine Extracts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8	DESC:When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract.
Concentrate Poison	KEY:Discovery ~ Concentrate Poison	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:The alchemist can combine two doses of the same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison's frequency is extended by 50%% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.
Concussive Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Concussive Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.
Delayed Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Delayed Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8	DESC:The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel magic can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier).
Dilution			KEY:Discovery ~ Dilution		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	DESC:Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again.This discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens.
Dispelling Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Dispelling Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted dispel magic spell, using the alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
Elixir of Life		KEY:Discovery ~ Elixir of Life	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16	DESC:Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell true resurrection. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a resurrection spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end.
Enhance Potion		KEY:Discovery ~ Enhance Potion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.
Eternal Potion		KEY:Discovery ~ Eternal Potion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Extend Potion	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16	DESC:If an alchemist drinks a potion that he extends, the effects of that potion become permanent until he chooses to make another potion effect permanent.
Explosive Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Explosive Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a fullround action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.
Extend Potion		KEY:Discovery ~ Extend Potion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration. This does not apply to extracts.
Fast Bombs			KEY:Discovery ~ Fast Bombs		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8	DESC:An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon.
Feral Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Feral Mutagen		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate skill checks.
Force Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Force Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save.
Frost Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Frost Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.
Grand Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Grand Mutagen		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Greater Mutagen	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16	DESC:The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists (see Mutagen).
Greater Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Greater Mutagen	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	DESC:The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists.
Infuse Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Infuse Mutagen	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens - only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.
Inferno Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Inferno Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Smoke Bomb	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,16	DESC:The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicate the effects of incendiary cloud instead of fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.
Infusion			KEY:Discovery ~ Infusion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.
Madness Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Madness Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	DESC:The alchemist's bombs do more than sear flesh - they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage.
Poison Bomb*		KEY:Discovery ~ Poison Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Smoke Bomb	PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	DESC:The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of cloudkill instead of fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.
Precise Bombs		KEY:Discovery ~ Precise Bombs		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.
Shock Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Shock Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.
Smoke Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Smoke Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery																	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions as fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.
Sticky Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Sticky Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,10	DESC:The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later.
Sticky Poison		KEY:Discovery ~ Sticky Poison		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery												PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6	DESC:Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky - when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.
Stink Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Stink Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Smoke Bomb						DESC:The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb can duplicate the effects of stinking cloud instead of fog cloud, f illing an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.

A Medium cavalier can select a camel or a horse. A Small cavalier can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he is at least 4th level.

True Judgment							KEY:True Judgment ~ Inquisitor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																				DESC:An inquisitor can call true judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke true judgment on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the inquisitor can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must make a Fortitude save (DC %1) or die. Once the attack is made, all of the bonuses from the inquisitor's judgments reset to those granted on the first round (although the slayer judgment remains at the maximum bonus). Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the inquisitor's true judgment ability for 24 hours.|10+InquisitorLvl/2+WIS																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.41

Your eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except that it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to you, your eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. You can summon your eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, your eidolon's hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if your eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. Your eidolon remains until dismissed (a standard action).

In addition, you and your eidolon must remain within 100 feet of one another for your eidolon to remain at full strength. If your eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%%. If your eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%%. If your eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane.

Life Bond								KEY:Life Bond ~ Summoner				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																				DESC:Your life becomes linked to your eidolon's. As long as your eidolon has 1 or more hit points, you are protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce you to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to your eidolon.
