Inspiring Command				KEY:Inspiring Command ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A battle herald uses her keen tactical acumen and decisive judgment to lead others to victory, as well as her mastery of command to assist herself and her allies in battle. All battle heralds may use inspiring command to inspire courage (as the bardic performance ability); bard and battle herald levels stack to determine the bonuses provided by inspire courage. At 1st level, and every two levels thereafter, the battle herald chooses one command to learn. Unless otherwise noted, these abilities provide a competence bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to her and to all allies within 60 feet able to see or hear her. Commands marked with an asterisk have the same range as above but only affect a certain number of allies (which can include the battle herald). Issuing an inspiring command is a move action. At 5th level, this becomes a swift action, and at 10th level, it becomes an immediate action. Maintaining an inspiring command is a free action that cannot be disrupted, but its effects end immediately if the battle herald is killed or otherwise prevented from taking actions (such as being dazed, helpless, or stunned). The battle herald cannot have more than one command in effect at a time. She may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Charisma modifier, plus 2 additional rounds per level after 1st. She may use rounds of bardic performance to issue inspiring commands, but not vice versa. Inspiring commands are language-dependent, mind-affecting effects. The battle herald cannot maintain an inspiring command and a bardic performance at the same time (this does not preclude abilities such as persistent command or the Lingering Performance feat, which continue an inspiring command or bardic performance after the battle herald stops maintaining it).

Targeted allies who are poisoned may attempt a new poison saving throw with a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus; a failed save has no additional effect, but a successful save counts toward curing the poison. This healing is not positive energy and can heal undead creatures.

#
Improved Leadership			KEY:Improved Leadership ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A battle herald with the Leadership feat adds her inspiring command bonus to her leadership score.
Voice of Authority			KEY:Voice of Authority ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A battle herald is skilled at shouting commands over the din of the battlefield and signaling allies when speech is impossible. She gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks with creatures with which she shares a language. In addition, her allies gain a bonus equal to the battle herald's class level on Perception or Sense Motive checks to hear her commands or interpret her secret messages conveyed with Bluff. The battle herald's levels stack with cavalier levels for the purpose of the cavalier's tactician ability.
Easy March					KEY:Easy March ~ Battle Herald				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 2nd level, allies within 60 feet of the battle herald can hustle or force march during overland travel without ill effects for a number of hours per day equal to 1 hour times her inspiring command bonus.
Inspire Greatness				KEY:Inspire Greatness ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 4th level, a battle herald may use her inspiring command ability to inspire greatness (as the 9th-level bardic performance ability). This ability affects one creature at 4th level, two at 7th, and three at 10th.
Banner					KEY:Banner ~ Battle Herald					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 5th level, a battle herald may fly a battle standard that inspires her allies. This ability is identical to the cavalier's banner ability, and cavalier levels stack with battle herald levels to determine the bonuses provided by the banner.
Teamwork Feat				KEY:Teamwork Feat ~ Battle Herald				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extra																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 6th level, a battle herald receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat. She can use her cavalier tactician ability as a move action to grant this feat to allies (if she has the cavalier greater tactician ability, this is a swift action).
Demanding Challenge			KEY:Demanding Challenge ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:This ability is identical to the 12th-level cavalier demanding challenge ability.
Persistent Commands			KEY:Persistent Commands ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 8th level, a battle herald may allow her inspiring commands to persist even if she is incapacitated and unable to maintain them. If the player chooses, the effects of the battle herald's inspiring commands persist for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (these count toward her number of rounds per day limit). This ability does not apply if the battle herald intentionally stops maintaining an inspiring command-only if she is dazed, held, stunned, killed, and so on, and is unable to maintain them. If the battle herald recovers from incapacity while an inspiring command is ongoing, she may resume maintaining it as a free action.
Inspire Last Stand			KEY:Inspire Last Stand ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 9th level, a battle herald may use inspiring command to grant herself and all allies within 30 feet the benefits of the Diehard feat. Conscious affected creatures also gain the benefits of inspire courage while at negative hit points.
Complex Commands				KEY:Complex Commands ~ Battle Herald			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 10th level, a battle herald can have more than one command ability in effect at one time. Each must be begun separately and requires a separate maintenance cost. This allows the battle herald to have more than one single-target command (such as battle magic) in effect at the same time. The effects of multiple instances of the same command ability do not stack, even if the bonuses provided by that ability would normally stack (for example, if the battle herald maintains two pincer maneuver commands, her allies do not get double the bonus, even though dodge bonuses normally stack). The battle herald can also maintain one bardic performance in addition to her inspiring commands, though each must be begun separately and each requires its own maintenance cost.

# Holy Vindicator Abilities

Vindicator's Shield			KEY:Vindicator's Shield ~ Holy Vindicator			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A vindicator can channel energy into his shield as a standard action; when worn, the shield gives the vindicator a sacred bonus (if positive energy) or profane bonus (if negative energy) to his Armor Class equal to the number of dice of the vindicator's channel energy. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until the vindicator is struck in combat, whichever comes first. The shield does not provide this bonus to any other wielder, but the vindicator does not need to be holding the shield for it to retain this power.
Stigmata					KEY:Stigmata ~ Holy Vindicator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A vindicator willingly gives his blood in service to his faith, and is marked by scarified wounds appropriate to his deity. He may stop or start the flow of blood by force of will as a standard action; at 6th level it becomes a move action, and at 10th level it becomes a swift action. Activating stigmata causes bleed damage equal to half the vindicator's class level, and this bleed damage is not halted by curative magic. While the stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator gains a sacred bonus (if he channels positive energy) or profane bonus (if he channels negative energy) equal to half his class level. Each time he activates his stigmata, the vindicator decides if the bonus applies to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, Armor Class, caster level checks, or saving throws; to change what the bonus applies to, the vindicator must deactivate and reactivate his stigmata. While his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator ignores blood drain and bleed damage from any other source and can use bleed or stabilize at will as a standard action.
Faith Healing				KEY:Faith Healing ~ Holy Vindicator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 3rd level, any cure wounds spells a vindicator casts on himself are automatically empowered as if by the Empower Spell feat, except they do not use higher spell level slots or an increased casting time. If the vindicator targets himself with a cure spell that affects multiple creatures, this ability only applies to himself. At 8th level, these healing spells are maximized rather than empowered.
Divine Wrath				KEY:Divine Wrath ~ Holy Vindicator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 4th level, when a vindicator confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 1st-level spell or available 1st-level spell slot to invoke doom upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The save DC is increased by +2 if his weapon has a ?3 damage multiplier, or by +4 if it is ?4. The vindicator can also use this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator.
Bloodfire					KEY:Bloodfire ~ Holy Vindicator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 5th level, while a vindicator's stigmata are bleeding, his blood runs down his weapons like sacred or profane liquid energy; when he uses Channel Smite, the damage increases by 1d6, and if the target fails its save, it is sickened and takes 1d6 points of bleed damage each round on its turn. The target can attempt a new save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects.
Channel Smite				KEY:Channel Smite ~ Holy Vindicator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extra																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 5th level, a vindicator gains Channel Smite as a bonus feat.
Versatile Channel				KEY:Versatile Channel ~ Holy Vindicator			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 6th level, a vindicator's channel energy can instead affect a 30-foot cone or a 120-foot line.
Divine Judgment				KEY:Divine Judgment ~ Holy Vindicator			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 7th level, when a vindicator's melee attack reduces a creature to -1 or fewer hit points, he may sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell or available 2ndlevel spell slot to invoke death knell upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). As vindicators mete out divine judgment, this is not an evil act. The save DC increases by +2 if his weapon has a ?3 critical multiplier, or by +4 if it is ?4.
Bloodrain					KEY:Bloodrain ~ Holy Vindicator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 9th level, while his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator's harmful channeled energy is accompanied by a burst of sacred or profane liquid energy, increasing the damage by 1d6. Creatures failing their saves against the channeled energy become sickened and take 1d6 points of bleed damage each round. Affected creatures can attempt a new save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects.
Divine Retribution			KEY:Divine Retribution ~ Holy Vindicator			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 10th level, when a vindicator confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 3rdlevel spell or available 3rd-level spell slot to invoke bestow curse upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The save DC increases by +2 if his weapon has a ?3 critical multiplier, or by +4 if it is ?4. The vindicator can also use this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator.

# Horizon Walker Abilities
#
# NB: This took me a time to figure out, but we use the RangerFavoredTerrainLVL and HorizonWalkerFavoredTerrainLVL proxy
#     variable in case a new class would want to add levels to this class. Like where a Ranger used to behave as a
#     druid of four levels lower than a Druid for the Animal Companion class ability. There the Ranger would add
#     MAX(0,CL-4) to the Druid ability level.

Terrain Dominance (Plane, aligned)	KEY:TerrainDominancePlaneAligned				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.TerrainDominance			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TerrainMasteryPlaneAligned																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:For the purpose of bypassing damage reduction, the horizon walker's manufactured and natural weapons count as the opposite alignment of his chosen plane of dominance. If his chosen plane has more than one alignment type, he must choose one of those types for this ability. For example, if he selects "Hell" (an evil, lawful plane) for his terrain dominance ability, he may choose "evil" or "lawful," which means his attacks bypass good or chaotic damage reduction, respectively. Alternatively, if native creatures of his chosen plane are vulnerable to a particular special material (such as cold iron or silver), he may choose to have his weapons bypass damage reduction as if they were that special material. If he selects this plane more than once for his terrain dominance ability, his attacks count as an additional alignment or special material (such as "good and silver" or "chaotic and good").

Master of All Lands												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 10th level, the horizon walker becomes familiar with and comfortable in all possible terrains. His terrain bonus in all favored terrains increases by +2, and he treats all other terrains as if they were favored terrains (+2 bonus). If a naturally occurring condition of temperature or weather requires a check or saving throw, he automatically succeeds. All allies within 60 feet of him gain a +2 bonus on these checks and saves; if the horizon walker is in a mastered terrain, this bonus increases to +4.

# Master Chymist Abilities

Extracts per Day				KEY:Extracts per Day ~ Master Chymist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extra																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At the indicated levels, a master chymist gains new extracts per day as if she had also gained a level in alchemist. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for extracts per day and an increased effective caster level for extracts.
Bomb-Thrower				KEY:Bomb-Thrower ~ Master Chymist				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The destructive power of bombs appeals to the violent urges of a master chymist. Add the character's alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine the damage done by her bombs.
Mutagenic Form				KEY:Mutagenic Form ~ Master Chymist				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A master chymist's mutagenic form is an alter ego that has a different personality than her normal form, an outgrowth of the mental changes caused by the mutagenic potions she has consumed over the course of her career. The mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner. The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her normal form; they may look as different as two unrelated people. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name, and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds (though the alter ego's limited time in existence often makes this difficult). The mutagenic form even has his or her own alignment (which is selected by the player, but must be different from the master chymist's normal alignment). The change in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her mutagenic form. Example: Darabont is a neutral good gnome alchemist 7/master chymist 4. Her mutagenic form is a deformed, twisted creature called Butcher. Butcher is neutral, and more interested in seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest good. Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by Darabont, but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded friends during the hours she exists. Butcher does not dislike Darabont, but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in. As Darabont, the character detects as good and is affected as a good character by spells with effects that vary by alignment; as Butcher, the same character is neutral, is not revealed by a detect good spell, and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects.
Mutate					KEY:Mutate ~ Master Chymist					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 1st level, as a result of repeated exposure to her mutagens, the master chymist can now assume a mutagenic form twice per day without imbibing her mutagen. In this form, she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this form. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen's modifiers replacing the current modifiers, and the longer duration taking precedent). The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its duration expires, her magic is interrupted (as with an antimagic field), or she expends another use of her mutate ability. A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her will by stress or damage. Anytime the character is in her normal form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available, she may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save. In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25 Will save; if she fails, on her next turn she uses a standard action to change to her mutagenic form (which counts as a use of the mutate ability). At 5th level, the master chymist can assume her mutagenic form three times per day; this increases to four times per day at 8th level and five times per day at 10th level.
Advanced Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Master Chymist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 2nd level, the mutagenic form of the master chymist continues to evolve and develop as she grows in power. The master chymist selects an advanced mutagen, a power that changes how her mutagen form works or can only be accessed in her mutagenic form. She gains additional advanced mutagens at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level. The chymist cannot select the same advanced mutagen more than once.
#
Burly						KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Burly					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:In her mutagenic form, the master chymist's heavy physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on Strength checks, Constitution checks, and Strength-based skill checks as well as a bonus to CMB and CMD. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level.
Disguise					KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Disguise				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:When in her mutagenic form, the chymist can temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form. As a standard action, she may make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to assume the appearance of her normal form for one minute. Each additional minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1 increase to the DC. Failure means the chymist assumes her normal form (as if ending the use of mutagenic form) or reverts fully to her mutagenic form. At any time while using this ability, the chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action. Once this ability ends, the chymist cannot use it again until 10 minutes have passed. Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form such as draconic mutagen, feral mutagen, and growth mutagen do not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form. Time spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic form.
Draconic Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Draconic Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she gains dragon-like features- scaly skin, reptilian eyes, and so on, resembling a halfdragon. The chymist chooses one dragon type (see the draconic bloodline table on page 75 of the Core Rulebook) when selecting this advanced mutagen; once selected, this choice cannot be changed and determines her draconic resistances and breath weapon type. The chymist gains resistance 20 to the dragon's energy type. The chymist's breath weapon deals 8d8 points of energy damage (Reflex half, DC 10 + the chymist's class level + the chymist's Intelligence modifier); she may use her breath weapon once per transformation into her mutagenic form. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16, must know the form of the dragon I extract, and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.
Dual Mind					KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Dual Mind				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The chymist's alter ego gives her a +2 bonus on Will saving throws in her normal and mutagenic forms. If she is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC; if she succeeds, she is free of the effect (as if she had made her original save) and immediately changes to her mutagenic form or back to her normal form. If she has no more uses of the mutate ability remaining for the day, she cannot use dual mind. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 10 to select this ability.
Evasion					KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:This mutagen functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except that it only applies in the chymist's mutagenic form.
Extended Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Extended Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The duration of the master chymist's mutation is doubled.
Feral Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Feral Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens.
Furious Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Furious Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The damage dice for the feral mutagen's bite and claw attacks increase by one die step. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 11 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.
Grand Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Grand Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.
Greater Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Greater Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 12 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.
Growth Mutagen				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Growth Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she increases one size category, as if under the effects of an enlarge person spell. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 16 and must know the enlarge person, giant form I, or polymorph extract to select this ability.
Night Vision				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Night Vision				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The chymist gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision in her mutagenic form.
Nimble					KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Nimble					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The master chymist's lithe physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on all Dexterity checks, Dexterity skill checks, and CMD, and a natural armor bonus to her Armor Class. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level.
Restoring Change				KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Restoring Change			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form or returns to her normal form from her mutagenic form, she heals a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + her character level.
Scent						KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Scent					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The master chymist gains the scent ability in her mutagenic form.
#
Brutality					KEY:Brutality ~ Master Chymist				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 3rd level, a master chymist's taste for violence leads her to strike more powerful blows with weapons easily mastered by her bestial mind. At 3rd level, a chymist in her mutagenic form deals +2 damage when attacking with simple weapons and natural attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 7th level and to +6 at 9th level.

# Master Spy Abilities
Art of Deception				KEY:Art of Deception ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A master spy adds her class level to all Bluff, Disguise, and Sense Motive checks.
Master of Disguise			KEY:Master of Disguise ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A master spy can create a disguise in half the time normally required. In addition, any penalties from assuming a disguise of a different gender, race, age, or size are reduced by 1.
Sneak Attack				KEY:Sneak Attack ~ Master Spy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at every third level (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th). If a master spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.
Glib Lie					KEY:Glib Lie ~ Master Spy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A master spy of 2nd level or higher can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the spy must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the master spy's class level to succeed (as if she were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the spy's lies or force her to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the master spy the glibness spell's bonus on Bluff checks.
Mask Alignment				KEY:Mask Alignment ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A master spy of 2nd level or higher can alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as detect evil). She may choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.
Nonmagical Aura				KEY:Nonmagical Aura ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 3rd level, a master spy can use magic aura twice per day, but only for the purpose of making an object appear nonmagical.
Superficial Knowledge			KEY:Superficial Knowledge ~ Master Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A master spy gives the appearance of knowing more than she actually does. Starting at 3rd level, she can make untrained Knowledge and Profession checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity as if she were trained and gains a bonus equal to half her level on these checks. For example, a master spy masquerading as a noblewoman can make untrained Knowledge (history) checks about the kingdom and Knowledge (nobility) checks about its noble and royal families as if she were trained, but she cannot make untrained Knowledge (nature) skill checks to identify herbs.
Concealed Thoughts			KEY:Concealed Thoughts ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A 4th-level master spy can conceal her schemes from mind-reading magic. When a creature is using detect thoughts or similar magic to read her mind, she decides what surface thoughts her opponent detects, and her true surface thoughts remain private. This ability does not protect against mental attacks or mind-reading that delves deeper than surface thoughts.
Quick Change				KEY:Quick Change ~ Master Spy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:Starting at 4th level, a master spy can assume a disguise in only 2d4 rounds by taking a -10 penalty on her Disguise check. This penalty drops to -5 at 8th level.
Elude Detection				KEY:Elude Detection ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 5th level, a master spy can befuddle divinations used against her as if she were under the effect of a nondetection spell with a caster level equal to her character level. She can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the nondetection for 1d4 rounds.
Slippery Mind				KEY:Slippery Mind ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 5th level, a master spy can slip away from mental control. This functions as the rogue advanced talent of the same name. If the spy has the slippery mind ability from another class, these abilities stack, but she can still only use slippery mind once per round.
Shift Alignment				KEY:Shift Alignment ~ Master Spy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:Starting at 6th level, a master spy's control over her aura improves. When she assumes a false alignment, she can choose to have all spells and magic items affect her as though she were that alignment; this includes helpful and harmful effects. For example, a neutral good master spy can shift her aura to lawful evil so she can pass through a doorway that shocks creatures that aren't lawful evil; if hit by holy smite with this shifted aura, she takes damage as if she were evil. A master spy can change her alignment aura from a masked alignment (as per her 2nd-level class feature, where effects still function based on her actual alignment) to a shifted alignment (as per this ability, where effects function based on her assumed alignment) as a standard action. Shifting her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.
Death Attack				KEY:Death Attack ~ Master Spy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 8th level, a master spy learns the art of killing or paralyzing a foe with a careful strike. This ability functions as the assassin's death attack ability. If the master spy has levels in another class that grants the death attack ability, these levels stack with her master spy level to determine the DC of her death attack, even if she has not yet reached 8th level as a master spy.
Fool Casting				KEY:Fool Casting ~ Master Spy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A master spy of 8th level or higher can trick an opponent into believing that she has been charmed or dominated. When the master spy succeeds at a saving throw against a magical effect that provides ongoing control (such as charm person, dominate person, or a vampire's dominate ability), she can allow the spell to take partial effect. To the caster, it appears that the spy failed her saving throw, but the spy is not under the caster's control. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but the spy is under no obligation to follow the caster's commands. The master spy can dismiss a fooled spell as a standard action. Fooled casting can be used when the spy succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against an ongoing effect, such as that granted by slippery mind.
Hidden Mind					KEY:Hidden Mind ~ Master Spy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 9th level, a master spy gains the benefit of a constant mind blank spell at a caster level equal to her character level. The spy can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the mind blank for 1d4 rounds.
Assumption					KEY:Assumption ~ Master Spy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The ultimate ability of the master spy is to take over another persona entirely, making it her own. As a full-round action, the spy can touch a helpless creature and shift her aura to that of her target. This confuses divination effects and spells, even ones as powerful as discern location, such that they register the spy as being the creature she has touched. This ability is not proof against the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings. The assumption of an identity lasts until the master spy ends it (a standard action) or she uses the ability on another creature.


# Nature Warden Abilities

Companion Bond				KEY:Companion Bond ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								DEFINE:CompanionBondLVL|0																																																																																																																												BENEFIT:At 1st level, a nature warden's class levels stack with levels in all classes that grant an animal companion for the purpose of determining her animal companion's abilities. The nature warden and her animal companion have an empathic link like that between a wizard and his familiar. At 5th level, the nature warden's animal companion gains the same benefits the warden does when in the warden's favored terrain.
# TODO: This is going to be interesting to implement, will likely need code work
Natural Empathy				KEY:Natural Empathy ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:For the purpose of the wild empathy ability, a nature warden's class level stacks with levels in all classes with the wild empathy ability. When in her favored terrain, a nature warden adds her favored terrain bonus to wild empathy checks. She may also choose to use wild empathy to demoralize an animal or magical beast rather than improving its attitude, as if using Intimidate rather than Diplomacy. At 4th level, a nature warden no longer suffers a penalty when using wild empathy to inf luence or demoralize magical beasts. At 7th level, she may use wild empathy to affect vermin (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2). At 10th level, she may use it to affect plant creatures (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2).
Mystic Harmony				KEY:Mystic Harmony ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 2nd level, a nature warden in her favored terrain gains an insight bonus to AC equal to half her favored terrain bonus. She loses this bonus when she is immobilized or helpless.
Wild Stride					KEY:Wild Stride ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 2nd level, a nature warden and her animal companion gain the ability to move through natural hazards of her favored terrain (such as bogs, loose sand, snow, ice, rockslides, and so on) at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment (in effect, this is the woodland stride ability applied to non-plant environmental hazards). Terrain hazards that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.
Animal Speech				KEY:Animal Speech ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 3rd level, a nature warden can speak with animals at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use speak with animals once per day. Her caster level is equal to her class level.
Silverclaw					KEY:Silverclaw ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 4th level, a nature warden's animal companion and any creature she summons with summon nature's ally gain DR/silver equal to the warden's class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
#Favored Terrain				KEY:Favored Terrain ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																							BENEFIT:At 5th level and again at 10th level, a nature warden may choose a favored terrain. This ability is identical to and stacks with the ranger class ability.

Survivalist					KEY:Survivalist ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 5th level, a nature warden suffers no penalty for using an improvised weapon or improvised tool. At 10th level, a warden can spend 1 minute examining and adjusting an improvised weapon or tool; thereafter she treats it as a masterwork weapon or tool.
Woodforging					KEY:Woodforging ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 6th level, a nature warden can manufacture wooden items which she may use with surpassing skill. Once per day, she may use wood shape as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her nature warden level. In her hands, items created with this ability are treated as masterwork items under the effect of an ironwood spell; in the hands of others, they are merely ordinary wooden items of the appropriate type. If the warden uses this ability to create armor or weapons, she may craft them into magic items as if she had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat (though they are merely magical wood in the hands of others, and only ironwood when she uses them).
Companion Walk				KEY:Companion Walk ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 7th level, the nature warden's companion shares the benefits of travel spells (such as tree stride and transport via plants) and polymorph and similar spells (including tree shape) cast by the warden from the druid or ranger spell list. The companion counts either as part of the warden or as an object with no weight, whichever is more favorable for the warden.
Plant Speech				KEY:Plant Speech ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 7th level, a nature warden can cast speak with plants at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use speak with plants once per day as a spell-like ability. Her caster level is equal to her class level.
Ironpaw					KEY:Ironpaw ~ Nature Warden					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 8th level, a nature warden may grant her animal companion and any creature she summons with summon nature's ally DR/cold iron equal to her class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability does not stack with the silverclaw ability. The warden must decide at the time of summoning whether a summoned creature gains the benefits of silverclaw or ironpaw. She may change which ability applies to her animal companion by spending 1 hour in prayer and meditation with the companion within 100 feet.
Guarded Lands				KEY:Guarded Lands ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 9th level, a nature warden may designate an area as her guarded lands, allowing her to treat it as her favored terrain or to enhance her bonuses if it is already in her favored terrain. The area must be no larger than 1 square mile, and the warden must spend 24 hours carefully studying the entire area. This period of study gives her a +2 favored terrain bonus in that area, which stacks with any favored terrain bonus for that area (for example, she also gets her forest favored terrain bonus if her guarded lands are part of a forest). She may also designate one creature type as her favored enemy within those guarded lands, gaining a +2 favored enemy bonus against the creature type that stacks with any favored enemy bonus she has against that type of creature. Allies who can see and hear the warden gain an initiative bonus equal to half the warden's favored terrain bonus for that terrain. A nature warden may have a number of guarded lands equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). When she reaches her maximum number of guarded lands, she can select a new guarded land by abandoning an existing one and performing the ritual for a new area.
Companion Soul				KEY:Companion Soul ~ Nature Warden				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 10th level, a nature warden's bond with her animal companion is so strong that it transcends distance and even death. The companion's devotion ability increases to a +8 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. The warden may scry on her animal companion once per day as if using the scrying spell, except she needs no focus or divine focus. She may view the area around her companion or see through its eyes. If her companion dies, she can revive it with an 8-hour ritual; this has the same effect as raise dead, except it doesn't require a material component and the companion does not gain any negative levels from the ordeal.

The spirit guide also allows the rage prophet to use dancing lights, ghost sound, and mage hand as spell-like abilities once per day each (caster level equal to the rage prophet's class level). The DCs are Charisma-based.
Rage Prophet Mystery			KEY:Rage Prophet Mystery ~ Rage Prophet			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extra																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:At 2nd level and every even level thereafter, a rage prophet learns an additional spell from his spirit guide. These spells are in addition to those listed in Table 2-6: Oracle Spells Known. Like spells from an oracle's mystery, the rage prophet cannot exchange these spells for different spells at higher levels. The rage prophet must be able to cast oracle spells of the listed level to learn one of these spells from his spirit guide. The rage prophet treats the spell as an oracle spell of the listed level. The possible spells are arcane eye (4th), augury (2nd), divination (4th), dream (5th), find the path (6th), helping hand (3rd), see invisibility (2nd), shadow walk (6th), speak with dead (3rd), spectral hand (2nd), spiritual weapon (2nd), unseen servant (1st), vision (7th), and whispering wind (2nd).

As a swift action, the rage prophet can spend 1 round of rage (whether he is raging or not) to give his armor and weapons the ghost touch property for 1 round; this effect ends if the item is no longer in his possession.
Enduring Rage				KEY:Enduring Rage ~ Rage Prophet				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 6th level, as a free action, a rage prophet can extend the duration of his rage by sacrificing a spell slot; this prolongs the duration of his rage for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot used.

# Stalwart Defender Abilities

AC Bonus					KEY:AC Bonus ~ Stalwart Defender				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:A stalwart defender receives a dodge bonus to AC that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.
Defensive Stance				KEY:Defensive Stance ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 1st level, a stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trancelike determination. A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The increase to Constitution grants the stalwart defender 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a result of an enemy's successful use of the Bluff skill or an enchantment spell, his stance ends. The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death. A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the rage spell).
Defensive Powers				KEY:Defensive Powers ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:As a stalwart defender gains levels, he augments his defensive stance. Starting at 2nd level, the stalwart defender gains a defensive power. He gains another defensive power for every two levels of stalwart defender attained after 2nd level. The stalwart defender gains the benefits of defensive powers only while in a defensive stance, and some of these powers require him to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, he cannot select an individual power more than once.
Bulwark					KEY:Bulwark ~ Stalwart Defender				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The defender adds his armor check penalty as a bonus to the DC of opponents attempting to Bluff him and Acrobatics checks to pass by him without provoking an attack of opportunity for moving through spaces he threatens.
Clear Mind					KEY:Clear Mind ~ Stalwart Defender				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The stalwart defender may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The stalwart defender must take the second result, even if it is worse. This power can only be used once per defensive stance.
Fearless Defense				KEY:Fearless Defense ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions. He must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.
Halting Blow				KEY:Halting Blow ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:If a foe's movement in the defender's threatened area provokes an attack of opportunity and the stalwart defender successfully hits the foe with the attack, the foe's movement ends immediately. The foe cannot move again until its next turn but can still take the rest of its action. A stalwart defender must have selected the bulwark power prior to selecting halting blow.
Immobile					KEY:Immobile ~ Stalwart Defender				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender adds his class level to his CMD against any bull rush, overrun, pull, and push combat maneuvers, as well as grapple attempts to move him. The stalwart defender must be at least 4th level to select this power.
Increased Damage Reduction		KEY:Increased Damage Reduction ~ Stalwart Defender	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																		PRECLASS:1,Stalwart Defender=6																																																																																																																																	BENEFIT:The stalwart defender's damage reduction from this class increases by 1/-. This increase is always active while the stalwart defender is in a defensive stance. He can select this power up to two times. Its effects stack. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level before selecting this defensive power.
Intercept					KEY:Intercept ~ Stalwart Defender				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:Once a round as an immediate action, when a melee or ranged weapon would successfully strike an adjacent ally, the stalwart defender can choose to have the weapon strike him instead of the intended target. The attack automatically hits the stalwart defender, regardless his AC or any miss chance in effect, and he suffers the normal consequences of the attack.
Internal Fortitude			KEY:Internal Fortitude ~ Stalwart Defender		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions.
Mighty Resilience				KEY:Mighty Resilience ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The stalwart defender automatically negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from Blinding Critical or bleed from sneak attack). The stalwart defender takes only normal damage from the attack. This power may only be used once per defensive stance. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level to select this power.
Renewed Defense				KEY:Renewed Defense ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:As a standard action, the stalwart defender heals 1d8 points of damage + his Constitution modifier. For every two levels the stalwart defender has attained above 2nd, this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 10th level. This power can be used only once per day and only while in a defensive stance.
Roused Defense				KEY:Roused Defense ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The stalwart defender may enter a defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent in a defensive stance.
Smash						KEY:Smash ~ Stalwart Defender					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a shield bash or a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus -5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the character's Strength modifier. The character can make this attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple; this attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the attack hits, any grapple checks made by the stalwart defender against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.
Unexpected Strike				KEY:Unexpected Strike ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:The stalwart defender can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the stalwart defender, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. This power can only be used once per stance. A stalwart defender must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.
Uncanny Dodge				KEY:Uncanny Dodge ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 3rd level, a stalwart defender gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught f latfooted, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A stalwart defender with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).
Damage Reduction				KEY:Damage Reduction ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 5th level, a stalwart defender gains DR 1/-. At 7th level, this DR increases to 3/-, and at 10th level it increases to 5/-. Damage reduction from different sources does not stack; however, a stalwart defender of 5th or higher level that gains DR from armor (but not from any other source) increases his class-based DR by the value of the armor's DR. Thus a 7th-level stalwart defender wearing adamantine full plate (DR 3/-) has DR 6/-.
Improved Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Improved Uncanny Dodge ~ Stalwart Defender		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 7th level, a stalwart defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the stalwart defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the stalwart defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (see above), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Mobile Defense				KEY:Mobile Defense ~ Stalwart Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:At 9th level, a stalwart defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.
Last Word					KEY:Last Word ~ Stalwart Defender				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:Once per day, while in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender can make one melee attack against an opponent within reach in response to an attack that would reduce him to negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him. For example, a stalwart defender has 1 hit point left when a red dragon bites him; the defender may use this ability even if the dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally). Once the defender's attack is resolved, he suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this ability.
