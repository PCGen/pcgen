Steal Ki					KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~  Steal Ki					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MonkPurityOfBody																																																			DESC:At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki from other creatures, though this ability is controversial in some circles of monks, who see it as nothing less than a form of vampirism. If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of that creature's ki. This ability replenishes 1 spent ki point to the monk's ki pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool. He cannot exceed his ki pool's maximum.

Life Funnel					KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~  Life Funnel				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkWholenessOfBody																																																			DESC:At 7th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal a creature's life force to replenish his own. If the monk has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool and scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he heals a number of hit points equal to his monk level. As with steal ki, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory act, no better than what the undead do to the living.

This ability replaces wholeness of body.																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Life from a Stone				KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~  Life from a Stone			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkDiamondBody																																																			DESC:At 11th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki or life force from any creature, not just living creatures.

SOURCEPAGE:p.111
Mystic Prescience				KEY:Ki Mystic ~  Mystic Prescience					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkDiamondSoul																																																			DESC:At 13th level, a ki mystic gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD.

Shared Defense		KEY:Divine Defender ~ Shared Defense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinMercy																															DESC:At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including paladins) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and CMD and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the divine defender's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25%% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium, or heavy fortification armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.116
Divine Bond			KEY:Divine Defender ~ Divine Bond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinDivineBond																														DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter 7): champion*, ghost touch, heavy fortification, invulnerability, light fortification, moderate fortification, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 of the Core Rulebook). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties: energy resistance for +3 bonus, improved energy resistance for +5 bonus, or righteous* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine defender takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.116

Channel Positive Energy	KEY:Hospitaler ~ Channel Positive Energy		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinChannelPositiveEnergy																												DESC:When a hospitaler reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric equal to her paladin level -3. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using this ability does not expend uses of lay on hands, as it does with other paladins.

Aura of Healing		KEY:Hospitaler ~ Aura of Healing			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinAuraOfJustice																														DESC:At 11th level, a hospitaler can expend one use of her channel positive energy ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing for a number of rounds equal to her paladin level. Allies in this aura (including the hospitaler) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any afflictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the affliction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies can only be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only attempt additional saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed to this aura multiple times.

# TODO: Need Code Support for Domain Slot; Need to allow choice of Domains
Divine Bond			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Divine Bond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																	DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the sacred servant's holy symbol to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/ day of lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the sacred servant takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Call Celestial Ally	KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Call Celestial Ally		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike.PaladinAuraOfResolve																														DESC:At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant. This allows the sacred servant to cast lesser planar ally once per week as a spell-like ability without having to pay the material component cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level, this improves to planar ally and at 16th level, this improves to greater planar ally. The sacred servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level.

She does deal 2 points of damage per level on all smite attacks made against evil undead creatures. You can call out to the powers of good to aid you in your struggle against evil %1 times per day. As a swift action, you choose one target within sight to smite. If this target is an evil undead, you add +%2 to your attack rolls and +%3 to all damage rolls made against the target of your smite. If the target of Smite Evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to +%4. Regardless of the target, Smite Evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite evil is in effect, you gain a +%5 deflection bonus to your AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If you target a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect. The Smite Evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time you rest and regain your uses of this ability.|SmiteEvilTimes|SmiteEvilAttackBonus|SmiteEvilDamageBonus|SmiteEvilDamageBonus*2|SmiteEvilACBonus

# Warrior of the Holy Light
Power of Faith		KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinSpells																															DESC:At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items. At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can call upon the power of her faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of light to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute. At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell lesser restoration. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day. At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as daylight for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated. At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25%% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as light fortification). At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4. The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally, protection against critical hits increases to 50%%.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.118

Evil creatures within this burst take %1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A Reflex save DC %2 halves this damage and negates the blindness. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level + the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. Good creatures within this burst are healed %1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can use this ability %3/day [once per day at 14th level plus one additional time per day at 17th and 20th levels.

Animal Companion					KEY:Beast Master ~ Animal Companion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RangerHuntersBond.AnimalCompanion																																					DESC:A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level - 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices-he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can. The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter's bond.

The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection.

Tricks are usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it can't be retrained. A ranger cannot select an individual trick more than once. This ability replaces the ranger's spells class feature. Skirmishers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items. The following is a list of hunter tricks and their effects.
