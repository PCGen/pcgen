# Modifier Name		Unique Key				Naming Option	Type							Plus		Cost		Visible	Type granted	Source Page		Special Property
Dry Load			KEY:DRYLOAD_PFUC						TYPE:FirearmCartridge						COST:30						SOURCEPAGE:141	SPROP:This special ability can only be applied to alchemical or metalfirearm cartridges. Dry load cartridges can be used to load guns underwater or in other airless environments, such as a vacuum. This ability protects the cartridge's contents as it is being loaded and creates a residual bubble of air that surrounds the firearm, further protecting the ammunition and allowing the firearm with this ammunition to be fired in an airless environment. After the cartridge is loaded, the bubble of air lasts for 3 minutes, or until the firearm is fired, whichever occurs first. A firearm loaded with this ammunition still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls when fired underwater for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When firing a dry load cartridge underwater or in an airless environment, a misfire that results in a firearm explosion occurs normally.


# Firearm Special Abilities:

Lucky				KEY:FIREARM_LUCKY						TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm	PLUS:1								SOURCEPAGE:141	SPROP:A lucky firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see page 9). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 1 grit point, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a lucky firearm has any deeds (see page 10), she can always spend 1 grit point from the lucky firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.
Lucky (Greater)		KEY:FIREARM_LUCKY_GRT					TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm	PLUS:3								SOURCEPAGE:141	SPROP:A greater lucky firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see page 9). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 3 grit points, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a lucky firearm has any deeds (see page 10), she can always spend 1 grit point from the lucky firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.
Reliable			KEY:FIREARM_RELIABLE					TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm	PLUS:1								SOURCEPAGE:141	SPROP:A reliable firearm is enchanted so that it is less likely to jam than other firearms. This enchantment reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 1 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm.
Reliable (Greater)	KEY:FIREARM_RELIABLE_GRT				TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm	PLUS:3								SOURCEPAGE:141	SPROP:A greater reliable firearm is enchanted so as to be less likely to jam than other firearms. It reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 4 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm. A firearm with greater reliable cannot have the reliable special ability.


# Eastern
Blocking			KEY:BLOCKING			NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities					COST:0	VISIBLE:NO	ITYPE:Blocking	SOURCEPAGE:130	SPROP:When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.
Deadly			KEY:DEADLY				NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities					COST:0	VISIBLE:NO	ITYPE:Deadly	SOURCEPAGE:130	SPROP:When this weapon delivers a coup de grace, it gains +4 to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.
Distracting			KEY:DISTRACTING			NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities					COST:0	VISIBLE:NO	ITYPE:Distracting	SOURCEPAGE:130	SPROP:You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon.
Grapple			KEY:GRAPPLE				NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities					COST:0	VISIBLE:NO	ITYPE:Grapple	SOURCEPAGE:130	SPROP:On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. The wielder can then attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple his opponent as a free action.

# Primitive
Fragile			KEY:FRAGILE				NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities					COST:0	VISIBLE:NO	ITYPE:Fragile	SOURCEPAGE:146	SPROP:Fragile weapons and armor cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Armor with the fragile quality falls apart when hit with heavy blows. If an attacker hits a creature wearing fragile armor with an attack roll of a natural 20 and confirms the critical hit (even if the creature is immune to critical hits), the armor gains the broken condition. If already broken, the armor is destroyed instead. Fragile armor is not broken or destroyed by critical threats that are not generated by natural 20s, so if a creature wielding a weapon with a 19-20 or 18-20 critical range scores a critical hit on the wearer of this armor with a roll of less than a natural 20, that critical hit has no chance to break or destroy the armor. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons and armor lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description

# Galdiator
Performance			KEY:PERFORMANCE			NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities					COST:0	VISIBLE:NO	ITYPE:Performance	SOURCEPAGE:144	SPROP:When wielding this weapon, if an attack or combat maneuver made with this weapon prompts a combat performance check, you gain a +2 bonus on that check.
