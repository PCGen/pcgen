Worm that Walks Traits								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Defensive												DESC:A worm that walks has no discernable anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking.  Reducing a worm that walks to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate (see below) - a worm that walks at 0 hit points is staggered, and one at negative hit points is dying.  Worms that walk are immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of such spells and effects generated by the worm that walks itself, which treat the worm that walks as one single creature if it so chooses.  Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures function normally against a worm that walks, since the creature's individual components share a hive mind.  A worm that walks takes half again as much damage (+50%%) from damaging area effects, such as fireball and splash weapons.  Worms that walk are susceptible to high winds - treat a worm that walks as a Fine creature for the purposes of determining wind effects.

While discorporated, the worm that walks loses all of its defensive abilities and gains all of the standard swarm traits.  It loses its slam attacks and all special abilities and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack that deals damage equal to its engulf attack.  A worm that walks can reform into its true form (including equipping all gear in reach) as a full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.

If a creature takes damage from the swarm, it is also subject to the swarm's distraction ability, and must make a Fortitude save (DC %3) or be nauseated for 1 round.  A worm that walks can only have one embraced target at a time, but it does not have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace.  If the worm that walks moves more than 5 feet from the swarm or dismisses the swarm (a free action), the swarm dies.  Any area attack that damages the swarm or any severe or stronger wind effect that affects the swarm's target kills it.|EngulfDamageDice|1.5*STR|EngulfDC																																																					BONUS:VAR|EngulfDamageDice|min(floor((TL+4)/5),5)	BONUS:VAR|EngulfDC|10+TL/2+CON	BONUS:VAR|EngulfDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Squirming Embrace)	SOURCEPAGE:p.287
