You take a -2 penalty to Armor Class, loses your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), and take a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks and on opposed Perception skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and Perception checks based on sight) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) against the blinded character. Blind creatures must make a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check to move faster than half speed. Creatures that fail this check fall prone.
Cowering		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.566							BONUS:COMBAT|AC|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|-max(0,DEX)|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																TEMPDESC:frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class and loses his Dexterity bonus (if any).
Dazzled		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.566							BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT|-1|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																							TEMPDESC:You are unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks.
Deafened		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.566							BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|-4|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																							TEMPDESC:A deafened character cannot hear. He takes a -4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails Perception checks based on sound, takes a -4 penalty on opposed Perception checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.
Entangled		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.567							BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																BONUS:STAT|DEX|-4|PREAPPLY:ANYPC		TEMPDESC:The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.
Exhausted		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.567																											BONUS:MOVEMULT|TYPE.Walk|.5|PREAPPLY:ANYPC											BONUS:STAT|STR,DEX|-6|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	TEMPDESC:An exhausted character moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.
Fatigued		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.567																																													BONUS:STAT|STR,DEX|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	TEMPDESC:A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.
Frightened		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.567	BONUS:CHECKS|ALL|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																						BONUS:SKILL|ALL|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC												TEMPDESC:A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape. Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear.
Grappled		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.567							BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																BONUS:STAT|DEX|-4|PREAPPLY:ANYPC		TEMPDESC:A grappled creature is restrained by a creature, trap, or effect. Grappled creatures cannot move and take a -4 penalty to Dexterity. A grappled creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. In addition, grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform.
Panicked		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.568	BONUS:CHECKS|ALL|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																													BONUS:SKILL|ALL|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC												TEMPDESC:A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can't take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action in combat.
Pinned		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.568							BONUS:COMBAT|AC|-4|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																								TEMPDESC:A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions. A pinned creature cannot move and is flatfooted. A pinned character also takes an additional -4 penalty to his Armor Class. A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check.
Prone			VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.568							BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.MELEE|-4|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																						TEMPDESC:The character is lying on the ground. A prone attacker has a -4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A prone defender gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks. Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.
Shaken		VISIBLE:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.568	BONUS:CHECKS|ALL|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																						BONUS:SKILL|ALL|-2|PREAPPLY:ANYPC												TEMPDESC:A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
