In addition to the options available to all grapplers, a monster with the rake ability gains two additional claw attacks that it can use only against a grappled foe. A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn already grappling to use its rake--it can't begin a grapple and rake in the same turn.

Rock Catching																				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Defensive																																									DESC:You can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.303																									BENEFIT:You can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once per round, if you would normally be hit by a rock, you can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) You must be aware of the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.

A creature can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than its size. A "rock" is any large, bulky, and relatively regularly shaped object made of any material with a hardness of at least 5. The creature can hurl the rock up to five range increments. Damage from a thrown rock is generally twice your base slam damage plus 1-1/2 your Strength bonus.

Scent																						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Sense																																										DESC:You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.304																									BENEFIT:You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. You can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed--only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When you are within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's location. You can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. When tracking by scent you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

All living creatures (except those with the stench special ability) within 30 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC %1) or be sickened for %2 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by your stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.|StenchDC|StenchDuration

If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage.																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.304	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1d%2+%3, AC %4, %5 hp)|SwallowWholeDice|SwallowWholeDamageDie|SwallowWholeBonusDamage|SwallowWholeAC|SwallowWholeHP	BENEFIT:If you begin your turn with an opponent grappled in your mouth, you can attempt a new combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than you. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while you do not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 of your total hit points), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of your interior is normally 10 + 1/2 of your natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in your mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

This works just like the overrun combat maneuver, but the trampling creature does not need to make a check, it merely has to move over opponents in its path. Targets of a trample take %1d%2+%3 points of damage. Targets of a trample can make an attack of opportunity, but at a -4 penalty. If targets forgo an attack of opportunity, they can attempt to avoid the trampling creature and receive a Reflex (DC %4) save to take half damage. You can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.|TrampleDamageDice|TrampleDamageDieSize|TrampleDamageBonus|TrampleDC

BONUS:VAR|WebDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Web)																												SOURCEPAGE:p.305	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(+%1 ranged, DC %2, hp %3)|WebToHit|WebDC|WebHP													BENEFIT:You can use webs to support yourself and up to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, you can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than you. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check (DC %1) or burst the web with a Strength check (DC %1). Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it suffer a -4 penalty. Web spinners can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. A creature can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.|WebDC

Whirlwind																					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.AttackOption										DEFINE:WhirlwindDuration|HD/2	DEFINE:WhirlwindHeight|0	DEFINE:WhirlwindDC|10+(HD/2)+STR																DESC:You can transform yourself into a whirlwind and remain in that form for up to %1 rounds.|WhirlwindDuration																																																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|WhirlwindDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Whirlwind)																										SOURCEPAGE:p.306	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(DC %1)|WhirlwindDC																	BENEFIT:You can transform yourself into a whirlwind and remain in that form for up to %1 rounds. If you have a fly speed, you can continue to fly at that same speed while in whirlwind form, otherwise you gain a fly speed equal to your base land speed (average maneuverability) while in whirlwind form. The whirlwind is always 5 feet wide at its base, A whirlwind's width at its peak is always equal to half of its height. You control the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet and at most %2 feet high. The whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if you enter the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the whirlwind moves into or through a creature's space. In whirlwind form you cannot make your normal attacks, and you do not threaten the area around you. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the whirlwind might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (generally damage equal your slam attack) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %3) when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take damage as if it were hit by the your slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the whirlwind carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The whirlwind can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume. The whirlwind can eject any carried creatures whenever you wish as a free action, depositing them in your space. If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|WhirlwindDuration|WhirlwindHeight|WhirlwindDC

The vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the vortex moves into or through a creature's space. In vortex form the elemental cannot make its normal attacks, and does not threaten the area around it. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the vortex might take damage when caught in the vortex (generally damage equal the elementals slam attack). An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %2) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take damage as if it were hit by the elemental's slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the vortex, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the vortex carries them or to escape the vortex. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the vortex take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The vortex can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume. The vortex can eject any carried creatures whenever you wish as a free action, depositing them in the elementas's space. If the vortex's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the Vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|VortexHeight|VortexDC
