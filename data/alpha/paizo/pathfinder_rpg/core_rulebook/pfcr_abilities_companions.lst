A master may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal).

If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes.

Spell Resistance				KEY:Spell Resistance ~ Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.									SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.
