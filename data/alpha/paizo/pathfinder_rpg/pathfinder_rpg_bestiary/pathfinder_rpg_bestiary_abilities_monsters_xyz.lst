###Block: Xill Abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type								Define					Description																										Source Page		Aspects								Description of the Benefits
Implant			KEY:Implant ~ Xill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary									DESC:As a standard action, a xill can lay 2d6 eggs in a helpless creature.															SOURCEPAGE:p.283										BENEFIT:As a standard action, a xill can lay 2d6 eggs in a helpless creature. A xill's eggs hatch in 24 hours, at which point the young consume the host from within, inflicting 1 point of Con damage per hour per young until the host dies. The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal Plane, if possible, to mature. A remove disease spell (or similar effect) rids a victim of all implanted eggs or active young, or they can be cut out one at a time with DC 20 Heal checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If a check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.
