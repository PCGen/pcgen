Trace Teleport	KEY:Trace Teleport ~ Neothelid	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Sense								DESC:A neothelid telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination, of all creatures that teleport within 60 feet of it.															SOURCEPAGE:p.214																														BENEFIT:A neothelid telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination, of all creatures that teleport within 60 feet of it, gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to "seen casually." This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This power does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.
Swallow Whole	KEY:Swallow Whole ~ Neothelid		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption							DESC:If you begin your turn with an opponent grappled in your mouth, you can attempt a new combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage.									SOURCEPAGE:p.304	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(2d6+10 plus 2d6 acid, AC 23, hp 23)																				BENEFIT:If you begin your turn with an opponent grappled in your mouth, you can attempt a new combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than you. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while you do not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 of your total hit points), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of your interior is normally 10 + 1/2 of your natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in your mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

Heartstone		KEY:Heartstone ~ Night Hag		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SPELLS:Heartstone|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=8|Etherealness|Soul Bind|PREEQUIP:1,Heartstone (Night Hag)	DESC:All night hags carry a heartstone; a special gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt.																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.215	BENEFIT:All night hags carry a heartstone, a special gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt. A heartstone's magic is fueled by the hag's spirit and proximity; once separated from its owner (or upon the hag's death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.
## The heartston needs to be converted to a magic item to go along with this Supernatural ability. The spell-like abilities of etherealness and soul bind as well as the Fort/Ref/Will bonuses need to be moved to the heartstone item.
