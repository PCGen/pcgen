CAPTAIN		SORTKEY:01_Theme	CATEGORY:Theme		TYPE:Theme.Theme Selection	DESC:Most poor fools waste their lives in dull, meaningless routine. They never become captains of their destinies. You, however, made the right choice long ago, literally becoming captain. Your ship means everything - you belong to her and her to you. Whether smuggling goods through a blockade, salvaging derelicts in space, or eluding pirates, nothing happens on board her without your knowledge. You know every corner, every noise, and every imperfection. Other people look upon her and see a rust heap, but to you, this is home.

COMPANION		SORTKEY:01_Theme	CATEGORY:Theme		TYPE:Theme.Theme Selection	DESC:No matter how far technology advances, nothing beats face-to-face communication. Thanks to your training and an innate appreciation for what makes other creatures tick, you understand how people think, what they want, and most importantly, how to give it to them. Your talents and connections make you a valued addition to any crew. With someone like you on board, your shipmates have access to connections, information, and supplies that might otherwise be out of their reach.

DOCTOR		SORTKEY:01_Theme	CATEGORY:Theme		TYPE:Theme.Theme Selection	DESC:Life on the rim of frontier space is dangerous. If someone really wanted to know, you could easily list the eight or nine dozen ways people can die in space - all of them horrible. With you on board, your crew at least has a fighting chance to survive. In another life, you could have earned the big credits working in some fancy hospital and living in an opulent home. Instead, here you are, in the middle of deep  space, pulling bullets out of bodies, treating radiation burns, and otherwise saving their miserable, ungrateful hides. Isn't this the life?

PRODIGY		SORTKEY:01_Theme	CATEGORY:Theme		TYPE:Theme.Theme Selection	DESC:You are different. Not normal. Plenty of people like to inform you of such facts, as if you didn't already know the truth. Whether you were genetically bred as part of a top-secret military program, or grown in a vat to serve in a cabal of assassins, you possess exceptional gifts. Unfortunately, those same gifts leave you confused and vulnerable in social situations. You don't understand people, and you tend to make them uncomfortable. None of that matters, however, once trouble erupts. When everything threatens to fall apart, you truly come alive. No one cares about your socially awkwardness after you've save their lives.

SCROUNGER		SORTKEY:01_Theme	CATEGORY:Theme		TYPE:Theme.Theme Selection	DESC:Other people, people who don't know better, see junk. Not you. You see potential. You see opportunity. You see a spare plasma injector assembly that, with the right modifications, should work with your ship's engines - at least until you can jury-rig something better. While other folk waste time with booze or other pursuits, you're off to the local scrapyard in search of new treasures.
