Special: In some cases, the GM can rule that your outside contacts can't assist. This might be because you're on a world cut off from the Pact Worlds or dealing with a completely alien threat. In these instances, you do not expend a Resolve Point.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Expert Gunnery.MOD				TYPE:Starship Boon															PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Exo-Guardians Tier 2						DESC:Through repeated exposure to the rigors of starship combat, you have learned about how to put a key shot in exactly the right place.

If the result of your skill check is greater than your ally's failed attempt, use your result to determine the outcome. You can use this ability on any skill check so long as it relates to a first contact encounter. A common example would be using skills like Diplomacy or Intimidate on a newly encountered race, but attempting a Computers check to learn from an alien network about a new species would also be appropriate. Exactly when this boon can be used is up to the GM's discretion.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Fusion Guild Contact.MOD			TYPE:Social Boon																PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Exo-Guardians Tier 3						DESC:You've garnered some contacts in Pact World organizations dedicated to the construction of weapon fusions.

Once you have accrued 40 Fame with this boon, your student has come into his or her own and is ready to become a full-fledged Starfinder (a new character). Have your GM mark the Chronicle sheet where you accomplished this, and keep a copy with your new character. When your new character reaches 5th level, instead of choosing four ability scores to increase, you can choose five. Otherwise you follow all other rules for leveling up.
