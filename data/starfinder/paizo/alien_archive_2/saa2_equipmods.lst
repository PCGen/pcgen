#WEAPON FUSIONS
TRITIDAIR		KEY:Weapon (TRITIDAIR)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:You can activate or deactivate the tritidair fusion as a swift action. While the fusion is active, half the weapon's damage becomes electricity damage, and the weapon gains the bright property. When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has an active tritidair fusion, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1d3 rounds.
SYNESTHETIC		KEY:Weapon (SYNESTHETIC)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:When you score a critical hit using a weapon with this fusion, the target must succeed at a Will save or the distinctions between its senses begin to blur in a particularly disorienting fashion. For 1d3 rounds, the affected creature's speeds are halved and it takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, AC, Reflex saves, and skill checks.		SOURCEPAGE:p.45
LEECHING		KEY:Weapon (LEECHING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The leeching weapon fusion gives a weapon the leech critical hit effect. When you score a critical hit with the weapon, if at least one target of the attack takes damage equal to the weapon's item level, you recover a number of Hit Points equal to the weapon's item level, in addition to any other critical hit effect. This healing restores Hit Point damage first, followed by Stamina Points. Any healing in excess of your Hit Point damage and Stamina Point damage is lost. Once you have benefited from this healing, you cannot benefit from the leeching fusion again until you take a 10-minute rest and expend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points.		SOURCEPAGE:p.55
