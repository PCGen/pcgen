Polymorph.MOD		DESC:You change a willing target’s shape into a predetermined polymorphed form of your choice. When you select this spell as a spell known, you design four polymorphed forms for each spell level at which you can cast this spell. These forms should be premade, following the rules for spells with the polymorph descriptor (starting on page 141) and the restrictions for each spell level of this spell, and be as ready to use in play as all other aspects of a character are. Each time you gain a character level, you can change which forms you have available. You choose which of these predetermined polymorph forms the target changes into each time you cast the spell. [1st] Casting polymorph as a 1st-level spell allows you to transform the target into one of the four 1st-level polymorphed forms you know. Your polymorphed forms must comply with the additional restrictions that follow. Unlike most polymorph effects, these forms are close enough to the target’s true form to make the target recognizable, and they cannot duplicate any other specific individual. Each form must be of the animal or humanoid type. You can target only creatures that are Small or Medium with this spell, and all your polymorphed forms must be Small or Medium. [2nd] Casting polymorph as a 2nd-level spell allows you to completely transform the target into one of the four 2ndlevel polymorphed forms you know. Your polymorphed forms must comply with the additional restrictions that follow. Each form must be an animal, fey, humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid. All your polymorphed forms must be Small or Medium. [3rd] Casting polymorph as a 3rd-level spell allows you to completely transform the target into one of the four 3rd-level polymorphed forms you know. Your polymorphed forms must comply with the additional restrictions that follow. Each form must be an aberration, animal, fey, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or vermin. See the vermin benefits in the Type and Subtype section of the polymorph rules. All your polymorphed forms must be Small or Medium. [4th] Casting polymorph as a 4th-level spell allows you to completely transform the target into one of the four 4th-level polymorphed forms you know. Your polymorphed forms must comply with the additional restrictions that follow. Each form must be an aberration, animal, fey, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or vermin. See the vermin benefits in the Type and Subtype section of the polymorph rules. All your polymorphed forms must be Small, Medium, or Large. [5th] Casting polymorph as a 5th-level spell allows you to completely transform the target into one of the four 5th-level polymorphed forms you know. Your polymorphed forms must comply with the additional restrictions that follow. Each form must be an aberration, animal, construct (only if cast as a technomancer spell), elemental, fey, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, plant (only if cast as a mystic spell), or vermin. See the construct, elemental, plant, and vermin benefits in the Type and Subtype section of the polymorph rules. All your polymorphed forms must be Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large. [6th] Casting polymorph as a 6th-level spell allows you to completely transform the target into one of the four 6thlevel polymorphed forms you know. Your polymorphed forms must comply with the additional restrictions that follow. Each form must be an aberration, animal, construct (only if cast as a technomancer spell), elemental, fey, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, plant (only if cast as a mystic spell), undead, or vermin. See the construct, elemental, plant, undead, and vermin benefits in the Type and Subtype section of the polymorph rules.

Baleful Polymorph.MOD		DESC:You change a target’s shape to that of a smaller, weaker creature. [1st] The target shrinks slightly (though it retains its size category) and gains a few cosmetic bestial features of an animal you choose. The target takes a –1 penalty to AC, attack rolls, melee damage rolls, Reflex saving throws, and Strengthand Dexterity-based ability checks and skill checks. Lesser remove condition and similar spells can end this effect. [2nd] As per the 1st-level version, but the target takes a –2 penalty and must attempt an additional saving throw each round until it fails or the spell’s duration ends. If the target fails this second saving throw, its appearance becomes more bestial and the penalty increases to –3. Break enchantment, remove affliction, or remove condition can end the spell’s effect. [3rd] As per the 2nd-level version, but you can make the target one size category smaller (its equipment resizes to remain functional, though it may lose reach with its new size; see Size on page 143). The target must attempt a saving throw every round, with the penalty to AC, attack rolls, melee damage rolls, Reflex saving throws, and Strength- and Dexterity-based ability checks and skill checks worsening by 1 each time the target fails one of these saving throws, to a maximum penalty of –4. If the target succeeds at this saving throw after the penalty has reached its maximum, it is no longer required to attempt saving throws. If the target fails this saving throw after the penalty has reached its maximum, you can change the duration to permanent (D). If an object leaves the creature’s possession for 1 round or more, it reverts to normal. [4th] As per the 3rd-level version, but the penalty begins at –3, and the target must attempt a saving throw every round, with the penalty worsening by 1 each time the target fails one of these saving throws (to a maximum penalty of –5). If the target succeeds at this saving throw after the penalty has reached its maximum, it is no longer required to attempt saving throws. If the target fails this saving throw after the penalty has reached its maximum, you can change the duration to permanent (D). If an object leaves the creature’s possession for 1 round or more, it reverts to normal. [5th] As per the 4th-level version, except if the target fails its saving throw after the penalty has reached –5, instead of making the duration permanent (D), for the remainder of the duration you can turn the target into a Small animal or similar beast that has EAC 10 and KAC 12, can’t make attacks or cast spells or spell-like abilities, and can’t use extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The target retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores in animal form, but it can’t speak or use any abilities of its normal form. Equipment the target is wearing is absorbed into this form, and the target still benefits from any environmental protections on its armor, but the target drops gear it’s holding or carrying but not wearing. [6th] As per the 5th-level version, except if the target fails its saving throw after the penalty has reached –5, you can both make the duration permanent (D) and turn the target into a Small animal or similar beast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
