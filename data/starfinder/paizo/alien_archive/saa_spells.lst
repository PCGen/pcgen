Summon Creature.MOD			DESC:This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an elemental, magical beast native to another plane, or outsider, but also occasionally even extraplanar constructs). The summoned creature appears where you designate and acts immediately on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it to not attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. &nl;When you gain this spell as a spell known, select four creatures from the appropriate list in Table 8 (Alien Archive p.144) for each level at which you can cast this spell. For example, for the 1st-level summon creature spell, you could choose Tiny air, earth, fire, and water elementals. Note that a particular alignment or class is sometimes required to choose certain creatures, as listed in Table 8. In place of a single selection, you can choose a creature from a lower-level summoning list; doing so allows you the option of summoning multiple such creatures at a time. Each time you gain a character level, you can change these selections.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
