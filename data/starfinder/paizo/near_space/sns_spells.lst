Death Affinity							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:necromancy											CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:touch											TARGETAREA:one willing living creature																	DURATION:10 minutes/level										SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No								SOURCEPAGE: pg. 155			DESC:You infuse the target with necromantic energy, physically altering their form into an amalgam of life and undeath. For the duration of the spell, the target becomes immune to the following effects (unless such an effect specifies it works against undead creatures): bleed, death effects, disease, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, negative levels, nonlethal damage, and poison. This immunity does not apply to such effects currently affecting the creature. The creature also gains a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against the following effects: mind-affecting, paralysis, and stunning effects; ability damage; ability drain; and any effect that requires a Fortitude saving throw (unless the effect works on objects or is harmless). For effects that target creatures by type, the target creature counts as both its own type and undead (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). When the spell ends, the above effects end and the target gains the exhausted condition.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Junk Restraints							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)						TARGETAREA:at least 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text												DURATION:1 round/2 levels (D)										SAVEINFO:Reflex negates; see text									SPELLRES:No								SOURCEPAGE: pg. 156			DESC:You turn a pile of technological junk into fetters and shackles that restrain a creature within range. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity. While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with energy powerful enough to restrain a Large or smaller creature. The junk flies toward the creature and attaches itself to the creature's limbs or otherwise ensnares it, causing it to gain the entangled condition for the duration of the spell or until it ends the condition by succeeding at an Acrobatics check to escape as a move action. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × your caster level. If the targeted creature succeeds at a Reflex save, the junk lands adjacent to them harmlessly.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The spell leaves behind 1 bulk of junked electronic equipment in the target creature's space that is suitable for targeting with spells such as battle junkbot, handy junkbot, healing junkbot, junk armor, junk restraints, or junksword. The junked electronics have no resale value and cannot be repaired into any functioning item. A creature trained in Engineering or Physical Science can reveal the useless nature of the junk by directly examining it.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

When an ally within range fails an attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or ability check, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt to shift their reality to one where they succeed instead. That ally can immediately reroll the failed check. A creature can't benefit from this spell again until they take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Personal Gravity							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:personal																																	DURATION:1 hour/level (D)																																	SOURCEPAGE: pg. 156			DESC:You alter gravity's effects on you. You treat gravity as if it were your choice of 1 step higher or lower (for example, if you were in an area of low gravity, you could choose either standard gravity or zero-g). You can suppress or resume this affect as a reaction or swift action. While under the effects of this spell, you can also reduce the distance of any forced movement that would affect you by 5 feet (minimum 0 feet), and you ignore penalties from the off-kilter condition.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Planned Obsolescence						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:close [25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels]						TARGETAREA:one weapon or suit of armor																	DURATION:1 round/level (D)										SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (object)									SPELLRES:yes							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 156			DESC:You transform a weapon or suit of armor into an antique version of itself, giving it the analog and archaic properties. Any technological or hybrid armor upgrades cease to function for the duration of the spell. Entirely magical enhancements, such as weapon fusions, continue to function normally. Weapons that normally deal energy damage deal bludgeoning and piercing damage instead, lose any critical hit effects, and target KAC. Other weapon special properties, such as boost and bright, might also cease to function for the duration of the spell, at the GM's discretion. This spell has no effect on natural weapons and weapons entirely of magical or supernatural origins, such as a solarian's solar weapon.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Polar Vortex							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:evocation		DESCRIPTOR:cold							CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)						TARGETAREA:cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)															DURATION:1 round plus 1 round/level									SAVEINFO:Reflex half											SPELLRES:no 							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 156			DESC:You generate an arctic storm of harsh winds and battering hail and snow. Creatures that enter or start their turn in the area during the first round of the spell take 3d6 cold damage plus 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are affected by freezing, hurricane-strength winds (Core Rulebook 400). For the duration of the spell, creatures flying in the area must succeed at an Acrobatics check to fly in dangerous wind conditions, and terrain within the spell's area is covered with ice and snow, causing it to become difficult terrain.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reanimate Construct						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:touch											TARGETAREA:one destroyed construct creature																DURATION:instantaneous											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No								SOURCEPAGE: pg. 157			DESC:This spell turns a destroyed construct into a creature that obeys your spoken commands. As a standard action, you can instruct a reanimated construct to either follow you or attack any creature (or type of creature) within 100 feet. This spell otherwise functions like animate dead, and constructs you reanimate with this spell count against the total amount of undead you can control with that spell (and vice versa). The reanimated construct is similar to a fully functional version of that creature with the following changes. It has only half of its original Hit Points; any technological gear functions without batteries but technological weapons that require a charge deal only half damage; and it does not regain any uses of consumable items or weapons, such as grenades, or daily-use abilities. The reanimated construct is treated as both magical and technological for all effects (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). The target construct must be mostly intact; creatures that have self-destructed, been disintegrated, been used as the target of a spell with “junk” in its name, and the like are not valid targets for this spell.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Drift Beacons						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:conjuration	DESCRIPTOR:summoning						CASTTIME:1 hour					RANGE:system-wide																																	DURATION:1 day/level											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No								SOURCEPAGE: pg. 157			DESC:You conjure several Drift beacons into your current star system. The beacons appear orbiting the star or stars at various distances but are not in danger of colliding with any other celestial bodies. For the duration of the spell, the system takes 2d6 fewer days to reach for the purposes of Drift travel to that system, to a minimum of 1 day. This reduction is factored in before dividing the result by a Drift engine's rating, and a system can benefit from only one casting of this spell at a time. The beacons return to where they came from when the spell ends. This spell has no effect if cast while not in a star system or while within the Drift, and it does not reduce the time it takes to travel to Absalom Station.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Supercharge Armor							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:abjuration											CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:touch											TARGETAREA:one suit of armor worn by a creature																DURATION:1 round/level											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No								SOURCEPAGE: pg. 157			DESC:You supercharge the target armor. The armor's hardness doubles; the armor sheds light in a 20-foot radius, increasing the light level 1 step to a maximum of normal light; and the creature wearing the armor gains temporary Hit Points equal to 5 + your caster level as long as it wears the armor.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Verdant Growth							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:conjuration										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:close [25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels]						TARGETAREA:one computer system or module																	DURATION:1 hour/level or until triggered, then 1 minute/level, see text			SAVEINFO:Will negates (object), Reflex partial, see text;					SPELLRES:yes (object), see text				SOURCEPAGE: pg. 129			DESC:You turn data into plant matter that either instantly explodes outward or lurks within a device. Instant Growth: You immediately incite growth from the targeted device. A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. For both this and the dormant growth effect (see below), the plant matter explodes from the targeted device, filling all squares within a 20-foot-radius spread. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 slashing damage and is entangled; on a successful save, it takes half damage, isn't entangled, and is shunted to the nearest empty space available. A square of plant matter has hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. The growth also covers the device, preventing non-remote access until the plant matter is destroyed or disintegrates at the end of the spell's duration. Dormant Growth: You implant verdant code into an computer system or module you have root access to. The next time the device is accessed, plant matter explodes from the device (see above). A device can hold only one instance of verdant code at a time, and new instances erase the previous instance. If this spell's duration ends before the implanted code is accessed, the code vanishes. This code can be made permanent, as implant data.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
