You know the general direction and distance of attuned materials, and you can use the interface to surveil its surroundings at distance of up to 50 feet Ã— your mechanic level.

Enshrouding Gloom			KEY:Witchwarper Paradigm Shift ~ Enshrouding Gloom	SORTKEY:Witchwarper / 002a1	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Witchwarper Paradigm Shift.Extraordinary																						PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2			DESC:As a standard action, you can target a creature within 100 feet and plunge it into darkness. This creates an area of magical darkness that affects only the targeted creature and occupies its space. This darkness does not affect the creature's visibility to other creatures, nor its ability to attempt Stealth checks to hide. The darkness overcomes all nonmagical light and is itself overcome by any magical light source. At 8th level, each time the creature takes an action that lets it move while the darkness persists, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or the area of darkness moves with it. Once the creature has failed a saving throw and the darkness has moved with it, the darkness remains stationary for the remaining duration of this effect.	SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Phantom Colossus			KEY:Witchwarper Paradigm Shift ~ Phantom Colossus	SORTKEY:Witchwarper / 002a1	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Witchwarper Paradigm Shift.Extraordinary																						PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8			DESC:As a reaction, when a hostile creature within 100 feet would take any action to move 10 or more feet toward you or an ally, you can force it to witness an alternate reality in which a massive horror covered in tongues, teeth, and armored plates is bearing down toward it. The target creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or it instead loses its action immediately as it is shocked into stillness, and it cannot voluntarily take any additional movement until the beginning of its next turn. Once an attacker has been affected by this paradigm shift, it can't be targeted by it again for 24 hours. This is a fear effect.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.127

Lethal Strike		KEY:Assassin ~ Lethal Strike					CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Archetype Class Feature																																		DESC:As a standard action, you can study the weaknesses of a single enemy that you're observing. Once per day, on a round after you spend 2 consecutive rounds studying the same enemy this way, you can either take a full action to move up to your speed and make a single attack with a melee weapon, or take a full action to attack with a sniper weapon (using the sniper weapon's sniper range if applicable), against the studied enemy. This lethal strike attack deals damage as normal, and the target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your key ability modifier) or take 1d6 additional damage per your character level. If the target fails the save, it must also attempt a second Fortitude saving throw with the same DC. If it fails this second save, it dies instantly; this is a death effect. In addition, whenever you kill a creature using your lethal strike, you can attempt a Stealth check opposed by Perception checks to notice by those in the vicinity; if successful, you prevent those nearby from identifying you as the attacker. If you succeed by 5 or more, bystanders might not even immediately notice that the target is dead (at the GM's discretion).
