##NOTE: Variable-level spells are listed once for each level they may be cast at, denoted by (Level x), as well as once with no level indicator, for use with SLAs or similar effects.
##All versions should appear on output sheets as having the same name. I did this because the power of these spells is maximized at the highest level one has learned the particular spell at.
##If a caster has only learned Flight as a 3rd level spell, they do not gain the ability to cast it as a 4th or higher level spell.
##Comps are Credits (Cr) or Resolve Points (RP)

###Long Spell Descriptions###
Control Atmosphere.MOD																																																																									DESC:You can alter the atmosphere within the spell's area to cause it to become more like the atmosphere of another planet. You can alter one aspect of the atmosphere—its corrosiveness, density, or toxicity. The possible effects of each of these changes are detailed below. Corrosiveness: You can make the atmosphere corrosive. Each creature and object in the area when you cast the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 5d6 acid damage. Creatures and objects that remain in the area take 3d6 additional acid damage every 10 minutes (Fortitude half). Alternatively, you can make a normally corrosive atmosphere noncorrosive. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell's area deals no acid damage for the duration of the spell. Density: You can make the atmosphere in the area one step thinner (going from severely thick to thick, thick to normal, normal to thin, or thin to severely thin) or thicker (going from severely thin to thin, thin to normal, normal to thick, or thick to severely thick). The spell cannot make an atmosphere thicker than severely thick or thinner than severely thin. In addition to the normal long-term effects of being in an atmosphere thinner or thicker than a creature is acclimated to (Starfinder Core Rulebook 396), each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. This is true even for creatures with environmental protection from equipment (such as armor), as the air within the armor is affected on a failed saving throw. Creatures that do not need to breathe are not affected by changes in atmospheric density. If the air is thicker than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, that creature becomes sickened. For every step beyond the first that the air is thicker than the target's acclimation, it takes a –1 penalty to its save against this effect. If the air is thinner than a creature is acclimated to, on a failed saving throw, it is fatigued. For every step beyond the first that the air is thinner than the target's acclimation, it takes a –1 penalty to its saving throw against this effect. The effect ends if the creature moves out of the area, and it is not required to attempt a new saving throw upon reentering the area (instead it is subject only to the normal dangers of thicker or thinner air). Toxicity: You can make the atmosphere toxic. Each creature in the area of the spell when it is cast must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the immediate effects described below. Creatures with environmental protection from equipment already active (such as armor) are not exposed to the toxic atmosphere. A creature that fails its save contracts bubonic plague (no save) and immediately moves to the weakened state. Creatures that enter the area of toxic atmosphere later are exposed to inhaled bubonic plague and follow the normal disease rules for contracting the disease and progressing on the physical disease track. The disease is nonmagical, and those infected are still infected when the spell's duration ends. Alternatively, you can make a normally toxic atmosphere nontoxic. In this case, the atmosphere within the spell's area does not expose those who breathe it to any toxic disease for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Digital Doorway.MOD																																																																									DESC:You gain the ability to step into a piece of electronic equipment currently connected to a communication or information network (such as a comm unit or a computer connected to an infosphere), converting yourself into digital information and traveling along the network. Once uploaded onto a network, you teleport out from any device within 3,000 feet of the device that you entered; if no such device is in range, you emerge from the same device you entered. You are instantly aware of all unsecured devices connected to the same network as the one you entered, and you can attempt a Computers check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the item's level) to detect other devices (this does not require an action); a single check renders you aware of all devices whose DC to detect you exceeded. If the item is a computer, your Computers check result must also exceed the DC required to successfully hack it (Core Rulebook 214). This movement acts as the teleport spell, except there is no chance of missing your destination. When attempting to enter or exit a computer with one or more countermeasures, you automatically trigger any countermeasures that are not successfully disabled. When you emerge from a computer, you can attempt one Computers check, with the result compared to the DC of each countermeasure in place on that computer (this does not require an action); you suffer the effects of all countermeasures with a DC higher than the result of your check. Some countermeasures triggered in this manner are exceptionally dangerous, as noted below. Feedback: The digital virus uploaded into your data causes you to become exposed to the mindfire disease, but the disease has a save DC of 15 + half the item level of the destination device. Firewall: You arrive at the destination prone, and you remain flat-footed and off-target for 1 minute. Wipe: Your recent memories are scrambled, with minor elements removed, causing you to be confused for a number of rounds equal to half the item level of the destination device (minimum 1 round).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Directed Denial Of Strength Attack.MOD																																																																						DESC:You flood targets' minds with a magical effect similar to a computer virus that duplicates every sensation of lifting, carrying, and being burdened. Targets become encumbered, or they become overburdened if already encumbered.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fabricate Scrap.MOD																																																																									DESC:You turn 1 bulk of inert matter, such as debris, dust, rocks, or other unattended 0-level items, into 1 bulk of junked electronic equipment suitable for targeting with spells such as battle junkbot, handy junkbot, healing junkbot, junk armor (see below), or junksword (see below). The junked electronics have no resale value and cannot be repaired into any functioning item. Any direct examination by a character trained in Engineering or Physical Science reveals the useless nature of the junk.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junk Armor.MOD																																																																										DESC:You turn a pile of technological junk into a suit of light armor, or use it to upgrade a suit of light armor to heavy armor. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity. You can cause the armor to be created on yourself or an adjacent willing or unconscious ally. Light or heavy armor you create requires proficiency to use without penalties as normal. If you use this spell to create light armor, the armor has an EAC bonus equal to your caster level, a KAC bonus equal to your caster level + 2, and a maximum Dex bonus equal to 1 + onequarter your caster level. Using junk armor to temporarily turn light armor into heavy armor increases the armor's EAC bonus by 1 and its KAC bonus by 2, reduces its maximum Dexterity bonus by 3, and worsens its armor check penalty by 2.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junksword.MOD																																																																										DESC:You turn a pile of technological junk into a one-handed melee weapon that you can wield against your foes. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity. You are automatically proficient with this melee weapon, and you add 1-1/2 times your caster level to damage rolls with it (in place of a Weapon Specialization bonus). A junksword functions only for its creator, and once created it cannot leave your hand. Should you wish to sheathe it, the junksword obliges by collapsing into a wreath of junk that surrounds your hand like a glove. You can grant your junksword additional abilities based on the spell's level. You can change one modification to your junksword as a move action, or you can completely reconfigure all of its modifications as a full action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junksword (Level 1).MOD																																																																									DESC:Your junksword deals 1d4 bludgeoning and slashing damage and has the analog weapon special property. In addition, you can grant your junksword up to two of the following special properties: block, disarm, nonlethal, reach, or trip.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junksword (Level 2).MOD																																																																									DESC:Your junksword deals 1d8 bludgeoning and slashing damage and has the analog weapon special property. In addition, you can grant your junksword up to three of the special properties from the 1st-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junksword (Level 3).MOD																																																																									DESC:Your junksword has either the analog or powered (capacity 30, usage 2) weapon special property (your choice). It deals 2d4 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it's an analog weapon, or 2d4 electricity damage if it's a powered weapon. In addition, you can grant your junksword up to three of the special properties from the 1st-level list, plus the staggered critical effect. If you select the powered option, your junksword's battery is integrated and cannot be removed, recharged, replaced, or used to power other devices.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junksword (Level 4).MOD																																																																									DESC:This functions as the 3rd-level junksword, but it deals 2d8 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it's an analog weapon or 3d4 damage if it's a powered weapon, and it gains the stunned critical effect (rather than staggered).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junksword (Level 5).MOD																																																																									DESC:This functions as the 3rd-level casting of junksword, but the junksword deals 3d10 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it's an analog weapon or 3d6 electricity damage if it's a powered weapon, and it gains the stunned critical effect (rather than staggered).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junksword (Level 6).MOD																																																																									DESC:This functions as the 3rd-level casting of junksword, but the junksword deals 6d6 bludgeoning and slashing damage if it's an analog weapon or 3d8 electricity damage if it's a powered weapon, and it gains the stunned critical effect (rather than staggered). Additionally, you can grant the junksword one of the following weapon fusions: dispelling, entangling, ghost killer, merciful, or spellthrower.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mental Block.MOD																																																																										DESC:You cause targets of this spell to lose access to their procedural memory, preventing them from using any feat, extraordinary ability, spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that requires an action of any kind. Each round at the end a target's turn, that target can attempt another Will save to end this effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Might Of The Ellicoth.MOD																																																																								DESC:With a touch, you cause a surge of power to flow through the target's slow-twitch muscle fiber (or its equivalent physiology if it has no muscle fibers), increasing the amount of bulk the creature can carry by 3.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Necromantic Revitalization.MOD																																																																							DESC:With a touch, you replenish the negative energies that animate your target, restoring a number of Hit Points. If the target regains all of its Hit Points as a result of this healing, you can apply the remaining healing to yourself, as long as you are an undead creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Necromantic Revitalization (Level 1).MOD																																																																						DESC:Necromantic revitalization restores 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier number of Hit Points to your target you have two options to enhance its effects. |PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Necromantic Revitalization (Level 2).MOD																																																																						DESC:Necromantic revitalization restores 3d8 + your Intelligence modifier number of Hit Points to your target you have two options to enhance its effects. |PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Necromantic Revitalization (Level 3).MOD																																																																						DESC:Necromantic revitalization restores 5d8 + your Intelligence modifier number of Hit Points to your target you have two options to enhance its effects. |PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Necromantic Revitalization (Level 4).MOD																																																																						DESC:Necromantic revitalization restores 7d8 + your Intelligence modifier number of Hit Points to your target you have two options to enhance its effects. The first option is to restore an extra 5d8 Hit Points with a 4th-level necromantic revitalization spell, an extra 7d8 Hit Points with a 5th-level necromantic revitalization spell, or an extra 9d8 Hit Points with a 6th-level necromantic revitalization spell. The second option is to restore a target that was destroyed within the past 2 rounds, bringing it back to its undead state with the number of Hit Points that would otherwise be restored by this spell. This spell can't reanimate creatures that were destroyed by effects that specifically target or have a special effect against the undead (such as wall of fire) or creatures whose bodies were significantly mutilated, disintegrated, or otherwise obliterated. It also cannot restore an undead creature whose existence is tied to an object (such as a necrovite's electroencephalon) if that object has been destroyed. Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Necromantic Revitalization (Level 5).MOD																																																																						DESC:Necromantic revitalization restores 9d8 + your Intelligence modifier number of Hit Points to your target you have two options to enhance its effects. The first option is to restore an extra 5d8 Hit Points with a 4th-level necromantic revitalization spell, an extra 7d8 Hit Points with a 5th-level necromantic revitalization spell, or an extra 9d8 Hit Points with a 6th-level necromantic revitalization spell. The second option is to restore a target that was destroyed within the past 2 rounds, bringing it back to its undead state with the number of Hit Points that would otherwise be restored by this spell. This spell can't reanimate creatures that were destroyed by effects that specifically target or have a special effect against the undead (such as wall of fire) or creatures whose bodies were significantly mutilated, disintegrated, or otherwise obliterated. It also cannot restore an undead creature whose existence is tied to an object (such as a necrovite's electroencephalon) if that object has been destroyed. Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Necromantic Revitalization (Level 6).MOD																																																																						DESC:Necromantic revitalization restores 11d8 + your Intelligence modifier number of Hit Points to your target you have two options to enhance its effects. The first option is to restore an extra 5d8 Hit Points with a 4th-level necromantic revitalization spell, an extra 7d8 Hit Points with a 5th-level necromantic revitalization spell, or an extra 9d8 Hit Points with a 6th-level necromantic revitalization spell. The second option is to restore a target that was destroyed within the past 2 rounds, bringing it back to its undead state with the number of Hit Points that would otherwise be restored by this spell. This spell can't reanimate creatures that were destroyed by effects that specifically target or have a special effect against the undead (such as wall of fire) or creatures whose bodies were significantly mutilated, disintegrated, or otherwise obliterated. It also cannot restore an undead creature whose existence is tied to an object (such as a necrovite's electroencephalon) if that object has been destroyed. Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reanimate.MOD																																																																										DESC:You can reanimate a dead construct or destroyed undead creature that has been dead or destroyed for no longer than 1 day per caster level. If the target had a soul, that soul must be free and willing to return; a target that wants to be reanimated receives no saving throw against this spell, but if the target's soul is not willing to return, the spell fails. Casting this spell requires you to create a complex representation of the target deceased creature worth at least 7,500 credits to serve as a blueprint regarding its reanimation. This object is consumed when you cast the spell. If the target is an undead whose existence is tied to an object (such as a necrovite and its electroencephalon), it cannot be brought back without a new version of that object (with at least the same price as the original). A reanimated creature returns with no Resolve Points, no Stamina Points, and no spell slots (until it rests to recover them normally). It has 5 Hit Points. Any ability scores reduced to 0 are raised to 1 (though any ability score it normally does not have is unchanged). Diseases, poisons, curses, and computer programming or viruses that affected the target at the time of its destruction remain in effect after reanimation. The spell closes wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, but if the body of the creature to be reanimated isn't whole, any missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. This spell can reanimate constructs and undead but cannot raise outsiders or restore life to other creatures. Reanimated undead return to unlife as the same type of undead that they were prior to their destruction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Seeking Shot.MOD																																																																										DESC:You create a spiritual link between a weapon you touch and one target you can perceive with a precise sense at the time of casting. The next attack made with that weapon against that target (as long as it is within 1 minute) ignores cover and concealment. If the attack is a ranged attack, it does not need a line of effect as long as some route exists between the weapon and the target (regardless of how circuitous that route is). The attack is subject to the normal penalties from range increments.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
