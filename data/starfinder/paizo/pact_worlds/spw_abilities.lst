As a move action, you can grant your bonded ally a single combat feat you have for 10 rounds, provided your bonded ally can see or hear you. The bonded ally must fulfill the feat's prerequisites and be able to use the feat. For example, a mechanic's drone can benefit only from feats that a drone can normally gain. If you have already granted your bonded ally a feat using this ability, the previous feat is lost.

If you and your bonded ally both hit the target, total the damage for both attacks before applying the target's DR or energy resistances. In starship combat, when you and your bonded ally both attack the same opponent in the same round with a direct-fire weapon, use the highest of the two attack rolls (each attacker applies her own modifiers to the roll). If you and your bonded ally both hit the target, total the damage for both attacks for the purpose of determining how the target's Damage Threshold affects the damage.

You can't use this ability on the same bonded ally again until you have recovered your Resolve Points after an 8-hour rest or its equivalent, but if you change the target of your combat bond ability before that, you can use this ability on the new bonded ally, provided you have Resolve Points to spend.
