Once per day as a move action, you can gain the benefit of one of these feats for 1 minute. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one of these three selected feats with a different feat that you don't have but meet the prerequisites for.
Advanced Melee Weapon Proficiency	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																														PREMULT:1,[PREWEAPONPROF:1,TYPE.Basic Melee],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Proficiency,Weapon Prof ~ Basic Melee Weapons]																																																																																											DESC:You know how to use advanced melee weapons.																																											ABILITY:Proficiency|AUTOMATIC|Weapon Prof ~ Advanced Melee Weapons																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.154																																														BENEFIT:You gain proficiency in advanced melee weapons (see Weapon Proficiency on page 243).
Agile Casting				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mobility																						PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=4],[PREVARGTEQ:CasterLevel_Highest,4]																																																																			PRESTAT:1,DEX=15							PREVARGTEQ:KeyAbilityScore,15	PREVARGTEQ:KeyAbilityScore,15														DESC:You can move, cast a spell, and move again before foes react.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.155																																														BENEFIT:As a full action, you can move up to your speed and cast a single spell with a casting time of one standard action or less at any point during your movement. If you have a supernatural ability that can be activated as a standard action or less, you can instead use that ability at any point during your movement.&nl;Normal: You can move only before or after casting a spell, not both.
Amplified Glitch				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																																																																							PRESKILL:2,Computers=3,Intimidate=3																																			DEFINE:AmplifiedGlitchNumberOfTargets|0							DESC:You can create sudden distractions with technological devices.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															BONUS:VAR|AmplifiedGlitchNumberOfTargets|CL																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.155																																														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can wirelessly introduce a fast-acting virus into nearby technological devices to briefly cause them to malfunction in loud, surprising ways. You can use this ability on up to %1 target creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. Each target must either be carrying technological devices or be within sight and hearing of such devices. While the locations of such devices are up to the GM, most public spaces (aside from technologically underdeveloped areas) contain enough technology for this feat to function. Your glitch causes alarms to go off, automated devices to spin and flail, readouts to flash brightly, and so on. With a successful Computers check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 x the CR of the highest-CR target), all targets are shaken for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC.&nl;Once you have targeted a creature with this feat, that foe is immune to this ability for 24 hours.|AmplifiedGlitchNumberOfTargets
Antagonize					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																																						PRESKILL:2,Diplomacy=5,Intimidate=5																																																DESC:You know how to make foes extremely angry with you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.155																																														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can antagonize a foe that can see and hear you by attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check (DC = 10 + your opponent's total Sense Motive skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 x the opponent's CR, whichever is higher). If you succeed, the foe is off-target and takes a -2 penalty to all skill checks for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC, or until it makes an attack against you, forces you to attempt a saving throw, or damages you (whichever comes first). Once you have attempted to antagonize a foe, that foe is immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent ability.
Barricade					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																																																																							PRESKILL:1,Engineering=1																																				DEFINE:BarricadeLVL|0										DESC:You are adept at creating quick, temporary cover.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BONUS:VAR|BarricadeLVL|min(1,skillinfo("TOTALRANK",Engineering))																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.155																																														BENEFIT:As a move action, you can stack and reinforce objects that are too small or too fragile to provide cover into a single square of adjacent cover. The GM has discretion over whether enough such objects are nearby to allow you to use this ability, but most urban and wilderness settings not specifically described as empty or barren have enough such material to allow at least one such temporary barricade to be built. The barricade grants partial cover against attacks with line of effect that pass through it. If the barricade is in a square that already granted partial cover, it instead grants normal cover. For more information about cover, see page 253.&nl;The barricade is temporary and not particularly durable. When determining its hardness and Hit Points, treat it as a piece of equipment with an item level equal to %1. Additionally, once it or a creature adjacent to it is hit by an attack, the barricade collapses at the beginning of your turn in 1d4 rounds (unless the barricade is destroyed completely by the attack). There isn't normally enough material for you to build a second barricade in exactly the same space unless you are in a particularly crowded area (as determined by the GM).|BarricadeLVL

You don't need to attempt Acrobatics checks to move at full speed while blinded.

SOURCEPAGE:p.155																																														BENEFIT:As a reaction when an adjacent ally is attacked, you can grant that ally a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC against that attack.

If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional melee attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach.

You can cast the 0-level spells at will and the 1st-level spell once per day for every 3 character levels you have. Your caster level is equal to your character level, and the key ability score for these spells is Wisdom.

Deflect Projectiles			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																																																																																																		PRETOTALAB:8																								DESC:You can use your melee weapon to deflect attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.156																																														BENEFIT:When you would be hit by a ranged attack from a weapon or spell that deals energy or kinetic damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to make an attack roll with a nonarchaic melee weapon that deals the same general category of damage (energy or kinetic) with a +5 bonus. If your attack roll is higher than the attack roll that hit you, you deflect the attack with your weapon, and it misses. This doesn't work against area attacks, even against area attacks that have attack rolls like blast weapons, and you can't use this reaction if you aren't capable of making an attack with an appropriate weapon.
Diehard					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																																																																																											DESC:You are especially hard to kill. Your wounds quickly stabilize when you're grievously wounded.

SOURCEPAGE:p.156																																														BENEFIT:When you attempt a Reflex save against an area attack or area effect, you can fall prone in an adjacent square and roll that Reflex save twice (taking the better result of the two).

SOURCEPAGE:p.156																																														BENEFIT:When you successfully use Bluff to create a distraction, you can allow an ally to attempt a Stealth check to hide (instead of attempting to hide yourself). You can attempt to allow multiple allies to use Stealth to hide, but you take a -5 penalty to your Bluff check for every ally after the first, and on a failed check no ally can attempt to hide.&nl;Normal: Using Bluff to create a distraction allows only you to attempt a Stealth check to hide.

SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																														BENEFIT:Whenever an opponent successfully uses the trip combat maneuver against you, you can attempt to trip an adjacent opponent as a reaction.

You can't use this ability if you are the one to instigate combat or if you are unaware at the start of combat.&nl;When the GM declares that combat has begun, but before initiative is rolled, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt a Bluff check against a single creature that this ability can affect. The DC is equal to 15 + the target's total Perception skill bonus, or 20 + 1-1/2 x the target's CR, whichever is higher.
