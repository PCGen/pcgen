# Default Properties of Weapons
# Modifier Name	Visible	Special Property
Analog		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:This weapon does not use any advanced electronics, computer systems, or electrical power sources. It is immune to abilities that target technology. While this use of the word "analog" is not technically correct when referring to technology, use of the term in this way has become common throughout the Pact Worlds.
Archaic		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:This weapon deals 5 fewer damage unless the target is wearing no armor or archaic armor. Archaic weapons are made of primitive materials such as wood or common steel.
Automatic		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:In addition to making ranged attacks normally, a weapon with this special property can fire in fully automatic mode. No action is required to toggle a weapon between making normal ranged attacks and using automatic mode. When you make a full attack with a weapon in automatic mode, you can attack in a cone with a range of half the weapon's range increment. This uses all the weapon's remaining ammunition. Roll one attack against each target in the cone, starting with those closest to you. Attacks made with a weapon in automatic mode can't score critical hits. Roll damage only once, and apply it to all targets struck. Each attack against an individual creature in the cone uses up the same amount of ammunition or charges as taking two shots, and once you no longer have enough ammunition to attack another target, you stop making attacks. For example, if you were using a tactical X-gen gun with 27 rounds remaining, you would target the nearest 6 creatures in the cone and use up all 27 rounds. If more than one creature is equidistant and you don't have enough cartridges remaining to shoot at all equidistant creatures, determine randomly which one you target. You can't avoid shooting at allies in the cone, nor can you shoot any creature more than once, even if you have enough cartridges to fire more shots than you have targets. Attacks in automatic mode take the same penalties as other full attacks.
Blast			VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:This weapon fires in a cone that extends only to its first range increment. You can't use it to attack creatures beyond that range. For each attack you make with a weapon with the blast special property, roll one attack against each target in the cone, starting with those closest to you. Each attack takes a -2 penalty in addition to other penalties, such as the penalty to all attacks during a full attack. Roll damage only once for all targets. If you roll one or more critical hits, roll the extra critical damage only once (or any other special effects on a critical hit that require you to roll) and apply it to each creature against which you score a critical hit. You can't avoid shooting at allies in the cone, nor can you shoot any creature more than once. Attacks with blast weapons ignore concealment. A blast weapon doesn't benefit from feats or abilities that increase the damage of a single attack (such as the operative's trick attack). Ammunition for blast weapons is designed for blast attacks, so you spend the usage amount only once for each cone of attacks.


Block			VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:Only melee weapons can have the block special property, which represents some kind of guard or crossbar that can protect you from attacks by a foe you strike in melee. When you successfully strike a target with a melee attack using such a weapon, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC for 1 round against melee attacks from that target.
Boost			VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:You can charge up a weapon with this special property as a move action. When you do, you increase the weapon's damage by the listed amount on the next attack you make with the weapon. Boosting expends charges from the weapon equal to its usage value. This increases the weapon's damage and is multiplied on a critical hit. Boosting a weapon more than once before firing it doesn't have any extra effect, and the extra charge dissipates if the weapon is not fired by the end of your next turn.
Bright		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:Attacks with bright weapons illuminate the area within 20 feet of you and your target for 1 round following the attack, increasing the illumination level by one step, to a maximum of normal light.
Disarm		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:When you attempt a disarm combat maneuver while wielding a weapon with the disarm special property, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll.
Entangle		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:A creature hit by an entangle weapon becomes entangled until it escapes with an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 + weapon's item level + the attacker's Dexterity modifier) or a Strength check (DC = 15 + weapon's item level + the attacker's Dexterity modifier). An entangled creature can attempt such a check as a move action. Some weapons (such as stickybomb grenades) have a maximum duration for this effect. See page 275 for information about the entangled condition.
Explode		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:Explosives have the explode special property, which lists the amount of damage the explosion deals, the damage type, special effects (with a duration, if necessary), and the radius of the explosion. When you attack with this type of weapon or ammunition, aim at a grid intersection. Each creature within the blast radius takes the listed damage but can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. If the explode special property has any special effects other than damage, they are negated with a successful saving throw. Some exploding weapons, such as smoke grenades, don't deal damage, so they don't include the damage and damage type entries.
Injection		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:This weapon or its ammunition can be filled with a drug, an injury poison, or a medicinal compound. On a successful attack with the weapon (either the first attack if it's a melee weapon or an attack with the relevant piece of ammunition if it's a ranged weapon), the weapon automatically injects the target with the substance. Refilling the weapon with a new substance acts as reloading it and is a move action. Each different injectable material must be bought separately and can be used in any weapon with the injection special property. See page 231 for rules and prices for drugs, medicinals, and poisons.
Line			VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:This weapon fires a projectile in a straight line that pierces through multiple creatures or obstacles. When attacking with such a weapon, make a single attack roll and compare it to the relevant Armor Class of all creatures and objects in a line extending to the weapon's listed range increment. Roll damage only once. The weapon hits all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll. However, if an attack fails to damage a creature or obstacle hit in the line (typically due to damage reduction or hardness), the path is stopped and the attack doesn't damage creatures farther away. A line weapon can't damage targets beyond its listed range. If you score a critical hit, that effect applies only to the first target hit in the line, and you roll the critical damage separately. If multiple creatures are equally close, you choose which one takes the effects of the critical hit. A line weapon doesn't benefit from feats or abilities that increase the damage of a single attack (such as the operative's trick attack).
Nonlethal		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:This weapon deals nonlethal damage. See page 252 for more information on how nonlethal damage works.
Operative		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:An operative can use the trick attack class feature (see page 93) with a weapon that has this special property. Any character can add her Dexterity modifier rather than her Strength modifier on melee attack rolls with weapons with this special property.	BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT|max(STR,DEX)-STR
Penetrating		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:A penetrating weapon is designed to punch through large objects' outer layers, making it easier to damage them. A penetrating weapon ignores an amount of hardness equal to the weapon's level.
Powered		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:A melee weapon with an internal battery that must be charged to function has the powered special property, which lists its  capacity and usage. Unlike with a ranged weapon, the usage is for 1 minute of operation rather than per attack, though using a powered weapon for less than 1 full minute still expends 1 full usage. The number of charges expended is equal to the usage x the number of minutes the weapon is used, rounded up to the nearest minute. You can activate the power of the weapon as part of the action used to make an attack with it, and it automatically deactivates after 1 minute. As with ranged weapons, you can recharge the battery of a powered melee weapon using a generator or a recharging station, or you can purchase new batteries for it. If you try to attack with a powered weapon that's out of charges, it functions as an improvised weapon (see page 169).
Quick Reload	VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:You can reload this weapon as part of the same action as firing it, instead of taking a move action to reload.
Reach			VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:Only melee weapons can have the reach special property. Wielding a weapon with reach gives you 10 feet of reach for attacks with that weapon. See Reach and Threatened Squares on page 255 for more information.
Sniper		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:Weapons with the sniper special property can be fired accurately at very long ranges if aimed properly. If you aim the weapon as a move action and then fire it on the same turn, use the value listed with the sniper special property as the weapon's range increment. You can still fire a sniper weapon as normal, but it has only the range listed under its normal range entry when you do.
Stun			VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:You can set a weapon with the stun special property to stun mode (or reset it to normal mode) as a move action. While in stun mode, all the weapon's attacks are nonlethal. See page 252 for more about how nonlethal damage works.
Thrown		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:Ranged weapons that must be thrown and melee weapons that can be thrown as a ranged attack have the thrown special property. You apply your Strength modifier to damage rolls for thrown attacks. After you throw a weapon, it lands near your target and you must recover it if you want to attack with it again.
Trip			VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:When you attempt a trip combat maneuver while wielding a weapon with this property, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack roll.
Unwieldy		VISIBLE:NO	SPROP:Weapons with the unwieldy special property are large and awkward, can't be fired without cooling down first, or are otherwise difficult to use with repeated attacks. You can't use an unwieldy weapon as part of a full attack (or any other action in which you could make multiple attacks), you can't attack with it more than once per round, and you can't use it to make an attack of opportunity

# Weapon Fusion
# MODIFY:Price|SET|lookup("Item Level",ItemLevel,"Price")
ANARCHIC		KEY:Weapon (ANARCHIC)											TYPE:Weapon												!PRETYPE:1,EQMOD=Weapon (AXIOMATIC)	SPROP:The anarchic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a chaotic deity. Any attacks with the weapon are chaotic-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/chaotic and ignores the energy resistance of lawful dragons and lawful outsiders. The anarchic fusion can't be added to weapons that have the axiomatic fusion.
ANCHORING		KEY:Weapon (ANCHORING)											TYPE:Weapon
AXIOMATIC		KEY:Weapon (AXIOMATIC)											TYPE:Weapon												!PRETYPE:1,EQMOD=Weapon (ANARCHIC)	SPROP:The axiomatic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a lawful deity. Any attacks with the weapon are lawful-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/lawful and ignores the energy resistance of chaotic dragons and chaotic outsiders. The axiomatic fusion can't be added to weapons that have the anarchic fusion.
BANE			KEY:Weapon (BANE)												TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The bane fusion enhances the power of critical hits against certain foes. Against a designated foe, the bane weapon gains the stunned critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit against an appropriate foe, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the stunned effect. When you add this fusion to a weapon (or create it as a fusion seal), you must select a single creature type (aberration, animal, construct, dragon, fey, humanoid, magical beast, ooze, outsider, plant, undead, or vermin) against which it will apply. If you select humanoid or outsider, you must also select one subtype. The stunned critical hit effect applies only against creatures of the selected type (and subtype, if selected). Once selected, the creature type and subtype can't be changed.
BLASTING		KEY:Weapon (BLASTING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The blasting fusion allows a weapon to make a single attack as a blast (see the blast weapon special property on page 180) once per day as a full action. This attack has a maximum range of 30 feet and deals half the weapon's normal damage. Only ranged weapons that don't have the automatic, explode, line, or thrown weapon special property can benefit from the blasting fusion. Weapons that don't require attack rolls to affect their targets also can't benefit from the blasting fusion
BLEEDING		KEY:Weapon (BLEEDING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The bleeding fusion weaves entropic energy into the weapon's form. The weapon gains the bleed critical hit effect (see page 182). The amount of damage taken each round from this effect is equal to 1d6 per 5 levels of the weapon, rounded down. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the bleed effect. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can have this fusion.
BURST			KEY:Weapon (BURST)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:With the burst fusion, a weapon's energy damage can form a small explosion that spills onto a second target. The weapon gains the arc critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the arc effect. The amount of damage dealt to the secondary target is equal to one-third the level of the weapon with the burst fusion (minimum 1). Only weapons that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage can benefit from a burst fusion. If your weapon deals more than one type of energy damage, you select one of those types for the arc critical hit effect to apply to secondary targets when the fusion is added.
CALLED		KEY:Weapon (CALLED)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the called fusion can be teleported to its owner's hand as a swift action, even if the weapon is in the possession of another creature. This ability has a maximum range of 100 feet, and effects that block teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon. A weapon with the called fusion must be in your possession for at least 24 hours for this ability to function.
CORROSIVE		KEY:Weapon (CORROSIVE)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The corrosive fusion weaves the destructive power of acid into the weapon's form. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with acid damage. You can activate or deactivate the corrosive fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with acid (you decide which damage type is replaced each time you activate the corrosive fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal acid damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.
DEAFENING		KEY:Weapon (DEAFENING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:With the deafening fusion, a weapon releases a blast of lowfrequency sonic energy on impact. The weapon gains the deafen critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the deafen effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic damage can benefit from a deafening fusion.
DEFIANT		KEY:Weapon (DEFIANT)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the defiant fusion resists efforts to be removed from its wielder. If you are wielding it when you are knocked unconscious, panicked, or stunned, it stays in your hand. You also gain a bonus to your KAC against combat maneuvers to disarm the weapon equal to one-fifth the weapon's level (minimum +1).
DEVASTATING		KEY:Weapon (DEVASTATING)										TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:You can apply the devastating fusion only to a weapon with two or more critical hit effects. When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has the devastating fusion, you can select two of the critical hit effects to apply to the target (even if you are normally required to select just one critical hit effect).
DISPELLING		KEY:Weapon (DISPELLING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the dispelling fusion gathers spare wisps of latent magic during combat, which it can then unleash in a focused effort to dispel magic. The weapon gains dispelling as a critical hit effect in combat. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, so you must be in combat and facing a significant enemy (see page 242) for it to gain this critical hit effect. If there's any doubt about whether you're in combat or able to access the critical hit effect, the GM decides. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the dispelling effect. A target affected by the dispelling critical hit effect is the subject of a targeted dispel magic, as the spell, using the weapon's item level as the dispel check's caster level.
DISRUPTIVE		KEY:Weapon (DISRUPTIVE)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The disruptive fusion imbues a weapon with powerful positive energy designed to disrupt the magical forces that allow undead to exist. The weapon ignores any DR and energy resistance of undead creatures. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning damage can benefit from this fusion.
DURABLE		KEY:Weapon (DURABLE)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The durable fusion uses magical runes and reinforcements to significantly increase a weapon's toughness. When determining a weapon's hardness, Hit Points, and saving throws, treat its item level as being 5 higher. For more about calculating these values, see Breaking Objects on page 409.
ENTANGLING		KEY:Weapon (ENTANGLING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the entangling fusion gains the entangle weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an entangle attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is affected by the entangle condition. The entangle effect ends after 1d4 rounds if the target has not already escaped it. Only weapons that do bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or cold damage can benefit from this fusion.
FLAMING		KEY:Weapon (FLAMING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The flaming fusion imbues a weapon with the fiery power of a star. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with fire damage. You can activate or deactivate the flaming fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with fire (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the flaming fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal fire damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.
FROST			KEY:Weapon (FROST)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The frost fusion imbues a weapon with the icy cold of a dead world far from its system's sun. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with cold damage. You can activate or deactivate the frost fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with cold (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the frost fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal cold damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.
GHOST KILLER	KEY:Weapon (GHOST KILLER)										TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:Attacks from a weapon with this fusion deal full damage to incorporeal creatures. They also pass into the Ethereal Plane, allowing such attacks to affect ethereal creatures normally. Weapons with the ghost killer fusion can also score critical hits against incorporeal creatures. In addition, an incorporeal creature (though not an ethereal one) can pick up, move, or wield a ghost killer weapon.
GLAMERED		KEY:Weapon (GLAMERED)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:As a standard action, a weapon with the glamered fusion can be commanded to change its appearance to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its properties (including bulk) when disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a glamered weapon while it is in disguise. After a glamered weapon is used to make an attack, this fusion is suppressed for 1 minute.
HOLY			KEY:Weapon (HOLY)												TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the holy fusion becomes blessed with divine energy from a good deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are good-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/good and ignores the energy resistance of evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead. The holy fusion cannot be added to weapons that have the unholy fusion.
HYBRIDIZED		KEY:Weapon (HYBRIDIZED)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the hybridized fusion replaces much of its technological functions with magic counterparts. It gains the analog weapon special property (see page 180), and the core function of the weapon is considered to be a hybrid of magic and technology (rather than only the fusion counting as a hybrid item). A hybridized weapon still consumes ammunition and battery charges normally.
ILLUMINATING	KEY:Weapon (ILLUMINATING)										TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The illuminating fusion causes a weapon to gain the bright weapon special property (see page 181). You can deactivate this fusion as a move action, in which case the weapon acts as if it does not have the bright property until it is reactivated (which also requires a move action).
KNOCKDOWN		KEY:Weapon (KNOCKDOWN)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:With the knockdown fusion, a weapon disrupts a target's center of gravity. The weapon gains the knockdown critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the knockdown effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning damage can benefit from this fusion.
MERCIFUL		KEY:Weapon (MERCIFUL)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the merciful fusion often hums pleasantly when at rest and makes soft, airy musical noises when it is used to make an attack. The magic of this fusion subdues the damaging effect of the weapon it is added to. While this fusion is active, the weapon's regular damage becomes nonlethal damage. If the weapon deals two types of damage, both of the damage types become nonlethal. You can activate or deactivate the merciful fusion as a swift action.
OMINOUS		KEY:Weapon (OMINOUS)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the ominous fusion trails a shadowy haze behind it and moans a menacing dirge in battle. The weapon gains intimidation as a critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the intimidation effect. A target affected by the intimidation critical hit effect is shaken for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates). A creature that gains the shaken condition from a weapon with the ominous fusion can't gain that condition again from the same weapon for 24 hours.
RETURNING		KEY:Weapon (RETURNING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:You can add this fusion only to a weapon that has the thrown weapon special property. A returning weapon flies through the air back to you after you make a thrown ranged attack with it. It returns to you just before your next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn). Catching the weapon when it comes back takes no action. If you can't catch it, or if you have moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which you threw it.
SEEKING		KEY:Weapon (SEEKING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The seeking fusion causes an attack from a weapon to veer toward its target. This negates any miss chance caused by the target having concealment, though it has no effect on miss chances from other sources (and does not offset the miss chance from a target having total concealment).
SHOCK			KEY:Weapon (SHOCK)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The shock fusion weaves the electrical energy of the universe into the weapon's form. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with electricity damage. You can activate or deactivate the shock fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with electricity (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the shock fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal electricity damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.
SPELLTHROWER	KEY:Weapon (SPELLTHROWER)										TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the spellthrower fusion is able to have a single spell gem loaded into it at a time. It takes 1 minute to load a spell gem, and only gems containing a spell with a casting time of one standard action or less and a spell level no greater than one-quarter the weapon's item level can be loaded into the weapon. If you are proficient with and wielding the weapon, as a full action you can cast the spell contained within the spell gem rather than make a normal attack. This allows you to use the spell gem as if you were a spellcaster with the spell on your class's spell list. Unlike the normal rules for using a spell gem, it does not matter if the gem's item level is higher than your caster level (even if your caster level is 0). However, if the spell gem's item level is higher than your base attack bonus, once you've spent the full action to cast the spell, you must succeed at an attack roll with the weapon against an AC equal to the spell gem's level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. This roll represents your expertise with the weapon, and no actual attack or ammunition is used. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell is expended harmlessly and the spell gem is destroyed.
THUNDERING		KEY:Weapon (THUNDERING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The thundering fusion imbues a weapon with heightened frequency vibrations. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with sonic damage. You can activate or deactivate the thundering fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with sonic (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the thundering fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal sonic damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.
TRAILBLAZER		KEY:Weapon (TRAILBLAZER)										TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the trailblazer fusion manages to alter the nature of its attacks to overcome the penalties of some natural environmental effects. Its attacks ignore the cover provided by bogs and the cover creatures submerged at least chest deep in water receive from attacks made from the surface. Fire damage dealt by the weapon to underwater targets does half normal damage (rather than the normal one-quarter), and other attacks made underwater deal full damage (rather than the normal half damage). Additionally, ranged attack rolls with the weapon don't take a penalty due to the effects of storms, strong and severe winds, or windstorms. It can even be used to make ranged attacks in severe storms as if they were typical storms and in hurricaneforce winds as if they were strong winds. See Biomes on page 396 for more information on environments that impose attack penalties, and see Underwater Combat on page 405 for rules on attacking submerged targets.
UNHOLY		KEY:Weapon (UNHOLY)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The unholy fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from an evil deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are evil-aligned. Damage from the weapon overcomes DR/evil and ignores the energy resistance of good dragons and good outsiders. The unholy fusion can't be added to weapons that have the holy fusion.
VENOMOUS		KEY:Weapon (VENOMOUS)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:A weapon with the venomous fusion gains the injection weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an injection attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is exposed to the drug, medicinal, or poison when you use the injection property in an attack. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.
VORPAL		KEY:Weapon (VORPAL)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:With the vorpal fusion, a weapon can tear between the molecules of a creature. The weapon gains the severe wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the severe wound effect. Only a weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.
WOUNDING		KEY:Weapon (WOUNDING)											TYPE:Weapon																		SPROP:The wounding fusion causes a weapon to deal exceptionally traumatic damage. The weapon gains the wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the wound effect.

#	ANARCHIC		KEY:Weapon (ANARCHIC)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	!PRETYPE:1,EQMOD=Weapon (AXIOMATIC)		SPROP:The anarchic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a chaotic deity. Any attacks with the weapon are chaotic-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/chaotic and ignores the energy resistance of lawful dragons and lawful outsiders. The anarchic fusion can't be added to weapons that have the axiomatic fusion.
#	ANCHORING		KEY:Weapon (ANCHORING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon
#	AXIOMATIC		KEY:Weapon (AXIOMATIC)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	!PRETYPE:1,EQMOD=Weapon (ANARCHIC)	SPROP:The axiomatic fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from a lawful deity. Any attacks with the weapon are lawful-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/lawful and ignores the energy resistance of chaotic dragons and chaotic outsiders. The axiomatic fusion can't be added to weapons that have the anarchic fusion.
#	BANE			KEY:Weapon (BANE)			PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,5	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The bane fusion enhances the power of critical hits against certain foes. Against a designated foe, the bane weapon gains the stunned critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit against an appropriate foe, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the stunned effect. When you add this fusion to a weapon (or create it as a fusion seal), you must select a single creature type (aberration, animal, construct, dragon, fey, humanoid, magical beast, ooze, outsider, plant, undead, or vermin) against which it will apply. If you select humanoid or outsider, you must also select one subtype. The stunned critical hit effect applies only against creatures of the selected type (and subtype, if selected). Once selected, the creature type and subtype can't be changed.
#	BLASTING		KEY:Weapon (BLASTING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The blasting fusion allows a weapon to make a single attack as a blast (see the blast weapon special property on page 180) once per day as a full action. This attack has a maximum range of 30 feet and deals half the weapon's normal damage. Only ranged weapons that don't have the automatic, explode, line, or thrown weapon special property can benefit from the blasting fusion. Weapons that don't require attack rolls to affect their targets also can't benefit from the blasting fusion
#	BLEEDING		KEY:Weapon (BLEEDING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,5	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The bleeding fusion weaves entropic energy into the weapon's form. The weapon gains the bleed critical hit effect (see page 182). The amount of damage taken each round from this effect is equal to 1d6 per 5 levels of the weapon, rounded down. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the bleed effect. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can have this fusion.
#	BURST			KEY:Weapon (BURST)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:With the burst fusion, a weapon's energy damage can form a small explosion that spills onto a second target. The weapon gains the arc critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the arc effect. The amount of damage dealt to the secondary target is equal to one-third the level of the weapon with the burst fusion (minimum 1). Only weapons that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage can benefit from a burst fusion. If your weapon deals more than one type of energy damage, you select one of those types for the arc critical hit effect to apply to secondary targets when the fusion is added.
#	CALLED		KEY:Weapon (CALLED)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the called fusion can be teleported to its owner's hand as a swift action, even if the weapon is in the possession of another creature. This ability has a maximum range of 100 feet, and effects that block teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon. A weapon with the called fusion must be in your possession for at least 24 hours for this ability to function.
#	CORROSIVE		KEY:Weapon (CORROSIVE)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,9	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The corrosive fusion weaves the destructive power of acid into the weapon's form. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with acid damage. You can activate or deactivate the corrosive fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with acid (you decide which damage type is replaced each time you activate the corrosive fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal acid damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.
#	DEAFENING		KEY:Weapon (DEAFENING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,3	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:With the deafening fusion, a weapon releases a blast of lowfrequency sonic energy on impact. The weapon gains the deafen critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the deafen effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic damage can benefit from a deafening fusion.
#	DEFIANT		KEY:Weapon (DEFIANT)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the defiant fusion resists efforts to be removed from its wielder. If you are wielding it when you are knocked unconscious, panicked, or stunned, it stays in your hand. You also gain a bonus to your KAC against combat maneuvers to disarm the weapon equal to one-fifth the weapon's level (minimum +1).
#	DEVASTATING		KEY:Weapon (DEVASTATING)	PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,5	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:You can apply the devastating fusion only to a weapon with two or more critical hit effects. When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has the devastating fusion, you can select two of the critical hit effects to apply to the target (even if you are normally required to select just one critical hit effect).
#	DISPELLING		KEY:Weapon (DISPELLING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,3	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the dispelling fusion gathers spare wisps of latent magic during combat, which it can then unleash in a focused effort to dispel magic. The weapon gains dispelling as a critical hit effect in combat. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, so you must be in combat and facing a significant enemy (see page 242) for it to gain this critical hit effect. If there's any doubt about whether you're in combat or able to access the critical hit effect, the GM decides. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the dispelling effect. A target affected by the dispelling critical hit effect is the subject of a targeted dispel magic, as the spell, using the weapon's item level as the dispel check's caster level.
#	DISRUPTIVE		KEY:Weapon (DISRUPTIVE)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,3	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The disruptive fusion imbues a weapon with powerful positive energy designed to disrupt the magical forces that allow undead to exist. The weapon ignores any DR and energy resistance of undead creatures. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning damage can benefit from this fusion.
#	DURABLE		KEY:Weapon (DURABLE)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The durable fusion uses magical runes and reinforcements to significantly increase a weapon's toughness. When determining a weapon's hardness, Hit Points, and saving throws, treat its item level as being 5 higher. For more about calculating these values, see Breaking Objects on page 409.
#	ENTANGLING		KEY:Weapon (ENTANGLING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the entangling fusion gains the entangle weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an entangle attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is affected by the entangle condition. The entangle effect ends after 1d4 rounds if the target has not already escaped it. Only weapons that do bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or cold damage can benefit from this fusion.
#	FLAMING		KEY:Weapon (FLAMING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,5	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The flaming fusion imbues a weapon with the fiery power of a star. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with fire damage. You can activate or deactivate the flaming fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with fire (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the flaming fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal fire damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.
#	FROST			KEY:Weapon (FROST)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,5	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The frost fusion imbues a weapon with the icy cold of a dead world far from its system's sun. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with cold damage. You can activate or deactivate the frost fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with cold (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the frost fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal cold damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.
#	GHOST KILLER	KEY:Weapon (GHOST KILLER)	PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,5	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:Attacks from a weapon with this fusion deal full damage to incorporeal creatures. They also pass into the Ethereal Plane, allowing such attacks to affect ethereal creatures normally. Weapons with the ghost killer fusion can also score critical hits against incorporeal creatures. In addition, an incorporeal creature (though not an ethereal one) can pick up, move, or wield a ghost killer weapon.
#	GLAMERED		KEY:Weapon (GLAMERED)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:As a standard action, a weapon with the glamered fusion can be commanded to change its appearance to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its properties (including bulk) when disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a glamered weapon while it is in disguise. After a glamered weapon is used to make an attack, this fusion is suppressed for 1 minute.
#	HOLY			KEY:Weapon (HOLY)			PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the holy fusion becomes blessed with divine energy from a good deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are good-aligned. Damage from the weapon bypasses DR/good and ignores the energy resistance of evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead. The holy fusion cannot be added to weapons that have the unholy fusion.
#	HYBRIDIZED		KEY:Weapon (HYBRIDIZED)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the hybridized fusion replaces much of its technological functions with magic counterparts. It gains the analog weapon special property (see page 180), and the core function of the weapon is considered to be a hybrid of magic and technology (rather than only the fusion counting as a hybrid item). A hybridized weapon still consumes ammunition and battery charges normally.
#	ILLUMINATING	KEY:Weapon (ILLUMINATING)	PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The illuminating fusion causes a weapon to gain the bright weapon special property (see page 181). You can deactivate this fusion as a move action, in which case the weapon acts as if it does not have the bright property until it is reactivated (which also requires a move action).
#	KNOCKDOWN		KEY:Weapon (KNOCKDOWN)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,6	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:With the knockdown fusion, a weapon disrupts a target's center of gravity. The weapon gains the knockdown critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the knockdown effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning damage can benefit from this fusion.
#	MERCIFUL		KEY:Weapon (MERCIFUL)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the merciful fusion often hums pleasantly when at rest and makes soft, airy musical noises when it is used to make an attack. The magic of this fusion subdues the damaging effect of the weapon it is added to. While this fusion is active, the weapon's regular damage becomes nonlethal damage. If the weapon deals two types of damage, both of the damage types become nonlethal. You can activate or deactivate the merciful fusion as a swift action.
#	OMINOUS		KEY:Weapon (OMINOUS)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the ominous fusion trails a shadowy haze behind it and moans a menacing dirge in battle. The weapon gains intimidation as a critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the intimidation effect. A target affected by the intimidation critical hit effect is shaken for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates). A creature that gains the shaken condition from a weapon with the ominous fusion can't gain that condition again from the same weapon for 24 hours.
#	RETURNING		KEY:Weapon (RETURNING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:You can add this fusion only to a weapon that has the thrown weapon special property. A returning weapon flies through the air back to you after you make a thrown ranged attack with it. It returns to you just before your next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn). Catching the weapon when it comes back takes no action. If you can't catch it, or if you have moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which you threw it.
#	SEEKING		KEY:Weapon (SEEKING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,3	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The seeking fusion causes an attack from a weapon to veer toward its target. This negates any miss chance caused by the target having concealment, though it has no effect on miss chances from other sources (and does not offset the miss chance from a target having total concealment).
#	SHOCK			KEY:Weapon (SHOCK)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,5	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The shock fusion weaves the electrical energy of the universe into the weapon's form. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with electricity damage. You can activate or deactivate the shock fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with electricity (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the shock fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal electricity damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.
#	SPELLTHROWER	KEY:Weapon (SPELLTHROWER)	PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the spellthrower fusion is able to have a single spell gem loaded into it at a time. It takes 1 minute to load a spell gem, and only gems containing a spell with a casting time of one standard action or less and a spell level no greater than one-quarter the weapon's item level can be loaded into the weapon. If you are proficient with and wielding the weapon, as a full action you can cast the spell contained within the spell gem rather than make a normal attack. This allows you to use the spell gem as if you were a spellcaster with the spell on your class's spell list. Unlike the normal rules for using a spell gem, it does not matter if the gem's item level is higher than your caster level (even if your caster level is 0). However, if the spell gem's item level is higher than your base attack bonus, once you've spent the full action to cast the spell, you must succeed at an attack roll with the weapon against an AC equal to the spell gem's level + 1 or you fail to cast the spell. This roll represents your expertise with the weapon, and no actual attack or ammunition is used. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell is expended harmlessly and the spell gem is destroyed.
#	THUNDERING		KEY:Weapon (THUNDERING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,9	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The thundering fusion imbues a weapon with heightened frequency vibrations. Half the weapon's damage type is replaced with sonic damage. You can activate or deactivate the thundering fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with sonic (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the thundering fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal sonic damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.
#	TRAILBLAZER		KEY:Weapon (TRAILBLAZER)	PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,1	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the trailblazer fusion manages to alter the nature of its attacks to overcome the penalties of some natural environmental effects. Its attacks ignore the cover provided by bogs and the cover creatures submerged at least chest deep in water receive from attacks made from the surface. Fire damage dealt by the weapon to underwater targets does half normal damage (rather than the normal one-quarter), and other attacks made underwater deal full damage (rather than the normal half damage). Additionally, ranged attack rolls with the weapon don't take a penalty due to the effects of storms, strong and severe winds, or windstorms. It can even be used to make ranged attacks in severe storms as if they were typical storms and in hurricaneforce winds as if they were strong winds. See Biomes on page 396 for more information on environments that impose attack penalties, and see Underwater Combat on page 405 for rules on attacking submerged targets.
#	UNHOLY		KEY:Weapon (UNHOLY)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The unholy fusion imbues a weapon with divine energy from an evil deity. Any attacks with the fused weapon are evil-aligned. Damage from the weapon overcomes DR/evil and ignores the energy resistance of good dragons and good outsiders. The unholy fusion can't be added to weapons that have the holy fusion.
#	VENOMOUS		KEY:Weapon (VENOMOUS)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,2	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:A weapon with the venomous fusion gains the injection weapon special property (see page 181). Only a single attack each day may benefit from this property, and you must announce before making an attack that it is an injection attack. Regardless of how many targets you can hit with a single attack from your weapon, only a single target of your choice is exposed to the drug, medicinal, or poison when you use the injection property in an attack. Only weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.
#	VORPAL		KEY:Weapon (VORPAL)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,10	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:With the vorpal fusion, a weapon can tear between the molecules of a creature. The weapon gains the severe wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the severe wound effect. Only a weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.
#	WOUNDING		KEY:Weapon (WOUNDING)		PREEQVARGTEQ:ItemLevel,7	MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	PREEQVARLT:UpgradeSlotTaken,UpgradeSlot			TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The wounding fusion causes a weapon to deal exceptionally traumatic damage. The weapon gains the wound critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the wound effect.

Quick-release sheath		KEY:Armor (Quick-release sheath)		TYPE:Armor	COST:325												BONUS:VAR|LightBulk|1							SPROP:ItemLevel=1	SPROP:Bulk=L		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:This articulated compartment can hold a one-handed weapon of no more than light bulk. You can activate this upgrade as a swift action to put the item in your hand as though you'd drawn it.
Radiation buffer			KEY:Armor (Radiation buffer)			TYPE:Armor	COST:200												BONUS:VAR|LightBulk|1							SPROP:ItemLevel=1	SPROP:Bulk=L		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:This device grants a +2 bonus to your initial saving throw against radiation (see page 403) in addition to any bonuses from your armor's environmental protection. This doesn't provide any bonus to saves against the secondary effects of radiation.
Tensile reinforcement		KEY:Armor (Tensile reinforcement)		TYPE:Armor	COST:150																						SPROP:ItemLevel=1	SPROP:BULK=-		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:When calculating your armor's hardness and Hit Points (see page 409), treat it as if its item level were 5 higher.
Automated loader			KEY:Armor (Automated loader)			TYPE:Armor	COST:750		PRETYPE:1,Powered_Armor							BONUS:VAR|Bulk|1								SPROP:ItemLevel=2	SPROP:Bulk=1		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:This device attaches to powered armor and consists of a small robotic arm and a storage compartment that holds up to 2 bulk of ammunition and batteries. You can activate the automated loader as a move action to reload or recharge a weapon that's mounted to the powered armor (but not to replace the batteries of the powered armor itself). Abilities that let you reload faster than a move action don't apply to an automated loader. This upgrade can be installed only in powered armor.
Jump jets				KEY:Armor (Jump jets)				TYPE:Armor	COST:1000		PRETYPE:1,Light_Armor,Heavy_Armor					BONUS:VAR|LightBulk|1	BONUS:VAR|Fly_Set|30|TYPE=Base	SPROP:ItemLevel=2	SPROP:Bulk=L		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:[CAPACITY: 20; USAGE: 2/action] You can activate jump jets as part of a move action in order to fly during your movement. You can fly up to 30 feet (average maneuverability) with a maximum height of 10 feet, or you can fly up to 20 feet straight up. You must land at the end of your move action. Jump jets can't lift you if you're encumbered. This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.
Force field, brown		KEY:Armor (Force field (brown))		TYPE:Armor	COST:1600												BONUS:VAR|LightBulk|1							SPROP:ItemLevel=3	SPROP:Bulk=L		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|2	SPROP:[CAPACITY: 10; TEMP HP: 1; FAST HEALING: 1; FORTIFICATION: 0%%] You can activate or deactivate your armor's force field as a standard action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light (including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can't eat or drink. While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted from the force field's temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field's temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field's color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round. More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit's damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade.
Backup generator			KEY:Armor (Backup generator)			TYPE:Armor	COST:2100												BONUS:VAR|Bulk|1								SPROP:ItemLevel=4	SPROP:Bulk=1		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:You can connect charged electric items such as batteries to this miniature generator to recharge them. The electricity comes from the kinetic energy of your movement, which generates 1 charge every 10 minutes of movement. No more than one item can be plugged in at a time, and the generator doesn't produce charges when you're resting or otherwise stationary.
Exit pod				KEY:Armor (Exit pod)				TYPE:Armor	COST:1750		PRETYPE:1,Heavy_Armor,Powered_Armor					BONUS:VAR|Bulk|2								SPROP:ItemLevel=4	SPROP:Bulk=2		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:This body harness fits into a suit of powered armor or is built into the frame of heavy armor, allowing you to exit the armor as a move action instead of as a full action. Entering the armor is no faster with an exit pod. This can be installed only in heavy armor or powered armor.
Targeting computer		KEY:Armor (Targeting computer)		TYPE:Armor	COST:2250																						SPROP:ItemLevel=4	SPROP:BULK=-		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:This targeting computer helps you compensate for poor visibility conditions. Ignore concealment on attacks you make. This doesn't have any effect against targets with total concealment.
Electrostatic field, mk 1	KEY:Armor (Electrostatic field (mk 1))	TYPE:Armor	COST:3000																						SPROP:ItemLevel=5	SPROP:BULK=-		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:This field over your armor grants you electricity resistance 5, and any creature that touches you or deals damage to you with a melee weapon takes 1d6 electricity damage.
Jetpack				KEY:Armor (Jetpack)				TYPE:Armor	COST:3100		PRETYPE:1,Light_Armor,heavy_Armor					BONUS:VAR|Bulk|1								SPROP:ItemLevel=5	SPROP:Bulk=1		MODIFY:UpgradeSlotTaken|ADD|1	SPROP:[CAPACITY: 40; USAGE: 2/round] You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability).
