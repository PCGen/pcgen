# Ability Name				Category of Ability	Type						Required Ability																																																			Description																												Stackable	Multiple	Choose						Source Page																			BONUS:ASPECT:																																																Benefits

Accelerated Recovery			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PRESTAT:1,CON=13																																																			DESC:Your body knits back together especially quickly while you are resting.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.112																																																																				BENEFIT:You regain twice as many Hit Points when taking an 8-hour rest. In addition, for each uninterrupted 8 hours of rest you receive, you recover from afflictions as though you had rested for a full day. This effect does not stack with other effects that increase these rates of healing and recovery; if more than one would apply, you choose which one takes effect.
Adaptive Casting				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREVARGTEQ:KeyAbilityScore,19			PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=7],[PREVARGTEQ:CasterLevel_Highest,7]																																			DESC:You have a few extra eldritch tricks up your sleeve.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.112																																																																				BENEFIT:[Not Yet Implemented]Select three spells from class spell lists you can cast spells from. They must be at least 1 level lower than the highest spell level you can cast. Once per day, you can cast one of these spells as a spell-like ability. Each time you gain a caster level, you can change which three spells you have selected with this feat.
Adaptive Upgrade				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREMULT:2,[PRESTAT:1,INT=19],[PRESKILL:1,Engineering=10]																																												DESC:You have adjusted one of your armor upgrades to give yourself a few more options.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.112																																																																				BENEFIT:[Not Yet Implemented]Select three armor upgrades, each with an item level no greater than half your ranks in Engineering. If these upgrades require any choices to be made (such as what kind of energy damage they protect against), you must make those choices when you select this feat. With 8 hours of work, you can adapt any armor upgrade of an item level equal to at least half your ranks of Engineering, allowing it to function as one of your three selected upgrades. This upgrade functions only when the upgrade is installed in armor you are wearing. Activating this upgrade requires a move action, after which the upgrade functions as both its normal upgrade and your selected upgrade for 1 minute. If a selected upgrade requires charges, ammunition, or other resources, you must provide them normally; you can add batteries and ammunition to the upgrade as part of the process of adapting it to work with your selected upgrade choices. You can have only one upgrade adapted to be usable with this feat at a time — if you adapt a new upgrade, the adaptations to any previous upgrade are lost. Once you've used your adapted upgrade, you can't use it again until you've regained Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest. Each time you gain another rank in Engineering, you can change the three upgrades you have selected with this feat.
Add Leverage				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat					PRESTAT:1,STR=15																																																			DESC:You hold your weapon using an extra hand (or more) to better push your enemies around.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.112																																																																				BENEFIT:For each hand you use to wield your weapon beyond the minimum required to wield that weapon, you increase the distance you can move your opponent with a successful bull rush or reposition combat maneuver by 5 feet. If you use a trip combat maneuver against a flying opponent, you can increase the distance that creature descends by 5 feet for each additional hand used to wield your weapon. Changing your grip to alter the number of hands you are wielding a weapon with is a swift action. You can't hold items in hands used to add leverage, or use them for any other purpose.
Advanced Warning				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																																										DESC:You shout a warning to your allies, focusing their attention on the threats around them.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.112																																																																				BENEFIT:As a move action, you can shout a warning to your allies, ending the flat-footed condition for any ally within 60 feet. You cannot use this feat when you're flat-footed. Once you've used this ability, you cannot do so again until you've regained Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest. This is a sense-dependent ability.
Ambuscade					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																																										DESC:You are particularly skilled at attacking surprised targets.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.112																																																																				BENEFIT:When you act in a surprise round and attack a target that has not yet acted in the same combat, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack roll and a bonus to damage equal to half your base attack bonus.
Ambush Awareness				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																									DESC:You are particularly skilled at avoiding attacks when surprised.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.112																																																																				BENEFIT:If you are unable to act in the surprise round because you failed a Perception check, you can still act on your initiative count in the surprise round, but only to take the total defense action.
Blood in Their Eyes			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																									DESC:You can deliver carefully placed slashing attacks.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.113																																																																				BENEFIT:When you score a critical hit with a weapon that deals slashing damage, in addition to any other critical hit effect you would normally apply, you also impose the dazzled condition on the target. The condition lasts until ended by any action or effect that would end the bleeding condition.
Constant Alert				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat					PRESTAT:1,WIS=11			PREMULT:1,[PRELEVEL:MIN=5],[PREVARGTEQ:EffectiveLVL,5]																																							DESC:You're always on the lookout for danger, making it hard to get the drop on you.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.113																																																																				BENEFIT:Once per day, you can reroll an initiative check. You also win tied initiative checks as though you had the higher initiative bonus. If multiple characters have this feat, ties are resolved normally.
Cook Grenade				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat					PRESTAT:1,DEX=11			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Proficiency, Grenade Proficiency																																							DESC:You can pull the pin on a grenade and hold onto it until the last second before its detonation, making it harder to avoid.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.113																																																																				BENEFIT:As a full action, you can draw a grenade and make a ranged attack with it. If you do so, the grenade's Reflex save DC is increased by 2. If your attack roll is a natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1), the grenade instead detonates at a randomly determined grid intersection of your space.
Cosmic Truth				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PRESTAT:1,WIS=15			PRESKILL:1,Bluff=5			PRESKILL:1,Mysticism=5																																							DESC:You can reveal one of the mysterious underpinnings of the universe you've learned in your travels, forcing a creature to grapple with the implications.														SOURCEPAGE:p.113																																																																				BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can spend 1 RP to force one creature within 30 feet of you to attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half your ranks in Bluff + your Wisdom bonus); if it fails, it is confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature has seen or heard you use this ability, it is immune to your further uses of the ability for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent, sense-dependent ability.
Deadly Boast				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PRESTAT:1,CHA=19			PRESKILL:1,Bluff=10																																													DESC:You can make an upcoming attack or effect sound so terrifying and dangerous that its targets are actually more likely to be affected by it.																SOURCEPAGE:p.113																																																																				BENEFIT:As a full action, you can describe in great detail how powerful and effective a specific action taken by you or an ally is going to be. You must select a specific character to boast about, and a specific weapon, item, spell, or ability to be used. Attempt a Bluff check against all foes within 60 feet of you, using the same DC you would use if attempting to demoralize them with Intimidate—roll a single check and compare the result to the DC for each target. Each target your check succeeds against takes a –1 penalty to AC and a –2 penalty to saving throws against the action you boasted about until the end of your next turn. Once you have attempted to use this ability against a creature, it is immune to your use of this feat for 24 hours. This is a sense- dependent, language-dependent ability.
Defensive Roll				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat					PRESTAT:1,DEX=19			PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=10																																												DESC:You can dive out of the way of an incoming attack.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.113																																																																				BENEFIT:As a reaction when you are attacked or when you must attempt a Reflex saving throw, you can attempt an Acrobatics check. If you use this ability as a reaction to an attack and your Acrobatics check result exceeds your opponent's attack roll result, the attack misses you. If you use this ability as a reaction when you must attempt a Reflex saving throw, you can use your Acrobatics check result as your Reflex save result. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest. After you use this ability, you are staggered on your next turn.
Dire Straits				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat					PRESTAT:1,CON=15																																																			DESC:You manage to pull through one last time, even when you have nothing left to give.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.113																																																																				BENEFIT:Once per day, when you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and have no Resolve Points remaining, you immediately stabilize.

Dispelling Strike				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREATT:10			PRESKILL:1,Mysticism=10																																														DESC:You can stab, slice, or smash the magic right off of something — or someone.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.114																																																																				BENEFIT:When you are wielding a magic weapon (normally a weapon with a weapon fusion, but anything that bypasses DR/magic qualifies), as a standard action you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast dispel magic for the targeted dispel function. You can use this only against an adjacent target. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.
Double Tap					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat					PREMULT:1,[PREMULT:1,[PREWEAPONPROF:1,TYPE.Small Arms],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Proficiency,Weapon Prof ~ Small Arms]]		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Focus (Small Arms)																								DESC:You can make rapid small arm attacks to increase the effectiveness of your attacks.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.114																																																																				BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can take a single attack action to make a double-tap attack with a small arm. This attack gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll, and your bonus to damage from Weapon Specialization is equal to your character level (rather than half your character level). The small arm used cannot have the blast, explode, flexible line AR , line, unwieldy, or wide line AR weapon special properties, or any other property that allows it to attack multiple targets or an area in a single attack. This attack cannot benefit from the boost, guided AR , or variant boost AR weapon special properties, or any other ability or effect that is a move action and alters the effect of your attack or damage. This expends ammunition equal to two attack rolls, and if you cannot expend that ammunition, you cannot use this ability.
Echolocation Attack			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PRECSKILL:1,Perception																																																		DESC:You have learned to use the echo of sonic attacks to locate unseen assailants.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.114																																																																				BENEFIT:When you take an action that deals sonic damage, as a move action you can grant yourself blindsense (sound) with a range of 30 feet until the end of your next turn.
