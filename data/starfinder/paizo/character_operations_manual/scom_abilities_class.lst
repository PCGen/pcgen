Entropic Pool			KEY:Vanguard Class Feature ~ ENTROPIC POOL		SORTKEY:Vanguard / 001a0	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Vanguard Class Feature.Supernatural	DESC:You have the supernatural ability to control matter as it changes states, allowing you to arrest, accelerate, or even reverse the typical course of events. This energy takes the form of a pool of Entropy Points (EP). You can have a maximum number of EP in your entropic pool equal to your Constitution modifier. You can gain Entropy Points only when involved in a combat encounter that includes a significant enemy (Starfinder Core Rulebook 242). When combat begins, you gain 1 Entropy Point at the beginning of your first action; at the end of combat, you lose any Entropy Points you have remaining. In addition to methods granted by vanguard aspects, you can gain Entropy Points in the followings ways: * While you have no Entropy Points, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to gain 1 EP (2 EP at 10th level). * Each time you take damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP. * If you take damage from a critical hit, you gain 1 EP, in addition to any you gain from the attack's normal damage. * If you score a critical hit on a significant enemy, you gain 1 EP. * If you take a full action to charge, you gain 1 EP. * If you take two move actions on the same turn to move your speed each time, you gain 1 EP. * As a move action, you can designate a willing adjacent ally as an entropic focus. They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of your next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to you or you designate a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If your entropic focus takes damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP. If you are at least 6th level, you can expend a Resolve Point to designate an adjacent, willing ally as your entropic focus as a reaction when they take damage (and gain EP from damage they take from the triggering attack, if appropriate). &nbsp;Entropy Points can be expended in various ways, some of which you gain through vanguard aspects and disciplines. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point in your entropic pool, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your Armor Class. * As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move your speed, you can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it to the speed for any movement type you have). * As a move action, you can expend EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack you make before the start of your next turn. You must decide how many EP to expend when you take this move action, and you can't expend more EP than your level. If the boosted entropic strike hits, you deal +1d4 damage for every EP expended.																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Entropic Strike			KEY:Vanguard Class Feature ~ ENTROPIC STRIKE		SORTKEY:Vanguard / 002a0	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Vanguard Class Feature.Supernatural	DESC:You can focus the power of entropy into a forceful attack. Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike's item level. You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn't use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn't require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function.

Once per day as a standard action, you can touch a willing or unconscious creature. When you do, the affected part of its mind is replaced with a nearly exact duplicate from an alternate reality, ending all mind-affecting effects the target has as well as all conditions removed by greater remove condition that were imposed on the creature by mind-affecting effects. The subject is stunned until the end of its next turn. You can also attempt to use this ability on an ally who is unwilling due to the influence of a mind-affecting effect. In this case, the ally can attempt a new saving throw against the effect at the same DC. If they succeed, the ally can allow their mind to be substituted, but if they fail, you waste the action and this use of substitute mind. This does not grant the ally a new saving throw if the effect did not originally allow one. At 14th level, you can use this ability on yourself, even if you're otherwise unable to take actions because of a mindâ€‘affecting effect.

Shifting Immunity			KEY:Witchwarper Paradigm Shift ~ Shifting Immunity	SORTKEY:Witchwarper / 002a1	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Witchwarper Paradigm Shift.Supernatural																					PREPCLEVEL:MIN=14			DESC:As a reaction when a creature with immunity to a type of energy damage within 100 feet is affected by energy damage, you can change the creature's immunity to another type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) before the damage is resolved. The effect of this paradigm shift lasts for 3 rounds. This does not affect the creature's ability to survive environmental hazards or conditions, only what damage it takes from attacks and special abilities. (For example, a creature normally immune to fire that has its immunity shifted to cold by this ability and then swims in lava still doesn't take damage from the lava even though it's now vulnerable to fire weapons and spells.) The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect. Once you've targeted a creature with this paradigm shift, you can't target that creature with this paradigm shift again for 24 hours. You must know the shift resistance paradigm shift to learn this paradigm shift.	SOURCEPAGE:p.65
Swapping Step			KEY:Witchwarper Paradigm Shift ~ Swapping Step		SORTKEY:Witchwarper / 002a1	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Witchwarper Paradigm Shift.Supernatural																					PREPCLEVEL:MIN=14			DESC:Once per round as a move action, you can switch the positions of two creatures within 100 feet, instantaneously swapping their places. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can't swap creatures' positions in a way that would cause either creature to take damage or be forced into an inappropriate physical space. (For example, you could not swap the positions of two creatures of different sizes if doing so would cause the larger creature to risk falling off a cliff or into a hazard, or cause one of the creatures to be placed within a solid object). Each targeted creature can attempt a Will save to avoid this effect. If either creature succeeds, this paradigm shift has no effect. Once you've targeted a creature with this paradigm shift, you can't target that creature with this paradigm shift again for 24 hours.	SOURCEPAGE:p.65

This causes the creature to gain the stunned condition for 3 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw. This is a mind-affecting effect.

At 17th level, you can instead add the blind, demoralize, wound, sicken, or staggered critical hit effect in place of a second weapon property or a critical hit effect.

When you do this, if you would normally add 1-1/2 times your character level to damage as a special form of specialization (such as from a racial trait such as a vesk's natural weapons), you instead add only your character level to damage.

The DC for this check is equal to 10 + your opponent's total Sense Motive skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 Ã— the opponent's CR, whichever is greater.

Soft Movement			KEY:OPERATIVE EXPLOIT ~ Soft Movement			SORTKEY:Operative / 008a1	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.OPERATIVE EXPLOIT.Extraordinary																																			PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6			DESC:As a full action, you can move up to twice your speed, ignoring difficult terrain. When moving in this way, any liquid or solid surface will support you, regardless of your weight. You can move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches, and environmental circumstances such as the slipperiness of the area you're moving through or the current wind speed do not adjust the DCs of any Acrobatics or Athletics checks you attempt during this movement. While moving this way, you do not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched while moving in this way, such as from lava, and you don't trigger any traps that use a locationbased trigger. This ability doesn't allow you to move across gases or vacuums, nor does it allow you to move across walls or vertical surfaces (though you can do so if you have an ability that allows you to, such as spider climb).

This may be a collection of operatives and spies you have infiltrated, a connection to a formal information broker you trade tidbits of knowledge with, or an assemblage of allies and informants you've carefully curated over your travels. You can make an inquiry to your intelligence network as long as you have access to an infosphere or communication device with at least system-wide range. This gives you the same information you would gain from casting the vision spell, except you make a special class level check (1d20 + your operative level) in place of a caster level check, it does not require a Resolve Point, and it takes 1d4 weeks for your network to get an answer to you. Your network can work on only one question at a time, and if you make a new request before a previous one is fulfilled, all time spend on the original question is lost, and you take a â€“1 penalty to your new class level check due to confusion and lack of focus among your network.

Instead, you can mark for death one opponent within 100 feet that you're aware of as a move action. As long as that target is in sight, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack rolls and the save DC of your operative class features and weapon critical effects against that foe. Marking a target for death focuses all of your attention on that foe, causing you to take a âˆ’2 penalty to AC and Reflex saves against attacks and effects that do not originate from the marked foe. You can end this effect as a swift action or a reaction, and designating another target causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous target. At 7th level, whenever you hit a flat-footed foe that you've marked for death with a trick attack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to force the target to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier). If the target fails this save, any condition you imposed on the target with debilitating trick has a duration of 1 round per operative level you have. If your target succeeds, you still apply all the normal effects of your trick attack. This ability alters specialization and replaces specialization skill mastery.

You must use this ability as part of a move action to move your speed or a withdraw action, and it provides you with one of the following benefits.

Shadow Grenade				KEY:MAGIC HACK ~ Shadow Grenade			SORTKEY:Technomancer / 002a0	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.MAGIC HACK.Supernatural	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=5			DESC:As a standard action, you can create and throw a quasi-real duplicate of a grenade you have in your possession. You don't need to have the grenade in hand, but you do have to have it easily accessible (essentially any grenade that would be a legal target of the Pull the Pin feat). To use this ability, you must expend a spell slot of a spell level equal to at least half the item level of the grenade to be thrown (minimum spell level 1). The shadow grenade acts in all ways like a standard grenade of the type being duplicated, except you are proficient with it, and any creature that makes a saving throw against it is immune to all its effects. If the grenade would not normally allow a saving throw, creatures in its area can attempt a Will save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 your technomancer level + your key ability modifier. This also applies if the grenade requires a saving throw only under specific circumstances that don't apply to a creature. For example, if you use this ability to create a shadow smoke grenade, any creature that inhales the shadow smoke attempts a Fortitude save as outlined in that item's description (Core Rulebook 184) and on a success is immune to all the grenade's effects (including any cover it would grant). Creatures that do not inhale the grenade's shadow smoke are still allowed a Will save, as outlined above, to ignore all the grenade's effects (including cover). You can use this ability to duplicate a grenade with a weapon fusion or fusion seal, but for the purpose of determining the level of the spell slot you must expend to use this ability, treat the grenade's item level as equal to its base item level + the level of any fusions.

If you summon multiple robots with a single creature summoning spell, you select one of them to receive these benefits. You can give it commands if it is within 100 feet of you, as if you had limited telepathy that functioned with the robot. For every 4 caster levels you have, you can select one additional benefit to grant the robot, up to a maximum number of benefits equal to the spell level of the spell you used to summon it. Each time you gain a new technomancer level, you can change what benefits you have selected. When you summon a robot with a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144), you can decide what benefits it receives from those you have selected, up to its maximum. The benefits you can select from include bonus feats and drone mods. The bonus feats you can select from are Blind- Fight, Cleave, Far Shot, Jet Dash, Kip Up, and Mobility.

Translocational Recall			KEY:MAGIC HACK ~ Translocational Recall		SORTKEY:Technomancer / 002a0	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.MAGIC HACK.Supernatural	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8			DESC:As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create a translocational beacon that you place anywhere within your reach. As a swift action, you can instantly teleport from your current location to the location where you placed your translocational beacon, provided the beacon has at least 1 Hit Point and is no further than 10 feet Ã— your technomancer level from your current location. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, although it does create a dazzling flash of neon light (Perception DC 0 to notice). A transdimensional beacon is a Fine object with negligible bulk, hardness equal to your technomancer level, and Hit Points equal to 3 Ã— your technomancer level. Your spell cache monitors your beacon, and you are automatically alerted if it is destroyed or you move out of its range. You can have only one beacon active at a time, and creating a new beacon causes the old beacon to immediately collapse and become inert.		SOURCEPAGE:p.95

You must be able to touch the area, creature, or object affected by the spell that you want to hack. As part of the hack, attempt a Mysticism check with a DC equal to 15 + 1-1/2 Ã— the caster level of the spell. If you succeed, you reduce the spell's duration by 50%%. If this reduces its duration to less time than the effect has already been active, the spell ends as if dispelled. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you can't attempt to hack that spell again for 24 hours. This ability does not affect spells with an instantaneous or permanent duration.																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.93

This magic hack doesn't allow you to cast a spell that you don't know, and you must expend a spell slot of the appropriate level to cast dispel magic or greater dispel magic in this way.

Cache Augmentation			KEY:Technomancer ACF ~ Cache Augmentation				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Technomancer Class Feature.Technomancer Alternate Class Feature												PRECLASS:1,Technomancer=1	DESC:Your studies of the fundamental forces of the galaxy have enabled you to enhance one of your body's systems to benefit from the energy of stored spells. You might have been bestowed this augmentation by an order of technomancers, implanted the augmentation into yourself as part of your research, or witnessed part of your body undergo a technomantic apotheosis that left you with the ability to cast spells. Your cache augmentation takes the form of any cybernetic augmentation or magitech augmentation (Starfinder Armory 90) of your choice with an item level of 1. Each time you gain a level, the item level of your augmentation increases by 1, and you can replace it with a different augmentation with an item level equal to your technomancer level or lower. This augmentation counts toward the total number of augmentations you can have implanted into each of your body's systems as normal. At 6th level, each time you regain your spells, choose one of the following: attack rolls, Computers and Engineering checks, Fortitude saves, or Reflex saves. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of your chosen type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 12th level and +3 at 18th level. At 12th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a second option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of this type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 18th level. At 18th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a third option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of this type. These enhancement bonuses count as part of the effects of your cache augmentation, and if your augmentation is removed or its effects suppressed (such as by the reject augmentation spell; Starfinder Armory 149) you also lose these bonuses. This replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.

Select three magic hacks that you do not have but whose prerequisites you meet. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of one of these magic hacks for 1 minute. You can use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use hack capacitor again before the duration expires, you replace the previous magic hack with the new choice. If a magic hack you chose with hack capacitor has a daily use limitation, any uses of any magic hack from your hack capacitor count toward the hack's daily limit. Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one magic hack you selected with this ability with another choice. At 12th level, select a fourth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of two magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 1 Resolve Point (or 2 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day). Both magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose of this ability, so if you use this ability again during the same day, both magic hacks are replaced. At 18th level, select a fifth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of three magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 2 Resolve Points (or 3 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day).

Some of the cache hacks described below allow you to place spells with targets into your cache capacitor. These spells are marked with an asterisk (*). For such spells, you effectively gain the ability to cast the cached spell at will. You don't need to make any decisions required for the spell in advance, but their duration expires normally. Reestablishing one of these spells requires only that you cast the spell again; you don't need to spend 5 minutes reestablishing it. You can have only one instance of each spell active at a time, and casting the spell again causes the previous instance to automatically end, as if its duration had expired. After 24 hours, you lose the ability to cast the spell in your cache capacitor and effects produced by those spells immediately end, as if their duration had expired.
