ONE WITH THE STREETS		KEY:Street Rat Theme Benefit ~ ONE WITH THE STREETS	SORTKEY:02d_Theme		CATEGORY:Theme		TYPE:Theme.Theme Benefit.Street Rat Theme Benefit.Street Rat Theme Benefit Lvl 18		DESC:Though you may have once craved a quiet, safe existence, you've since grown used to life among the teeming masses, preferably with as few social rules as possible. Being on the streets invigorates you and recharges your reserves. Twice per day while you are in a settlement or within other urban terrain, you can spend 10 minutes wandering around, observing the ebb and flow of citizens, noting where the shadowed alleys are, soaking up the excitement and creativity of your surroundings, and generally feeling the pulse of the city around you. When you do, you regain 1 Resolve Point. This doesn't count as resting to regain Stamina.
