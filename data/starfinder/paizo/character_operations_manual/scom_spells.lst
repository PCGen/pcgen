You then direct this acid rain to pour only onto your enemies, dealing them 3d6 acid damage each round. The acid splashes into and burns your foes' eyes, coats them in slime, and clouds their other senses. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save when exposed to the spell. On a failure, the creature has a 50%% miss chance for its attacks while in the area. The rain causes spellcasters who fail the save to have a 20%% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast from within the area. When this spell ends, a thunderclap causes enemies still in the area who failed their Fortitude saves to be staggered for 1 round.As a standard action, you can change the rain, causing it to deal a different type of energy damage, such as fiery sparks that deal fire damage or shards of ice that deal cold damage. This change in damage types leaves secondary effects unchanged.When the spell ends, the rain leaves no aftereffects.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

This spell has no effect on computers that already have an artificial personality upgrade. You decide the details of the computer's personality when you cast this spell, including its name, mannerisms, and sense of humor. The artificial personality recognizes you as its creator unless you remove that detail from its memory while casting.

You must also target an entire body of fluid, rather than only part of it. If you target an amount of fluid that is too large for you to change entirely, the spell fails and is lost. When you target fluid in this way, you can turn it into potable water, salt water, mildly corrosive acid or base, blood, or any other nontoxic, non-damaging fluid with no other game effects.

If you select continuous memory, you lose those memories, and if you try to recall them, you remember a blank gap instead of any details. If you select a person, place, or object, you remember events related to that thing, but not the presence or details of the thing you named. For example, if after a visit to Castrovel with your sister you use this spell to forget Castrovel, you remember traveling with your sister, but you forget where you went. Alternatively, if you used this spell to forget your sister, you remember going to Castrovel with someone, but not who was with you. Anyone touching the object into which you placed your memories can recall those memories by speaking a command word that you designate at the time of casting.

For the duration, you can warn a creature the target intends to attack, providing that creature with concealment against the attack.

When that target takes an action during the duration, as a reaction you can execute one of the following effects. These effects are resolved after the target declares an intended action but before that action is resolved. The target can attempt a Reflex save to negate your reaction's effect. If the effect successfully interrupts the target's action, that action is still expended unless otherwise noted. Once a target has been successfully affected three times by one casting of this spell, the spell ends. You can attempt each effect only once per casting. DESC: Trip the target. A target tripped after it declares its intent to cast a spell does not lose that spell slot. DESC:  Hinder the target's ranged weapon, imposing a –4 penalty on its next ranged attack roll or a –2 penalty to multiple ranged attack rolls during a full attack. DESC:  Wrench the target's weapon-wielding appendage, imposing a –4 penalty on its next melee attack roll or a –2 penalty on multiple melee attack rolls during a full attack. DESC: Short out an item—whether magic, hybrid, or technological— wasting the target's declared action to activate that item. DESC: Jam a weapon or weapon-like object in place as the target attempts to draw or sheathe it, thwarting that attempt.

One creature takes 1d4 piercing damage and gains bleeding 1 for 3 rounds. You can cast this spell as a full action. If you do, you have two options. You can target two creatures within 20 feet of each other with the effect described above, or target only one creature, who takes 2d4 piercing damage and gains bleeding 2 for 3 rounds.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Once per round, even when it is not your turn, you can move your target up to 10 feet into a space it is willing and able to occupy. This movement can occur only between resolved actions and does not trigger reactions. When you concentrate on this spell, you can shift your focus to a different target.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reality Leap							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:conjuration	DESCRIPTOR:teleportation					CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:long [400 ft. + 40 ft./level]							TARGETAREA:personal																				DURATION:Instantaneous											SAVEINFO:none, Will negates [object]						SPELLRES:no, yes [object]				SOURCEPAGE: pg. 140			DESC:You open an unstable tear in reality and leap into the unknown, emerging at another nearby but unpredictable point in this version of existence. When you cast this spell, you state the direction you wish to travel, the distance within range, and the specific square in which you're trying to arrive. You can bring along objects, provided their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You travel the correct direction and distance, but you have a 50%% chance to arrive elsewhere than your intended square. If you do, use the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram [Starfinder Core Rulebook 245] to determine the direction you deviate from the intended destination. You arrive 1d6 squares away in that direction, although your deviation cannot cause you to exceed this spell's range. If you arrive in a place already occupied by a solid object or body, you take 1d6 damage and are shunted to the nearest open space with a suitable surface.
Remote Operation							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:conjuration										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE: 60 ft.										TARGETAREA:one operable technological device no larger than a vehicle that is not a starship								DURATION:concentration + 1 round/level							SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:yes							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 140			DESC:A holographic duplicate of the target's controls appears within your reach. If the target has no controls, the spell fails. As part of concentrating on this spell, you [and only you] can use these holocontrols to operate the target as if you were able to touch its actual controls. The spell ends if the target moves out of range.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resist Radiation							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:abjuration											CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:medium [100 ft. + 10 ft./level]						TARGETAREA:up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart										DURATION:1 hour/level											SAVEINFO:none [harmless]									SPELLRES:none [harmless]				SOURCEPAGE: pg. 140			DESC:You protect targets from radiation. They succeed at saving throws against low radiation and radiation sickness with a DC of 13 or lower. If the target has radiation sickness with a saving throw DC of 13 or lower, the sickness's effects are suppressed for the duration. Against radiation and radiation sickness with higher save DCs, this spell instead grants targets a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throws.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Security Protocol							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:abjuration											CASTTIME:30 minutes				RANGE:see text										TARGETAREA:one building or starship up to 200 sq. ft./level in size; see text [D]										DURATION:2 hours/level											SAVEINFO:see text											SPELLRES:see text						SOURCEPAGE: pg. 140			DESC:You protect one building or starship you are within by outfitting it with various technological and magical effects. This spell can protect a contiguous area delineated by walls or other enclosed structures, such as part of a large indoor complex, but you must designate the area along the walls or other significant partitions that separate rooms and corridors—the area cannot protect only part of any room or hallway. Once cast, this spell creates the following effects. Effects that allow saving throws or spell resistance say so. Spell effects are treated as if you had cast that spell at your caster level, have a save DC equal to this spell's, and last as long as this spell does. DESC: Confusion: Where choices in direction exist, a minor confusing effect imposes a 50%% chance that the creature goes in a random wrong direction. This is an enchantment, mind- affecting effect. Spell resistance applies. DESC: Doors: Doors you choose are affected as if by security seal. DESC: Fog: Areas you designate are filled with dense fog clouds that obscure the area like a fog cloud spell, up to a number of clouds equal to half your caster level. DESC: Hidden Doors: One door per caster level can be concealed with a 1st-level holographic image that makes it appear to be a plain wall. This effect allows a Will saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, with a DC equal to this spell's DC. DESC: Laser Nets: Areas you designate are protected as if by the laser net spell [see page 137]. This effect allows Reflex saves as described in that spell, with a DC equal to this spell's DC. In addition, when you cast this spell, you can place one of the following effects. -  Dancing lights in four corridors, as the spell. -  Grease in two places. This effect allows Reflex saving throws as described in that spell, with a DC equal to this spell's DC. -  Logic bomb on two computers in the area. This effect allows a Fortitude saving throw as described in that spell, and spell resistance applies. -  A smog bank [see below] in two places.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Share Memory							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:divination											CASTTIME:1 round					RANGE:Touch											TARGETAREA:one willing creature																		DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute/level [D]				SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:yes							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 141			DESC:You allow the target to share a memory with you and up to five other creatures, all of whom must be willing and within 30 feet of the target when you cast this spell. You designate which memories the target shares when you cast this spell, although the target can guide you in this designation. The designated memory can be as specific as "the conversation you just had with the captain" or as vague as "your favorite childhood memory of being with your father." For the duration, those sharing the memory experience it through the target's senses as the target did. Anyone sharing the memory can cease participation at any time. If you end the effect for yourself, or the target ceases sharing, the spell ends. If the memory's length exceeds the duration, it plays out while this spell lasts and then ends with the duration. This spell does not work on memories that have been magically altered or removed through spells such as displace memory [see page 134] or modify memory.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shifting Surge							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Touch											TARGETAREA:one willing creature or object																	DURATION:1 round												SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:yes							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 141			DESC:You touch a willing creature and affect one of its energy damage attacks or weapons, changing the energy damage type of one of its attacks to one other type until the end of your next turn. Even if you don't change the damage, the next affected attack that hits deals 2d6 additional damage if it targets only one target, or 1d6 additional damage if it affects an area or multiple targets.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Each target takes 2d6 damage. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage. You can focus on only one target rather than multiple. If you target only a single creature with this spell, the target is also staggered for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Smog bank obscures sight just as fog cloud does. Living creatures without environmental protections that are in the area when the spell is cast or who enter the area must attempt a Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Spirit-bound Armor						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:necromancy											CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:close [25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels]						TARGETAREA:one suit of armor																			DURATION:1 round/level											SAVEINFO:Will [harmless]									SPELLRES:yes							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 141			DESC:DYou divert a benevolent spirit from the River of Souls to temporarily inhabit a suit of armor. The spirit steadies the nerves and balance of the creature wearing the armor. If the target becomes flat-footed during the duration, it ignores the penalty to AC that condition imposes. Similarly, the off-kilter condition has no effect on the target while this spell is in effect. |!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spirit-bound Computer						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:necromancy											CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Touch											TARGETAREA:one computer system																		DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute/level					SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:yes							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 142			DESC:You divert a benevolent spirit from the River of Souls to inhabit a computer.

Transfer Consciousness						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:divination											CASTTIME: 1 round					RANGE:Touch											TARGETAREA:one computer or willing technological construct; see text												DURATION:10 minutes/level [D]									SAVEINFO:Will negates										SPELLRES:yes							SOURCEPAGE: pg. 142			DESC:You transfer your mind into a computer or technological construct. If you transfer your mind into a computer, its tier can be no higher than half your caster level. If you transfer into a construct, it must be willing or, if nonsapient, not hostile to you. The construct's CR or level can be no higher than your caster level. While your mind is in a computer system, you have direct control over its commands. You can perform Computers checks related to that system in half the usual time. If you transfer your mind into a technological construct, you have access to its functions, allowing you to control the creature directly. You can't cast the construct's spells or use its spell-like or supernatural abilities. You can cast your own spells. While this spell lasts, your body falls prone and helpless, as if you were unconscious. When the spell ends, your mind transfers back to your body instantly, provided your body and the target are on the same plane. Otherwise, you die.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Transport Passengers						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME: 1 minute				RANGE:Touch											TARGETAREA:one vehicle or Tiny starship; see text															DURATION:1 hour/level											SAVEINFO:none [object]										SPELLRES:no [object]					SOURCEPAGE: pg. 142			DESC:You create an extradimensional space in the passenger area of a vehicle or Tiny starship, allowing it to carry one additional Medium creature per caster level. This spell must be cast on a vehicle able to carry more than one passenger, or the spell fails. The extradimensional space appears in the vehicle's seating area or the starship's bridge or passenger section, and it looks like a thin, glowing gap in reality. Creatures that step through this gap are shunted into the extradimensional space, which appears to be and functions as another compartment in the vehicle. A creature can exit the extradimensional space as part of a move action to move through the gap in reality, though a creature cannot exit the extradimensional space unless room to accommodate it exists in the normal seating area. Creatures that are encumbered or overburdened cannot enter the extradimensional space. If a creature is larger than Medium, each size category counts as one additional creature for determining the capacity of the extradimensional space. Creatures within the extradimensional space can't interact with anything outside the vehicle, nor can creatures outside the vehicle perceive or interact with occupants and contents of the space. If the vehicle is destroyed or the extradimensional space is dispelled, the extradimensional space collapses. Anything within the extradimensional space when the vehicle or starship is destroyed, the space is dispelled, or this spell ends are shunted to the nearest open spaces outside the target.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Unspeakable Presences						TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:long [400 ft. + 40 ft./level]							TARGETAREA:60-ft. radius																			DURATION:1 round/level [D]										SAVEINFO:none; see text									SPELLRES:No								SOURCEPAGE: pg. 142			DESC:You swap the space beneath your enemies with the gnashing maws, tentacles, and claws of hideous beasts from another reality. A foe in the area takes 4d6 damage per round and cannot move until it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw, which it can attempt at the end of each of its turns. At that point, the opponent can be affected again only if it leaves the spell's area and then returns. A creature that takes damage from this spell 3 rounds in a row must succeed at a Fortitude save or be consumed by the unspeakable presences. That creature dies, and when the spell ends, its body and gear disappear into the realities from whence the presences came. This is a death effect. Only miracle, warp reality, and wish can bring back a creature slain this way. |!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Usher Apocalypse							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:illusion		DESCRIPTOR:shadow							CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:long [400 ft. + 40 ft./level]							TARGETAREA:60-ft. radius																			DURATION:1 round/level [D]										SAVEINFO:Will disbelief and Reflex partial; see text		SPELLRES: yes					SOURCEPAGE: pg. 142			DESC:You create a quasi-real apocalypse to tear through the area, causing several effects. When the spell first takes effect, illusory hellfire crashes to the ground, dealing 6d6 fire damage to your enemies in the area. Creatures can attempt a Will saving throw to disbelieve the fiery vision and take only half damage. Then, for the duration, two more effects continue. An illusion makes the ground appear to be unstable crust over lava, which your foes treat as difficult terrain. Grasping hands appear to reach out from the ground to grab at enemies. Each time an enemy starts its turn in the area, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be unable to leave its space for the turn.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vigilant Junkbot							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:transmutation										CASTTIME:1 round					RANGE:Touch											TARGETAREA:1 bulk of inert electronic equipment; see text														DURATION:1 round/level											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No								SOURCEPAGE: pg. 143			DESC:You turn the target into a robot that can guard you. This spell works like handy junkbot insofar as targeting parameters and your inability to target the same equipment after the spell ends. The junkbot you create is Tiny and appears in your space. A vigilant junkbot can take no actions. Instead, you instruct the junkbot to perform its melee protocol or ranged protocol. You can change the protocol telepathically as a move action. In its melee protocol, the junkbot attaches to you, granting you a +1 bonus to KAC for every 4 technomancer levels you have. In its ranged protocol, the vigilant junkbot hovers at strategic angles to cover you, granting you concealment against ranged attacks. Additionally, when you take damage from an attack that matches the protocol [melee or ranged], the junkbot takes the first 3 damage. Any additional damage passes to you. Enemies can target the junkbot instead of you. Its KAC and EAC are each 10 + your caster level, and it has Hit Points equal to one-quarter of your own [but no Stamina Points]. The junkbot uses your saving throw bonuses, and it is a construct with the magical and technological subtypes.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Warp Reality							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:universal											CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:see text										TARGETAREA:see text																				DURATION:see text												SAVEINFO:see text											SPELLRES:see text						SOURCEPAGE: pg. 143			DESC:Beckoning to all realities at once, you pull in new possibilities and alter your world to suit you. A warp reality spell can produce one of the following effects. D Duplicate any witchwarper spell of 6th level or lower. D Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower. D Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind. D Produce an effect of a power level in line with the above. At the GM's discretion, warp reality can produce greater effects but can be dangerous or might have only a partial effect. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 7th-level spell. For other effects based on spell level, warp reality is a 9th-level spell.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
