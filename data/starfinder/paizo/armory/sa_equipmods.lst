#WEAPON FUSIONS
ACCURATE		KEY:Weapon (ACCURATE)			TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The accurate fusion bestows exceptional balance and handling on a weapon. When you take a move action to aim a weapon with this fusion at a specific target, you gain a +1 bonus to your next attack roll with that weapon provided neither you nor your target has moved since you aimed. You also gain this bonus if you take a move action to aim for other purposes, such as aiming a weapon with the sniper special property. Only ranged weapons can benefit from this fusion.
ADVANCING		KEY:Weapon (ADVANCING)			TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:When you defeat a foe, a weapon with the advancing fusion draws you further into the fray. The first time each round that you make a successful melee attack with an advancing weapon that drops a foe (by killing it or rendering it unconscious), you can take a guarded step as a reaction. This movement must move you closer to at least one foe.
BENEFICENT		KEY:Weapon (BENEFICENT)			TYPE:Weapon		!PRETYPE:1,EQMOD=Weapon (UNHOLY)		SPROP:When you score a critical hit against a significant enemy with a weapon that has the beneficent fusion, you gain one charge of beneficence. As long as you are wielding the same weapon, you can expend a charge of beneficence to cast either remove affliction or lesser remove condition as a spell-like ability, using the weapon's item level as your caster level. You cannot have more than one charge of beneficence at a time, and you lose all charges of beneficence if you take a 10 minute rest and spend a Resolve Point to regain your Stamina Points or if you take an 8-hour rest and regain your daily-use abilities and spells. If the weapon with the beneficent fusion has an item level of 14 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast remove condition. If the weapon has an item level of 19 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast greater remove condition. A weapon cannot have the beneficent weapon fusion if it also has the unholy or wounding weapon fusions.
BOMBARDING		KEY:Weapon (BOMBARDING)			TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The bombarding fusion allows a weapon to duplicate the effect of a single grenade that is loaded into an extradimensional space within the weapon. Loading a grenade into a weapon with the bombarding fusion takes a full round, as does removing a previously loaded grenade. A grenade loaded into a weapon with the bombarding fusion cannot have an item level greater than the weapon's item level. The grenade cannot be detonated, sundered, or otherwise affected while it is within this extradimensional space, and if the weapon is destroyed or gains the broken condition, the grenade is permanently destroyed. &nl;Once per day, a weapon with the bombarding fusion can launch a mystic version of the loaded grenade. This acts as throwing the grenade, and uses the same proficiency and range increment as throwing a grenade, but does not require a free hand. As long as you are wielding a weapon with the bombarding fusion and it has not yet used this ability, you can launch the grenade as a ranged attack. Once this ability has been used, the loaded grenade can be removed from the extradimensional space, but a new grenade cannot be loaded into it until 24 hours have passed. 
CHARGE DISRUPTING		KEY:Weapon (CHARGE DISRUPTING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:A weapon with the charge disrupting fusion disrupts power sources. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the charge disrupting fusion, either the target or a single visible object carried by the target is subject to discharge, as the spell. The target creature (or its bearer, in the case of an object) can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect, as normal. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the charge disrupting effect.
CONSERVING		KEY:Weapon (CONSERVING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:Weapons with the conserving fusion preserve their ammunition and charges after a miss. When you miss with a ranged attack roll, your charge or ammunition is not consumed, as though the weapon had never been fired. This fusion does not prevent your weapon from malfunctioning or breaking as a consequence of your attack. Only weapons that use arrows, batteries, darts, flares, grenade arrows, mini-rockets, rounds, or scattergun shells as ammunition can benefit from a conserving fusion.
CONTINUOUS		KEY:Weapon (CONTINUOUS)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The continuous fusion lets a weapon with the line special property sustain fire continuously by expending additional charges. When you make a line attack with a weapon with this fusion, you can expend additional ammunition or charges equal to the weapon's usage value to sustain your attack until the start of your next turn. This has no additional effect on targets already within the line, but anything that moves across your weapon's line is attacked using your original attack roll and damage. If you hit but fail to damage this new target, it blocks your line as normal. If an existing blockage is removed, your line extends out to its maximum range unless blocked anew, and it can damage creatures and objects that it failed to reach previously. You can't damage a single target more than once in a round with the continuous fusion, even if it moves in and out of the path of your attack. If you move from where you initiated the attack for any reason, your line automatically ends. Only weapons that can make a line attack benefit from this fusion. You can use the continuous fusion with unwieldy weapons.
CRUEL		KEY:Weapon (CRUEL)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The cruel fusion feeds on fear and despair. When you strike a target that is frightened, panicked, or shaken with a weapon with this fusion, the target is sickened for 1 round. When you make a successful attack that drops a foe (either by killing it or knocking it unconscious), you gain 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes. Weapons with the nonlethal special property cannot benefit from the cruel fusion.
DEFENDING		KEY:Weapon (DEFENDING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:Weapons with the defending fusion aid their wielder when blocking or fighting defensively. When you fight defensively while attacking with a weapon with this fusion, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with the weapon (effectively reducing the penalty from fighting defensively to -3) and an additional +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. Additionally, if your weapon has the block weapon special property, increase the enhancement bonus to your AC against melee attacks from that target to +2. Only melee weapons can benefit from this fusion.
ENERGETIC		KEY:Weapon (ENERGETIC)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:A projectile weapon with the energetic fusion relies on energy rather than physical ammunition to generate kinetic attacks. Instead of being loaded with darts, rounds, or scattergun shells, the weapon is loaded with a battery. The type of battery the projectile weapon uses depends on its original capacity as follows: 1-20 use batteries, 21-40 use high-capacity batteries, 41-80 use super-capacity batteries, and 81 or more use ultracapacity batteries. The weapon's usage does not change, but it takes charges from the installed battery, rather than expending physical ammunition. The fusion converts the energy into physical bullets which target KAC and deal damage normally for the weapon. Only weapons in the projectile category that would normally use darts, rounds, or scattergun shells can benefit from the energetic fusion.
ENSNARING		KEY:Weapon (ENSNARING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The ensnaring fusion binds the target on a critical hit. On a critical hit with this weapon, you can apply the entangle weapon special property (Core Rulebook 181). The entangle effect ends after 1 minute if the target has not already escaped it. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the entangle effect. If you successfully affect a target with both the entangling and ensnaring fusions on the same attack roll, only the ensnaring fusion applies, and your use of the entangling fusion is not consumed. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, cold, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.
GUARDED		KEY:Weapon (GUARDED)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The guarded fusion guides timing so that ranged attacks don't leave the wielder vulnerable. When you make a ranged attack using a weapon with this fusion, your attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The guarded fusion does not prevent attacks of opportunity provoked for any reason other than making a ranged attack. Only ranged and thrown weapons can benefit from this fusion.
INSPIRING		KEY:Weapon (INSPIRING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The inspiring fusion imbues a weapon with hope. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the inspiring fusion, you and all allies within 60 feet gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against attacks, effects, and spells from the target of your attack for 1 minute. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the inspiring effect.
INVIGORATING		KEY:Weapon (INVIGORATING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The invigorating fusion fills its wielder with vigor when defeating foes. After making a successful attack with this weapon that drops a foe (by killing it or rendering it unconscious), you feel a rush of energy that eliminates the fatigued condition and reduces exhaustion to fatigue. If you were neither exhausted nor fatigued, you instead gain a +3 morale bonus to Strength-, Dexterity- and Constitution-based ability checks and skill checks, and you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your speed for all of your modes of movement until the end of your next turn.
LIMNING		KEY:Weapon (LIMNING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:Successful attacks with a weapon with the limning fusion surround the target with a glowing aura. For 1 round after you successfully attack a single creature with your weapon, it is surrounded by a pale glow that reveals its location. While so illuminated, the creature takes a -20 penalty to Stealth checks and does not benefit from concealment provided by darkness, invisibility, smoke, and similar effects. However, displacement and other effects that shift location entirely are not negated. The light is too dim to harm creatures vulnerable to light and does not serve to illuminate anything but the creature affected by limning. Limning weapons create glows in a variety of hues, and some even bestow a variety of colors. The limning fusion has no effect on attacks that affect multiple foes.
MALEDICTION		KEY:Weapon (MALEDICTION)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:Once per day when you successfully attack a foe with a weapon with the malediction fusion, as a reaction you can cast bestow curse on the target as a spell-like ability (using the weapon's item level as the caster level). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the weapon with this fusion has an item level of 14 or higher you may use this ability twice per day, and if it has an item level of 19 or higher you may use this ability three times per day. A weapon cannot have the malediction fusion if it also has either the holy or merciful weapon fusions.
MENACING		KEY:Weapon (MENACING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:A weapon with the menacing fusion aggressively pushes against your foe's guard, making way for other attackers. When you hit an enemy with a melee attack using a menacing weapon, that enemy is considered flanked for all other melee attackers until the start of your next turn. This weapon fusion does not provide any benefit to your own attacks. Only melee weapons can benefit from the menacing fusion.
MIND RENDING		KEY:Weapon (MIND RENDING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:Scoring a critical hit with a weapon with the mind rending fusion damages the psyche of the creature struck. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save; otherwise, roll on the Psychic Trauma table to determine how the target creature is affected. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or a psychic trauma (Table 1-13 on p. 64). Psychic trauma is a mindaffecting effect. While each psychic trauma exploits a potential neurosis, the trauma does not cause actual insanity. The effects of psychic trauma can be removed with the remove affliction spell (DC = 15 + half the item level of the mind rending weapon).
NULLIFYING		KEY:Weapon (NULLIFYING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:Damage from a weapon with the nullifying fusion temporarily reduces spell resistance. When you damage a creature with spell resistance using a weapon with this fusion, its spell resistance is reduced by 2 until the end of your next turn. Multiple hits from weapons with this fusion stack.
OBSCURING		KEY:Weapon (OBSCURING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:A weapon with the obscuring fusion emits mist, smoke, or a similar obscuring vapor when wielded. After attacking with the weapon, as a move action you can cause the weapon to emit enough vapor to conceal you until the start of your next turn. This effect ends immediately if you move for any reason from where you made your attack. This concealment does not interfere with your attacks or benefit others, even if they move into the space you attacked from, and you can't use it to hide. Conditions such as strong wind or vacuum that quickly disperse vapors negate this concealment. Only projectile weapons or those that deal cold or fire damage can benefit from this fusion.
OPPORTUNISTIC		KEY:Weapon (OPPORTUNISTIC)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The opportunistic fusion guides your accuracy when making attacks of opportunity and leaves your foes vulnerable to your attack. You gain a +2 bonus to attacks of opportunity made with this weapon. If your attack of opportunity hits, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll for that attack of opportunity. This damage increases by 1 if the weapon is item level 5, and by an additional 1 for every 5 item levels thereafter. Only melee weapons can benefit from this fusion.
POTENT		KEY:Weapon (POTENT)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The potent fusion boosts the DC of saving throws associated with the weapon. When you attack using a weapon with this fusion, increase the DC for saving throws against the weapon's critical hit effects, other weapon fusions, weapon special properties, and any effect delivered by the weapon (such as an injected poison) by 1.
PUNISHING		KEY:Weapon (PUNISHING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:Subsequent wounds from a weapon with the punishing fusion have greater effect. When you damage a creature with the weapon, you receive a +1 bonus to damage against that target with this weapon until the end of your turn. If you successfully damage the same creature with this weapon multiple times in the same round, the bonus increases by 1 on each additional attack. If you damage a creature with this weapon when it isn't your turn, such as with an attack of opportunity, the bonus lasts until the end of your next turn after the attack.
PUNISHING		KEY:Weapon (PUNISHING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The rebounding fusion lets you bounce your attacks off a wall to reach your target. When making a ranged attack, you can ricochet your attack off a single solid barrier into your target. You take a -4 penalty to your attack roll. You must have line of sight to your target, and your target still benefits from any applicable concealment. Calculate cover based on the point you ricochet from. The fusion prevents any damage to the barrier and allows you to carom shots at apparently impossible angles. You can't ricochet off a barrier your weapon would automatically pass through, such as rebounding a laser off a transparent surface, but you can ricochet off a barrier that your weapon would normally destroy. A thrown weapon with both the rebounding and returning fusions returns as normal, rebounding off the barrier again on its way back to you. Only thrown and ranged weapons can benefit from this fusion.
SECURED		KEY:Weapon (SECURED)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The secured fusion ties the weapon to a single owner. When you use your weapon, it functions normally, but when wielded by any other, it remains inert and useless. Any analog, nonmagical properties of the weapon that do not require ammunition or charges still function, so a club would still be a club, but a pistol becomes merely an improvised weapon. Only the person who places a secured fusion seal on a weapon can remove it from that weapon. Once removed, the fusion seal can be affixed to a new weapon by a new owner. Even if not the owner, a character trained in Mysticism can remove an installed secured fusion or fusion seal using a process similar to transferring a fusion (Core Rulebook 191). For a fusion, this costs half as much as purchasing the fusion for the weapon on which it is currently installed; for a seal, this is half the cost of the seal itself. The process takes 8 hours. Afterward, a fusion can be installed on a new weapon and assigned a new owner for the installation cost, and a fusion seal can be used normally.
SELECTIVE		KEY:Weapon (SELECTIVE)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:With the selective weapon fusion, you can exclude a single target from a weapon's area of effect. When using a selective weapon to make an automatic, blast, explode, line, or other form of area attack that affects multiple targets, you can choose a single target to leave out of the area of effect.
SOULFIRE		KEY:Weapon Crystal (SOULFIRE)		TYPE:Weapon		SOURCEPAGE:p.65		SPROP:The soulfire fusion (and soulfire fusion seals) can only be applied to solarian weapon crystals. When you hit a target with a solar weapon augmented by a solarian weapon crystal with the soulfire fusion, you add your Charisma bonus to the damage done, in addition to your Strength bonus.		BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|CHA|TYPE=Enhancement
STABILIZING		KEY:Weapon (STABILIZING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The stabilizing fusion helps you keep your orientation in zero gravity. While wielding such a weapon, you can steady yourself even if you don't have a surface to grab onto or a means of propulsion. If you do have such means, you can steady yourself as either a move action or a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus to checks to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. Only melee weapons, small arms, and long arms can benefit from the stabilizing fusion.
THROWING		KEY:Weapon (THROWING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The throwing fusion makes even the most cumbersome melee weapon usable as a thrown weapon. A melee weapon with this fusion gains the thrown special property with a range increment of 10 feet. If the weapon has an item level of 10 or higher, the range increment is 20 feet. This fusion allows you to add additional fusions that benefit thrown weapons. You must be proficient with a melee weapon with the throwing fusion in order to benefit from the thrown special property granted by it. Only melee weapons can benefit from the throwing fusion.
TRACKING		KEY:Weapon (TRACKING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The tracking fusion lets you locate a creature recently damaged by the weapon. Activating the fusion is a move action that binds the tracking fusion to the first creature you damage with the weapon before the start of your next turn. Once you track a target with this fusion, you are aware of the target's location as long as it is within 1,000 feet and you keep the weapon with this fusion in hand. &nl;If the target is further away, you can attempt a Perception check (opposed by the target creature's Stealth check) to know approximately what direction the creature is in, though not accurately enough to triangulate its exact location. This is considered a magic divination. The tracking effect is removed if the target travels more than 10 miles away from you, the target changes planes, the effect is dispelled, you fail a Perception check to know its general distance by 10 or more, or 24 hours have passed since you last damaged the target with this weapon. For the purposes of dispelling the tracking effect, treat the effect as a spell with a caster level equal to the weapon's item level. You can track only one creature at a time. Activating the tracking weapon fusion again automatically ends any previous binding. Only attacks made by the weapon against a single target can benefit from this fusion.
VANISHING		KEY:Weapon (VANISHING)		TYPE:Weapon		SPROP:The vanishing fusion can hide its wielder from the sight of one foe. Once per day after making an attack with your weapon, regardless of whether you hit your target, you can become invisible to that target per invisibility for a number of rounds equal to the weapon's item level. Any attacks you make (even against other targets) end your invisibility as normal. All creatures other than the target continue to be able to see you normally. Only small arms and weapons with the operative special property can benefit from this fusion.
