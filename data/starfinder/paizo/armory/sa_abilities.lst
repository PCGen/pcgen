Sustained by Science		KEY:Augmented ~ Sustained by Science		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Archetype Class Feature		DESC:Your technological components from augmentations grant you extraordinary resilience. Whenever you spend one or more Resolve Points, you gain an equal number of charges as though your body were a battery with a maximum capacity equal to the number of augmentations you have. You can use these charges to power any device that you own, and any unused charges disappear at a rate of 1 charge per 10 minutes. This excess energy can be used only to directly power an object, and not to recharge a battery or item.&nl;When calculating how many Resolve Points you must spend to stabilize, subtract half your number of augmentations from your maximum Resolve Points. When you spend any Resolve Points to stabilize, you can also attempt a saving throw against one bleeding or burning condition affecting you against the effect's original DC (or if there was no save, a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the source's CR). If you succeed at the save, the condition ends.		SOURCEPAGE:P.143

You don't need a disguise kit to attempt a Disguise check to change your appearance when using this expertise talent, though using one grants you a +2 bonus to your check. If you forgo rolling your expertise die, changing your appearance takes only 1d3 minutes rather than 1d3 x 10 minutes.&nl;Alternatively, if you have the materials that qualify for you to use this expertise talent, you may forgo your expertise die to attempt to disguise yourself as that exact creature. Anyone who knows that creature well gains a +10 bonus to Perception checks to oppose your disguise.		SOURCEPAGE:p.145

SOURCEPAGE:p.146
Tech Tinkerer		KEY:Mechanic Trick ~ Tech Tinkerer		CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Extraordinary.Mechanic Trick.Mechanic Trick LVL 2	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2		DESC:You know how to modify the functions of UPBs to radically alter how items work. With 10 minutes of work, you can modify a technological item so that it temporarily functions as any other lower-level technological item of the same or lower bulk (losing its original function while in this new form). The item must have an item level and bulk no greater than half your mechanic level. If the new item requires a battery that has more charges than the original device's battery (or another source of power or fuel not present in the original item), you must also provide the appropriate battery or power source. Any charges or similar expenditure from the new item come from the original item (if possible) or the new power source you install (if one was required). The new item retains the original item's bulk. Any damage dealt to the new item is retained when it returns to its original form. If the item is broken or destroyed in its modified form, it remains broken or destroyed when it returns to its original form and must be repaired or replaced normally. &nl;This change lasts for 10 minutes per mechanic level or until you undo it with 10 minutes of work. You cannot modify or produce armor, augmentations, hybrid or magic items, items with limited uses or charges (such as batteries, drugs, or fuel), or weapons, although you can produce an item that uses charges from a battery or fuel if there is a separate battery or power source to power it. At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability to modify an item whose level is equal to your mechanic level, giving it the function of a lower-level item.		SOURCEPAGE:p.146

You can turn a weapon into another weapon or an armor upgrade into another armor upgrade, or turn either a weapon or an armor upgrade into a technological item. If you turn a weapon into another weapon that uses a different type of ammunition, you must provide that ammunition separately. You must have the tech tinkerer mechanic trick to learn this trick.		SOURCEPAGE:p.146
Recalibrate Weapon		KEY:Mechanic Trick ~ Recalibrate Weapon		CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Extraordinary.Mechanic Trick.Mechanic Trick LVL 8	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8		DESC:As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to modify a touched ranged small arm, longarm, or heavy weapon. You can increase its range increment by 20 feet (or double, whichever is less), but doing so reduces the weapon's damage dice by 1 when wielded by anyone other than you (for example, a weapon that would normally deal 3d8 damage deals 2d8 damage instead; a weapon reduced to 0 dice does 1 damage) or reduce its save DC by 2 for weapons that don't use damage dice. You can instead reduce the range increment of such a weapon with a range increment of at least 40 feet to one-quarter its normal range and either increase its damage by 1d6 of its usual type or increase its save DC by 1 (for weapons that do not use damage dice). The item must be unattended or held by a willing creature. This change lasts for 1 minute per mechanic level or until you reverse the effect with a move action. &nl;Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single non-capital weapon. You either extend or shorten the weapon's range by one step; doing so reduces its damage dice by 1 (such as 4d4 to 3d4, with weapons reduced to 0 dice doing 1 damage) or increases its damage by 1d6, respectively. You can't reduce a weapon's range below short or extend it beyond long. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level or until you undo the recalibration as a push engineer action.

If the mod grants the drone abilities, attacks, or senses, you can use that ability, attack, or sense. If the mod lets the drone take an action without you commanding it to (such as the medical subroutine mod), the drone can end the drone meld and perform that action if the circumstances that would normally cause it to do so are fulfilled. If the mod requires equipment or tools that are not granted as part of the mod, you must have the appropriate equipment or tolls, separate from your drone, to use the mod. You can't choose a mod that requires another mod. You must have the drone meld mechanic trick to learn this trick.		SOURCEPAGE:p.147

Personal Modification		KEY:Geneturge Connection Power ~ Personal Modification		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Connection Power.Geneturge Connection Power.Geneturge Connection Power LVL 1.Class Feature.Extraordinary	DESC:You gain a personalized biotech augmentation that is keyed to your genetic code. Your body synthesizes the organic material for the augmentation and you magically manipulate your DNA strands to integrate it into the biological system of your choice. Once implanted, the personal augmentation occupies that system, preventing the installation of any other upgrade, and you can only remove or implant the augmentation in a new system through the transform biotech class feature (see below). The personal augmentation provides a benefit based on which of your body's systems you implant it in: arms, brain, ears, eyes, feet, hands, heart, legs, lungs, skin, spinal column, or throat.

You can permanently transfer your personal modification to a different biological system, changing its granted benefit, as long as the new system isn't already occupied by a modification. Alternatively, you can cause a biotech augmentation you have had installed to function as your personal modification would if it were installed in that system, suppressing the normal functions of that augmentation but allowing you to gain the benefits of your personal modification for that system (in addition to the system your personal modification currently occupies). As a third option, you can temporarily alter one of your biotech augmentations. When you activate the transform biotech ability in this way, select one of your existing biotech augmentations that required you to make a choice when it was installed, such as the type of damage dealt by a dragon gland (Core Rulebook 211). You can select a new option for this augmentation as if it were newly installed.		SOURCEPAGE:p.148

This requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration. You hijack the power within the gem by inserting your own spellcode, replacing the spell originally encoded within the gem with one of your spells known of an equal or lower level. You can't insert a replacement spell with expensive material components or that requires the expenditure of Resolve Points unless the original spell required components of equal or greater value or the same amount of Resolve Points. If you use this ability on a compound spell gem, it affects only one spell contained within the gem, leaving the other spell or spells intact. Once you have used this ability, you cannot recode another spell gem until you rest for 10 minutes and expend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points.		SOURCEPAGE:p.156
