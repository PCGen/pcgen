When you purchase and install an augmentation with an item level no greater than your character level into that system, you reduce the augmentation's price by 50%%.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:P.143
#TODO: add mechanics
Nested Augmentations						KEY:Augmented ~ Nested Augmentations									CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Archetype Class Feature																																																																						DESC:Whether it's because your body is especially receptive to modification or you're able to adjust your modifications to fit alongside one another, you can use more augmentations at once than other creatures can. You can install one additional augmentation into one system that already has an augmentation. You can have no more than two augmentations in that system, even if you have another ability that grants you a similar benefit.

Sustained by Science						KEY:Augmented ~ Sustained by Science									CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Archetype Class Feature																																																																						DESC:Your technological components from augmentations grant you extraordinary resilience. Whenever you spend one or more Resolve Points, you gain an equal number of charges as though your body were a battery with a maximum capacity equal to the number of augmentations you have. You can use these charges to power any device that you own, and any unused charges disappear at a rate of 1 charge per 10 minutes. This excess energy can be used only to directly power an object, and not to recharge a battery or item.&nl;When calculating how many Resolve Points you must spend to stabilize, subtract half your number of augmentations from your maximum Resolve Points. When you spend any Resolve Points to stabilize, you can also attempt a saving throw against one bleeding or burning condition affecting you against the effect's original DC (or if there was no save, a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the source's CR). If you succeed at the save, the condition ends.

As a swift action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to choose one personal upgrade (Starfinder Core Rulebook 212) you have and gain a temporary benefit based on the ability score it augments. The benefit increases based on the model type, treating mk 1 as 1, mk 2 as 2, and mk 3 as 3 for the purpose of calculating the effect. At 13th level you can gain the associated benefits for two of your personal upgrades, and at 17th level you can gain the associated benefits for up to three of your personal upgrades. These benefits last for a number of rounds equal to your character level.

The DC for the check is based on the medical equipment used, using the DC for treat deadly wounds + 5. This does not count as the treat deadly wounds treatment for the purposes of how many times per day a creature can receive this treatment, though a creature can only benefit from battlefield medic once per day. If you also have the surgeon expertise talent, you can increase the DC of a battlefield medic-related Medicine check by a total of 10 to use battlefield medic to treat deadly wounds on a creature one additional time per day (which does not count as a use of the surgeon expertise talent).

SOURCEPAGE:p.146
Tech Tinkerer		KEY:Mechanic Trick ~ Tech Tinkerer		CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Class Feature.Mechanic Trick.Extraordinary.Mechanic Trick LVL 2	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2		DESC:You know how to modify the functions of UPBs to radically alter how items work. With 10 minutes of work, you can modify a technological item so that it temporarily functions as any other lower-level technological item of the same or lower bulk (losing its original function while in this new form). The item must have an item level and bulk no greater than half your mechanic level. If the new item requires a battery that has more charges than the original device's battery (or another source of power or fuel not present in the original item), you must also provide the appropriate battery or power source. Any charges or similar expenditure from the new item come from the original item (if possible) or the new power source you install (if one was required). The new item retains the original item's bulk. Any damage dealt to the new item is retained when it returns to its original form. If the item is broken or destroyed in its modified form, it remains broken or destroyed when it returns to its original form and must be repaired or replaced normally. &nl;This change lasts for 10 minutes per mechanic level or until you undo it with 10 minutes of work. You cannot modify or produce armor, augmentations, hybrid or magic items, items with limited uses or charges (such as batteries, drugs, or fuel), or weapons, although you can produce an item that uses charges from a battery or fuel if there is a separate battery or power source to power it. At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability to modify an item whose level is equal to your mechanic level, giving it the function of a lower-level item.		SOURCEPAGE:p.146
Mobile Armory		KEY:Mechanic Trick ~ Mobile Armory		CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Class Feature.Mechanic Trick.Extraordinary.Mechanic Trick LVL 8	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Class Feature,Mechanic Trick ~ Tech Tinkerer		DESC:You can modify a weapon or armor upgrade (either of which must not be archaic or analog) with the tech tinkerer mechanic trick. You can turn a weapon into another weapon or an armor upgrade into another armor upgrade, or turn either a weapon or an armor upgrade into a technological item. If you turn a weapon into another weapon that uses a different type of ammunition, you must provide that ammunition separately. You must have the tech tinkerer mechanic trick to learn this trick.		SOURCEPAGE:p.146
Recalibrate Weapon		KEY:Mechanic Trick ~ Recalibrate Weapon		CATEGORY:Class Feature		TYPE:Class Feature.Mechanic Trick.Extraordinary.Mechanic Trick LVL 8	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8		DESC:As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to modify a touched ranged small arm, longarm, or heavy weapon. You can increase its range increment by 20 feet (or double, whichever is less), but doing so reduces the weapon's damage dice by 1 when wielded by anyone other than you (for example, a weapon that would normally deal 3d8 damage deals 2d8 damage instead; a weapon reduced to 0 dice does 1 damage) or reduce its save DC by 2 for weapons that don't use damage dice. You can instead reduce the range increment of such a weapon with a range increment of at least 40 feet to one-quarter its normal range and either increase its damage by 1d6 of its usual type or increase its save DC by 1 (for weapons that do not use damage dice). The item must be unattended or held by a willing creature. This change lasts for 1 minute per mechanic level or until you reverse the effect with a move action. &nl;Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single non-capital weapon. You either extend or shorten the weapon's range by one step; doing so reduces its damage dice by 1 (such as 4d4 to 3d4, with weapons reduced to 0 dice doing 1 damage) or increases its damage by 1d6, respectively. You can't reduce a weapon's range below short or extend it beyond long. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level or until you undo the recalibration as a push engineer action.

When the duration expires, the creature reappears in the space it last occupied, or in the closest unoccupied space if its original space is now occupied. To the target creature, it seems as if no time has passed during its absence, and it returns exactly in the state it was when it disappeared, including having the same duration remaining on any spells or effects that were affecting it at the time of its departure. At 17th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you hit a creature with this ability to increase its duration to a number of rounds equal to half your solarian level.
