# Original Entry by: Brad G.
##NOTE: Variable-level spells are listed once for each level they may be cast at, denoted by (Level x), as well as once with no level indicator, for use with SLAs or similar effects.
##All versions should appear on output sheets as having the same name. I did this because the power of these spells is maximized at the highest level one has learned the particular spell at.
##If a caster has only learned Flight as a 3rd level spell, they do not gain the ability to cast it as a 4th or higher level spell.
##Comps are Credits (Cr) or Resolve Points (RP)

###Long Spell Descriptions###
Detect Augmentation.MOD		DESC:You detect the presence of augmentations installed within creatures you can see within the area, which appear to you as glowing outlines around the systems in which the augmentations are installed. The spell allows you to determine the type of augmentation, such as biotech, cybernetic, magitech, or necrotech, and its item level, but it does not reveal the function of the augmentation. This spell does not reveal hidden or invisible creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reject Augmentation.MOD		DESC:You urge the target creature's natural systems to reassert themselves, causing its body to temporarily reject augmentations that have been installed in its systems. For the spell's duration, the creature is sickened and can't use any augmentations that require an action to activate. Creatures that don't have augmentations are not affected by this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Armor.MOD		DESC:You temporarily infuse a suit of armor with a magic force that allows it to move on its own and that directs its mechanisms. When you cast this spell, the armor acts and responds to your mental control for as long as you concentrate. Each round on your turn, the armor can perform either a move action or a standard action to attack. The armor can move up to 30 feet (or its listed speed using any of its available modes of movement, if powered armor or containing an armor upgrade that alters movement). When the armor attacks, it can either make an unarmed attack, dealing 4d8 + your caster level bludgeoning damage (or the listed damage plus its Strength modifier, for powered armor) or make an attack with any of the weapons mounted in its weapon slots or weapons with the integrated special property installed in its upgrade slots (if any); this deals the weapon's base damage for ranged attacks and the weapon's base damage plus the armor's Strength modifier for melee attacks. The armor has a bonus to attacks equal to 6 + your caster level. If the armor has no listed Strength score, it can apply a Strength bonus equal to your caster level. &nl;Should the animated armor be attacked, its EAC and KAC are equal to 10 + the EAC and KAC bonus the armor provides. It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects, and it has the typical hardness and Hit Points for an item of its level. For the purpose of spells and effects that target the armor, it is treated as a construct with the technological and magical subtypes while the spell lasts. &nl;This spell has no effect if cast on powered armor with a depleted battery or powered armor of an item level that exceeds your caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell  
Electroplating.MOD		DESC:When you cast this spell, you create a temporary quantity of silver in a cloud of charged nanoparticles, which you then direct to coat nearby melee or projectile weapons. The target weapons must deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage or the spell has no effect. For the spell's duration, the metal plating on the weapons grants them the ability to overcome DR/silver and bypass DR/magic for the spell's duration. If your caster level is 8th or higher, you can have weapons affected by this spell bypass DR/adamantine rather than DR/ silver. Weapons affected by this version of the spell are not considered adamantine for any other purpose (such as the ability to bypass hardness). If your caster level is 16th or higher, you can instead have affected weapons bypass DR that is bypassed by any other one metal with which you are familiar (either from having succeeded at a skill check to identify the weaknesses of a creature with DR, or from a successful Physical Science skill check to identify some other metal when you encountered it). Such weapons do not gain any other benefit from being made of the selected material.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Incompetence.MOD		DESC:You cause all targets of this spell to lose proficiency with one class of weapons of your choice (basic or advanced melee weapons, small arms, longarms, heavy weapons, grenades, or natural weapons) and suffer the normal penalties for attacks made with weapons they are not proficient with.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
