# Modifier Name		Unique Key				Type					Keys to replace			Source Page		Prohibited Type	Combat bonus				Modify VAR							Weapon prop. bonus												Special Property																																																																																																																																																																																																														Choose																		Define
Finesse			KEY:FINESSE																																																	SPROP:When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
Heavy				KEY:HEAVY																																																	SPROP:Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.|PRESIZELT:M
Light				KEY:LIGHT																																																	SPROP:A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading			KEY:LOADING																																																	SPROP:Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
Range				KEY:RANGE																																																	SPROP:A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
Reach				KEY:REACH																																																	SPROP:This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.
Special			KEY:SPECIAL																																																	SPROP:A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).
Thrown			KEY:THROWN																																																	SPROP:If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
Two-Handed			KEY:TWO-HANDED																																																SPROP:This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
Versatile			KEY:VERSATILE_D8																																																SPROP:Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. (1d8)
Versatile			KEY:VERSATILE_D10																																																SPROP:Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. (1d10)
