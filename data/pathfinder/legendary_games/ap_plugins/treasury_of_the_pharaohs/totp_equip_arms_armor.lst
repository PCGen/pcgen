#SPROP:As a full-round action, the wielder can cause the weapon to grow a haft, allowing it to be wielded as a +2 longspear, +2 shortspear, or +2 spear. Evil creatures gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and a +2 bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with daemons. On a critical hit, can instead inflict the embrace of Set (DC 18 Will negates). If the target fails its save, the blade is destroyed after imparting the curse. Imparting the embrace of Set is an evil act.
Biting Wind				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sling		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Simple.Ranged.Standard.Bludgeoning.Container.Projectile.Sling			CONTAINS:UNLIM|SlingStone	COST:62300	WT:0		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4	EQMOD:Material ~ Leather.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Corrosive Burst ~ Weapon	WIELD:OneHandOnly	MODS:NO			RANGE:50				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8													BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|STR	
#SPROP:When the wielder uses the full attack action, the sling surrounds the wielder with a cyclone that does not harm or impede the wielder but functions as a wind wall for other creatures. Creatures ending their turn adjacent to the wielder while the cyclone is active take 2d6 points of acid damage (DC 14 Reflex negates). The wielder is immune to this damage. The sling can produce this cyclone for a total of 10 rounds per day, though these rounds need not be contiguous.
Desert Moon				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Khopesh		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.OneHanded.Exotic.Standard.Slashing.HeavyBlade.Tengu								COST:10820	WT:8		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Quality ~ Trip.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Frost ~ Weapon		WIELD:OneHanded	MODS:NO								SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																	
#SPROP:Can create a 60-foot-radius emanation of normal temperature, which can be designated by the wielder as any temperature from 40 to 80° F. Can produce water once per hour as create water while in hot environments. Wielders capable of using the Channel Energy class feature can choose to harm outsiders with the fire subtype or heal outsiders with the water subtype with their channeling, as though they have the Elemental Channel feat. The DC on saves to resist these types of channels increases by 2.
Dune Trap Javelin			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Javelin		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Simple.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.Thrown.Javelin.Spear									COST:900	WT:2		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Material ~ Wood.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon			WIELD:OneHandOnly	MODS:NO			RANGE:30				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																	
#SPROP:When thrown at a location of sand or dirt (ranged attack against AC 5) this javelin creates a 10-foot-by-10-foot hole with a depth of 30 feet. Any creature standing where the pit is conjured must make a DC 14 Reflex saving throw to jump to safety in the nearest open space. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The pit’s shifting walls have a Climb DC of 20. The base of the pit rises 5 feet per round until it reaches the surface. The javelin is consumed after use.
Disemboweling Sickle		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sickle		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Simple.Standard.Slashing.Sickle.BladeLight							COST:657506	WT:2		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Quality ~ Trip.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Wounding ~ Weapon		WIELD:Light		MODS:NO								SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																	
#SPROP:When used to perform a successful coup de grace, the wielder and target are affected as death knell, though the wielder may choose to gain a +2 enhancement bonus to any ability score (rather than Strength only). Once per week, a disemboweling sickle can be used as an additional focus for casting create undead, allowing the wielder to animate a corpse with the dread mummy template (as described in the Advanced Bestiary from Green Ronin Press), provided her caster level equals or exceeds the target creature’s Hit Dice in life. The newly created dread mummy is not under the caster’s control, but the caster gains a +4 profane bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks with any dread mummy she animates with the sickle’s aid.
Scarab Scourge			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Scorpion Whip	TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Exotic.Slashing.Flail										COST:10461	WT:2		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4	EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Keen ~ Weapon			WIELD:Light		MODS:NO								SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																	
#SPROP:Once per day when the wielder confirms a critical hit he can summon a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as a swift action to swarm over the target (DC 20 Reflex negates). The swarm functions as an army ant swarm, as described in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary, but it fills only the target’s space and clings to the target, moving with it. It does not harm other creatures unless they enter the target’s space (including creatures grappling the target). The scarabs turn to dust even as they feast on the target’s flesh, causing the swarm to take 1d6 points of damage per round. If the target is reduced to negative hit points while the scarabs are clinging to him, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save each round at the beginning of its turn or be slain as death knell. The wielder of the scarab scourge gains the benefits of the death knell if the target is slain by this effect.
Scepter of Wadjet			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mace (Light)	TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Simple.Standard.Bludgeoning.Mace.Hammer							COST:5305	WT:4		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon			WIELD:Light		MODS:NO								SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=Deflection	BONUS:SAVE|ALL|1|TYPE=Resistance					
#SPROP:This scepter grants the wielder a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. When held in both hands, the bonuses to AC and saving throws provided by the scepter of Wadjet increase to +2.
Storm General's Lance		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lance		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.OneHanded.Martial.Reach.Standard.Piercing.Lance.Spear.Container	CONTAINS:10|Arrow			COST:32310	WT:10		CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:Material ~ Wood.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Shock ~ Weapon			WIELD:OneHanded	MODS:NO					REACHMULT:2		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																	
#SPROP:One Handed when mounted, Two Handed otherwise. Can be charged by loading an arrow, up to 10 charges. Loading an arrow is a move action, or a free action if the wielder has the Quick Draw feat. The wielder can expend charges in order to make ranged attacks, discharging a jolt of electricity as a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet. Each electrical jolt consumes one charge and deals 1d6+1 points of electricity damage on a hit. Ranged combat feats such as Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, and Rapid Shot apply when making these attacks. Each time a charge is expended, a slot opens to allow a new arrow to be inserted. Once per week the wielder can conjure forth a light chariot (as described in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat). This chariot remains for 8 hours, during which it is pulled by two phantom steeds and manned by a phantom driver.

#SPROP:The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on saving throws vs. poison, and once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause the armor to exude asp poison until the beginning of the wearer’s next turn. Any creature that strikes the wearer with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or melee touch attack or attempts a bull rush, grapple, or overrun maneuver against the wearer is exposed to asp poison. While the armor exudes poison, the wearer can extract one dose of asp poison and apply it to a weapon as a standard action, with no chance of poisoning himself. This poison lasts for 24 hours or until the weapon is used to make a successful attack.
Radiant Pharaoh's Mail	PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Scale Mail	TYPE:Armor.Medium.ArmorProfMedium.Suit.Standard			COST:67200	WT:30		ACCHECK:-4		EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Ability ~ +3 ~ Armor.Special Ability ~ Fortification / Moderate ~ Armor	MODIFY:EQ_MaxDex|SET|3		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	SPELLFAILURE:25		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|5|TYPE=Armor	BONUS:VAR|ArmorCheckPenalty|4	
#SPROP:The armor radiates continuous light, and once per day, the wearer can, as a swift action, cause the armor to shed bright light as daylight spell. If the wearer can use daylight or light as a spell or spell-like ability, he can quicken that ability up to three times per day, using it as a swift action. When the wearer is struck in melee, up to three times per day as an immediate action he can release a flash of radiance that affects his attacker as searing light, requiring a melee touch attack rather than a ranged touch attack. If the attack was a critical threat, this searing light hits automatically, even if the critical hit is not confirmed or is negated by the armor’s fortification property. If a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer, he can expend all three daily uses of this ability as an immediate action to create a sunburst centered on himself. This sunburst does not harm the wearer. After this sunburst is released, the armor’s light-based powers are suppressed for 24 hours, though it retains its enhancement bonus and fortification property.
Wretched Warrior's Garb	PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Leather	TYPE:Armor.Light.ArmorProfLight.Suit.Standard.Nonmetal	COST:5910	WT:15		ACCHECK:0		EQMOD:Material ~ Leather.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Armor		MODIFY:EQ_MaxDex|SET|6		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.8	SPELLFAILURE:10		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Armor	BONUS:VAR|ArmorCheckPenalty|0	
#SPROP:The wearer’s carrying capacity is three times normal, and she can endure hot climates as if using endure elements. The wearer also gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause him to become exhausted, fatigued, staggered, or to fall asleep, as well as on saving throws or Constitution checks made to withstand the effects of hunger, thirst, and dazzling or blindness from bright sunlight. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks made against subordinates in the same organization. In addition, the wearer can spend one hour infusing the effects of a potion into the patches and scraps of leather comprising the garment. The effect of the potion is stored indefinitely in that patch and can be activated by tearing off the patch as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Tearing the patch gives the armor the broken condition, and until it is repaired it cannot be used to store a new potion effect.

#SPROP:At sunrise, the wielder of may nominate one creature to be the shield’s charge. The selected creature gains the same shield bonus to AC as the wielder does, as long as the shield-wielder is within 5 feet, able to take actions, and not denied his Dexterity bonus to AC. While within 5 feet of his charge, the wielder can make a special shield bash attack twice per day as a standard action. In addition to the normal damage incurred by a shield bash, the attack pushes the target away from the wielder in a straight line up to 30 feet (DC 18 Fortitude negates). This distance is reduced by 5 feet for every size category of the target above Medium.
