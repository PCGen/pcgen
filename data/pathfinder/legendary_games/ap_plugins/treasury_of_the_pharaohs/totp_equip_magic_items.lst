###BLOCK: Rings
Necropolis Attendant's Band															TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:8000							SOURCEPAGE:p.11 	SPELLS:Magic Item|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=1|Detect Undead																																																																																						SPROP:Gifted to those tasked with the unenvious job of maintaining the myriad tombs of the dead, this silver ring is detailed with scripture of the goddess of rest and repose. The wearer can concentrate as a full-round action to detect undead. While the band is worn, unintelligent undead perceive the wearer as not being a threat (similar to how they would perceive other undead). As long as the wearer does not engage in any hostile acts, they will be ignored by the undead. An undead creature commanded to attack the wearer ignores this protection.
Signet of the Life Pharaoh																TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:45200							SOURCEPAGE:p.11		SPELLS:Magic Item|TIMES=3|CASTERLEVEL=1|Cure Light Wounds	SPELLS:Magic Item|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=5|Cure Serious Wounds		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Deflection		SPROP:This ring of protection +2 was formerly worn by a long-deceased noble called the Life Pharaoh. The pharaoh was slain in a bloody coup, but a sliver of his essence managed to cheat death and endure within the ring. The pharaoh’s intellect seeks to protect wearers with high scruples and strong character. The wearer can invoke the aid of the ring as a standard action, gaining the benefits of a cure light wounds three times per day, or a cure serious wounds once per day on command. When you use this ability to heal a good-aligned creature, that creature gains a +5 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round. Once per week, the spirit of the Life Pharaoh can fore- stall the death of the wearer. Anytime the wearer would be killed by hit point damage, the ring bestows a breath of life upon her. If this prevents the wearer’s death, her head is surrounded by a beatific halo for up to 1 hour, shedding light as a light spell and enabling her to gain a +10 sacred bonus on a single Wisdom or Charisma check or Wisdom- or Charisma-based skill check. Once this bonus is used, the halo disappears and the signet of the Life Pharaoh cannot use any of its healing abilities for one week.

###BLOCK: Rods
Chief Engineer's Rod		OUTPUTNAME:[NAME]	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Whip	TYPE:Magic.Rod.Weapon.Resizable.Melee.OneHanded.Exotic.Reach.Finesseable.Slashing.Flail		COST:37000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1		DAMAGE:1d3				WIELD:OneHanded					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.11					EQMOD:DISARM.LEATHER.NONLETHAL.TRIP									BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT|1|TYPE=Enhancement	BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (Engineering)|5|Type=Competence		BONUS:SKILL|Craft (Stonemasonry)|5|Type=Competence	SPELLS:Magic Item|TIMES=6|CASTERLEVEL=3|Ant Haul	SPROP:This stone rod is intricately carved with references of angles and weight tolerances. The chief engineer’s rod ends with a golden tip where several barbs emerge, allowing the rod to be wielded as a masterwork whip. Gifted to overseers in the process of constructing wonders, this rod grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus of Knowledge (engineering) and Craft (stonemasonry) checks. Once per day, the wielder can strike up to six targets with the whip portion of the rod, granting those struck the benefits of ant haul for the following 5 hours. Finally, the wielder can use the rod to move unattended objects by concentrating on them. This effect can move an object weighing no more than 1,000 pounds up to 20 feet per round.
Element Pharaoh's Crook		OUTPUTNAME:[NAME]	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Crook	TYPE:Magic.Rod.Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Exotic.Reach.TwoHanded.Standard.Bludgeoning		EQMOD:WOOD.TRIP.PLUS2W		REACHMULT:2		COST:60000	WT:3	BASEITEM:Rod		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:1						DAMAGE:1d6																				WIELD:TwoHanded		SPROP:Shaped in the form of a miniature crook staff, this rod shifts in color from white to brown to red to blue. The rod can be wielded as a +2 crook, and when striking an enemy the rod gains the corrosiveAPG, flaming, frost, or shock magic weapon properties (determine randomly for each success- ful attack). A creature with the ability to channel energy can medi- tate upon the element pharaoh’s crook for 1 hour to gain the use of the Elemental Channel feat for any one elemental subtype (air, earth, fire, or water) for the next 24 hours. If the wielder already possesses any one Elemental Channel feat, he can gains the use of all Elemental Channel feats for 24 hours. Similarly, a spellcasting creature can meditate for 1 hour to gain the use of the Elemental Spell metamagic feat for the next 24 hours when preparing or spontaneously casting spells. A wielder that already has any one Elemental Spell feat gains the benefits of all Elemental Spell feats for 24 hours. The element pharaoh’s crook must be wielded in order to cast an Elemental Spell or use an Elemental Channel of a type the wielder cannot normally use.

#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Equipment File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the races file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical listing
#of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
#
#
#
#####1st Example

#Dagger		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Dagger		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Finesseable.Ranged.Thrown.Simple.Standard.Piercing.Slashing.Dagger		COST:2	WT:1		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:2		DAMAGE:1d4		EQMOD:STEEL		WIELD:Light		RANGE:10	SIZE:M

#####
#
#####2nd Example

#Saddlebags		TYPE:Goods.Container.Mount.Resizable		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Any=UNLIM	COST:4	WT:8		SOURCEPAGE:Equipment

#####
#The Dagger is an Example of a weapon, while the Saddlebags is an item that is set up to be used as a container for other
#items. The first field is the item's name and is required.
#
#The PROFICIENCY tag is only used with weapons, armor and shields. It tells PCGen what Weapon Proficiency name to use from the weapprofs.lst, armorprofs.lst or shieldprofs.lst file.
#
#The TYPE tag is used for many filtering and PRExxx tags. TYPE:Armor items should also have the type of SLOTS it uses. This
#is usually TYPE:Suit. TYPE:Container is a special type name. It activates the CONTAINS tag in the item. Every TYPE:Weapon
#item must be also have either TYPE:Melee or TYPE:Ranged (TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Foo). TYPE:Double is a special weapon tag. It
#activates three ALTxxx tags for the second head statistics.
#
#The CONTAINS tag is used to define how much and what a container can hold. Any object with CONTAINS must also be TYPE:Container
#for the CONTAINS tag to be activated.
#
#The COST tag sets the cost of the item.
#
#The WT tag is holding the item's weight.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the item. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#CRITMULT, CRITRANGE, DAMAGE, WIELD, and RANGE are tags that are associated with weapons. They can be used to set up the
#various weapon stats.

#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Item. F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,
#C=Colossal.

#The EQMOD tag calls an equipment modifier to be applied to the base item before looking at other tags. You will need to use
#the equipment modifier's KEY with this tag, not it's name.
