Necropolis Attendant's Band	TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:8000	WT:0		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.11	SPELLS:Magic Item|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=1|Detect Undead																							
#SPROP:The wearer can concentrate as a full-round action to detect undead. While the band is worn, unintelligent undead perceive the wearer as not being a threat. As long as the wearer does not engage in any hostile acts, they will be ignored by the undead. An undead creature commanded to attack the wearer ignores this protection.
Signet of the Life Pharaoh	TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:45200	WT:0		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.11	SPELLS:Necropolis Attendant's Band|TIMES=3|CASTERLEVEL=1|Cure Light Wounds	SPELLS:Necropolis Attendant's Band|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=5|Cure Serious Wounds	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Deflection	
#SPROP:Ring of protection +2. The wearer can cast cure light wounds three times per day as a standard action, or a cure serious wounds once per day. When you use this ability to heal a good-aligned creature, that creature gains a +5 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round. Once per week, the spirit of the Life Pharaoh can forestall the death of the wearer. Anytime the wearer would be killed by hit point damage, the ring bestows a breath of life upon her. If this prevents the wearer’s death, her head is surrounded by a beatific halo for up to 1 hour, shedding light as a light spell and enabling her to gain a +10 sacred bonus on a single Wisdom or Charisma check or Wisdom- or Charisma-based skill check. Once this bonus is used, the halo disappears and the signet of the Life Pharaoh cannot use any of its healing abilities for one week.

#SPROP:The chief engineer’s rod can be wielded as a masterwork whip. This rod grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus of Knowledge (engineering) and Craft (stonemasonry) checks. Once per day, the wielder can grant up to 6 targets the benefits of ant haul for 5 hours. Finally, the wielder can use the rod to move unattended objects by concentrating on them. This effect can move an object weighing no more than 1,000 pounds up to 20 feet per round.

#SPROP:The rod can be wielded as a +2 crook, and when striking an enemy the rod gains the corrosive, flaming, frost, or shock magic weapon properties (determine randomly for each successful attack). A creature with the ability to channel energy can meditate upon the element pharaoh’s crook for 1 hour to gain the use of the Elemental Channel feat for any one elemental subtype (air, earth, fire, or water) for the next 24 hours. If the wielder already possesses any one Elemental Channel feat, he can gains the use of all Elemental Channel feats for 24 hours. Similarly, a spellcasting creature can meditate for 1 hour to gain the use of the Elemental Spell metamagic feat for the next 24 hours when preparing or spontaneously casting spells. A wielder that already has any one Elemental Spell feat gains the benefits of all Elemental Spell feats for 24 hours. The element pharaoh’s crook must be wielded in order to cast an Elemental Spell or use an Elemental Channel of a type the wielder cannot normally use.

#SPROP:When used as a focus for any mind-affecting enchantment spell, this staff increases the DC of that spell by 1. The staff can also be used to deliver its spells via touch, with the wielder making a touch attack against the target. When a spell is delivered as a touch attack, the recipient must roll their save twice and take the lowest result. The staff allows use of the following spells: charm monster (1 charge), dominate animal (1 charge), dominate person (2 charges), control undead (3 charges).

Alabaster Icons of Bast									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:24000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	
#SPROP:Alabaster icons of Bast come in a set of three hollow alabaster sculptures, each intended to contain different portions of a favored feline being mummified to accompany its master into the afterlife. These squat figurines are roughly cylindrical, with lids carved into the shape of cat’s heads. The spirit of these cat companions lingers on and can be called forth when these enchanted alabaster jars are nearby to one another. All three alabaster icons of Bast must be within 30 feet of one another to call upon their powers, though they can be activated by different creatures. Guardian Cat: Once per day, the largest statuette can call forth an invisible guardian spirit that functions as a mage’s faithful hound, though to creatures able to see invis- ible objects or creatures it takes the form of a large cat. Purring Cat: Once per day, the medium-sized cat can be commanded to emit a soothing purr that promotes restful sleep and concentration for all allies of the creature that activated it. This functions as nap stack, but in addition creatures that prepare spells can do so in only 10 minutes rather than one hour. Mewling Cat: Once per day, the smallest cat can be commanded to emit a warm and enchanting meow of such insufferable charm that one creature chosen by the creature activating the mewling cat chooses is affected as reckless infatuation (DC 15), compelling the target to remain close to the tiny canopic cat. Alternatively, it can be commanded to emit a piteous mewling wail that functions as miserable pityUM (DC 14), dissuading creatures from attacking the creature holding it. In addition to the individual powers of the alabaster icons of Bast, once per day they can be used together in a ritual requiring one round to complete, summoning three celestial, entropic, fiendish, or resolute leopards or cheetahs (all creatures must be of the same type), as if using summon monster V. The alignment template applied to the summoned cats must match the alignment of the creature performing the ritual. If one of the alabaster icons of Bast is destroyed, the pow- ers of the others cannot be used until it is repaired; however, even if one alabaster jar is reduced to 0 hit points the magic item itself is not considered destroyed as long as at least one jar remains intact.
Amulet of Abhorrent Life								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet				COST:25000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	
#SPROP:This amulet is shaped to resemble the head of a falcon and is rendered in reflective brass. Most often crafted by cultists of the minor god Seker (sometimes referred to as Sokar), the amulet of abhorrent life perverts the natural order by giving undead a fictitious semblance of life. Undead and other wearers that are normally damaged by positive energy and healed by negative energy are instead healed by positive energy and damaged by negative energy. Positive energy effects created by creatures with the 1st-level granted power or minor blessing of the Repose or Sun cleric domain or warpriest blessing ignore the effects of the amulet of abhorrent life. Undead wearing the amulet of abhorrent life also gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate a living creature. If worn by a living creature, the amulet imparts the wearer with an illusory look of flaking flesh and rotted meat, granting a +5 circumstance bonus of Intimidate checks.
Canopic Sentinel Jar									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:10000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	
#SPROP:These clay jars are inscribed with sigils of life and fertility and are colored in vibrant faience greens and blues. Each canopic sentinel jar can be bonded to a single creature in a ritual which takes 1 hour. During this ritual, one of the four canopic organs (lungs, intestines, stomach, and liver) is removed from the creature wishing to be bonded and placed inside the jar. During the ritual, the creature is sustained by the jar’s magic and suffers no ill effects from the organ’s removal. A creature can be bonded to up to four such jars, each jar containing one of the four organs. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a creature bonded to one or more jars, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. The chance is 20% for each jar the creature is bonded to. For each jar a creature is bonded to, they reduce the amount of healing received by spells and abilities by 2 (2 hit points for 1 jar, 4 hit points for 2 jars, etc) to a minimum of 1 hit point of healing as each missing organ disrupts the flow of magical healing. A canopic sentinel jar must remain within 200 feet of the creature it is bonded to. If it is moved beyond this range, the organ inside is immediately transported back into the bonded creature. If the jar is opened manually (a full-round action when in possession of it), the contained organ returns to the bonded creature. Smashing the jar (hardness 8, hp 20) also causes the interred organ to return. The jar can be placed in an extradimensional space, but doing so causes the organ to return to the bonded creature. The magical effect causing the organ to return to the previously bonded creature is quite disorienting, staggering them for 1d6 rounds.
Canopic Chest of Eternal Repose							TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Container	CONTAINS:*700	COST:80000	WT:20		SOURCEPAGE:p.14	
#SPROP:Covered with a funerary shroud of the modern death goddess, the canopic chest of eternal repose is sectioned into four segments, each of which can house a canopic jar. The chest can hold up to 700 pounds and has a volume limit of 100 cubic feet. The contents of the chest are preserved so that they resist the passage of time and do not decay. Recently deceased creature (or parts of creatures) placed within the chest gain the benefits of a gentle repose. The true power of the canopic chest of eternal repose is when it is filled with canopic jars containing the four vital organs—the intestine, liver, lung, and stomach. The chest prevents the owner of the entombed organs from being the target of any effect that would restore it to life or unlife, while spells such as miracle or wish only reveal that the subject’s soul is still partially tethered on the material plane. Divinations attempting to locate the creature’s remains or communicate with its spirit automatically fail, as do effects that would detect the magical aura of the chest or anything within it, though the chest itself can be discovered if the nature of the deceased’s entombment is discovered. The stone of the chest is infused with invisible spiritual energies as strong as a wall of force. If this wall of force is damaged, it regains 1 hit point per round; if reduced to 0 hit points, the wall of force is destroyed.
Carpet of Desert Fire									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:88000	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	
#SPROP:This woven mat of golden silk is 5 feet square and embroidered with patterns of flame in glittering orange and scarlet. Crafted by ancient elementalists with a fetish for fire, a carpet of desert fire also serves as a prayer mat for cultists of fiery elemental entities and other devotees of the flame. A carpet of desert fire contains 50 charges when created, and as it is used the fiery patterns embroidered in it become sooty and blackened. When its last charge is expended, it crumbles to ash. While sitting or kneeling on the carpet, the user gains fire resistance 20 and can converse with any creature with the fire subtype as though they shared a language, and if he uses a planar ally or planar binding spell to call a creature with the fire subtype the maximum Hit Dice of the creature(s) he calls is increased by 2. A spellcaster who prepares spells and worships a deity that grants the Fire domain (even if the character is not a cleric or does not have that domain) can prepare spells as fire spells while kneeling on the carpet of desert fire as if he had the Elemental Spell feat by expending one charge for each spell he prepares in this way. A carpet of desert fire can expend a charge to enhance the power of creatures of flame. This creates a 20-foot-radius emanation that affects creatures with the fire subtype as a desecrate spell affects undead, though it grants them a bonus on saves vs. cold rather than against positive energy. This emanation is stationary and ends immediately if the carpet of desert fire is destroyed or removed from the area. The user of a carpet of desert fire can also use it to observe or enter the Elemental Plane of Fire or make contact with its denizens. By meditating upon the carpet for one hour, the user can expend one charge to ask a question of a fire elemental power as if using contact other plane or can scry (DC 16) upon a creature on the Elemental Plane of Fire. If the user wishes to ask additional questions beyond the first or to continue scrying, he must expend one additional charge for each round after the first. The user can also expend one charge after meditating to send a message to (and receive a reply from) a creature on the Elemental Plane of Fire as if using sending. Finally, the user can expend five charges to create a gate into the Elemental Plane of Fire. This gate is only 5 feet across and cannot connect to a specific location on the Elemental Plane of Fire (though it can appear within 1d% miles of that point). Creatures can move freely into or out of the gate. Keeping this portal open expends two additional charges per round after the first.
Censer of the Aerial Emmisary								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:3800	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	
#SPROP:The Pharaoh Kingdom has long alliances with air elemental clans, and this gilded incense burner is used to call upon their aid to carry messages or tokens. Once per day if a stick of incense is burned in the censer, taking 1 full round, the user can send a message borne on the wind as a whispering wind spell. If the user burns 10 sticks of incense, taking 1 minute, she can instead summon a small air elemental to carry an item or message to a specific location or individual, similar to an animal messenger. This elemental is more intelligent than an animal, however, and can be given more complex instructions on the recipi- ent of its message, though it speaks and understands only Auran. While carrying its message, it does not fight unless attacked, and even then it prefers to flee if possible. If you give the elemental a gift, such as a strongly scented perfume or powder, worth at least 25 gp, you may instruct it to serve the creature to whom it delivers the message for up to 5 rounds, as if that creature had summoned it with summon monster III.
Faience Idol (Delta Crocodile)	OUTPUTNAME:Faience Idol, [NAME]	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:15500	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	
#SPROP:Made of a blue-green ceramic, these idols stand a foot tall on average and are sculpted in the image of wildlife commonly associated with the lands of ancient desert empires. Similar to figurines of wondrous power these precursor idols lack the ability to animate real life figures, but instead change into similarly sized construct versions of the imitated creature. When an idol is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise). The summoned creature retains the base statistics of the creature but counts as a construct, gaining all associated construct traits. The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a faience idol is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. This beautiful crocodile figurine’s back is covered in hieroglyphic script detailing the paths of several prominent waterways. When animated, the idol takes on the form of a buoyant faience crocodile with a sculpted seat on its back for a rider. The crocodile can act as a mount for a single medium sized creature, but can only be used in such a manner when the crocodile moves on water—the summoned creature refuses to transport riders while on land. While transformed, the crocodile gains DR 3/adamantine. The crocodile idol can be used once per week for 2 hours when summoned on land, or three times per week for 6 hours when summoned in water.
Faience Idol (Desert Frog)		OUTPUTNAME:Faience Idol, [NAME]	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:17000	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	
#SPROP:Made of a blue-green ceramic, these idols stand a foot tall on average and are sculpted in the image of wildlife commonly associated with the lands of ancient desert empires. Similar to figurines of wondrous power these precursor idols lack the ability to animate real life figures, but instead change into similarly sized construct versions of the imitated creature. When an idol is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise). The summoned creature retains the base statistics of the creature but counts as a construct, gaining all associated construct traits. The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a faience idol is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. On command, this idol transforms into a large toad with an affinity for the desert. This creature is treated as a glacier toad but replaces the cold subtype with fire and changes its immunities and vulnerabilities appropriately. The toad’s aura of bitter cold ability turns into an aura of heat that deals fire damage instead of cold. In addition, the frog gains DR 5/adamantine. The frog idol can be used every 3 days for no more than 8 continuous hours each day it is summoned.
Faience Idol (Grand Tortoise)		OUTPUTNAME:Faience Idol, [NAME]	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:30000	WT:10		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	
#SPROP:Made of a blue-green ceramic, these idols stand a foot tall on average and are sculpted in the image of wildlife commonly associated with the lands of ancient desert empires. Similar to figurines of wondrous power these precursor idols lack the ability to animate real life figures, but instead change into similarly sized construct versions of the imitated creature. When an idol is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise). The summoned creature retains the base statistics of the creature but counts as a construct, gaining all associated construct traits. The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a faience idol is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Weighing 10 pounds instead of the typical 5 pound idol weight, this imitation tortoise has a shell made of a lighter hued ceramic. When summoned, this idol balloons into an immense tortoise (see Bestiary 4) composed of the same faience material. The turtle gains DR 10/adamantine and when using its shell ability, it gains fast healing 5. While it understands its owner, the tortoise cannot speak and only has an 80% chance of following received orders that require it to move or attack. When it ignores an order, the tortoise retreats into its shell for 1d4 rounds. The tortoise idol can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.
Faience Idol (Raging Hippopotamus)	OUTPUTNAME:Faience Idol, [NAME]	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:24000	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	
#SPROP:Made of a blue-green ceramic, these idols stand a foot tall on average and are sculpted in the image of wildlife commonly associated with the lands of ancient desert empires. Similar to figurines of wondrous power these precursor idols lack the ability to animate real life figures, but instead change into similarly sized construct versions of the imitated creature. When an idol is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise). The summoned creature retains the base statistics of the creature but counts as a construct, gaining all associated construct traits. The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a faience idol is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Posed with a comically smiling face, this model hippopotamus is mid-stride. When summoned, the owner must designate one creature or object within 70 feet to be the immediate recipient of a charge attack from the hippo. The summoned hippo ignores all instructions from the owner and targets the item or target until it is destroyed, at which point it returns to its idol form. While summoned, the hippo gains DR 5/adamantine, but cannot communicate with or receive commands from its owner. The hippopotamus idol can be used once per week and lasts for 1 hour, or the more likely result of its target being slain.
Faience Idol (Soaring Hawk)		OUTPUTNAME:Faience Idol, [NAME]	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:10000	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	
#SPROP:Made of a blue-green ceramic, these idols stand a foot tall on average and are sculpted in the image of wildlife commonly associated with the lands of ancient desert empires. Similar to figurines of wondrous power these precursor idols lack the ability to animate real life figures, but instead change into similarly sized construct versions of the imitated creature. When an idol is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise). The summoned creature retains the base statistics of the creature but counts as a construct, gaining all associated construct traits. The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a faience idol is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. On command, this idol transforms into a hawk or a hawk with the giant simple template. When transformed, this idol gains DR 2/adamantine and communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing them of all it sees and hears. The hawk idol can be used once per day from sunrise to sunset, and cannot be used in areas where the sun is not visible.
Oasis Mirror										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:7000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	
#SPROP:This golden hand mirror is encircled in a frame of blue faience. When moved, the surface of the mirror seems to ripple like a glassy pool, though it becomes still once more when the mirror is stationary. With a command word, the wielder of the mirror can command it to pour forth up to 12 gallons of water per day, pouring forth at a rate of 1 gallon per round, while a second command word causes 2d4 plump figs or dates to appear in the mirror. The wielder can reach into the mirror and take these fruits, eating or sharing them as goodberries. In addition, once per day the wielder can speak a third command word and present the oasis mirror toward a Large or smaller creature within 10 feet. The target is drawn into an extradimensional pool of water within the mirror (DC 14 Will negates). The target can close its eyes or avert its gaze as if the oasis mirror were a gaze attack. A creature trapped within the mirror is treated as if trapped within an aqueous orb, though escaping from the mirror requires a successful Will save rather than a Reflex save. A creature is ejected from the mirror after a successful save or after 6 rounds, whichever comes first.
Map Cartouche										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:4000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	
#SPROP:This small golden plaque is inscribed with tiny symbols around its edges, but the center of the cartouche itself is blank. Invented by treasure hunters and tomb robbers, once per day it can be placed next to any map, including one drawn by its owner, to reveal something hidden in the area that is not shown on the map, such as a secret door, hidden room, trap, or secret compartment inside a table, cabinet, throne, altar, or similar structure or object. A map cartouche does not reveal creatures, but it can reveal hidden hazards, such as green slime or yellow mold. The map cartouche must be held next to the map for 1 full round to reveal the hidden feature. If multiple hidden features are present, the map cartouche reveals the nearest feature to its current location. Perception and Disable Device checks made with respect to the revealed hidden feature gain a +2 circumstance bonus, as do Armor Class and saving throws if the hidden feature makes an attack roll or forces a saving throw.
Papyrus of Supplication									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:3000	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	
#SPROP:A papyrus of supplication is a specially prepared scroll upon a spindle of rare wood, and is always illuminated on one side in elaborate hieroglyphics that call forth the blessings of one of the core deities revered within the Pharaoh Kingdom, whether a major deity like Lamashtu or a minor deity like Khepri or Wadjet. When unrolled, a character trained in Linguistics and Profession (scribe) can use rare inks and pigments (costing at least 100 gp) to inscribe a prayer or request to that deity. With successful DC 23 Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, the request inscribed on the papyrus of supplication is granted, subject to the restrictions below. If the writer does not worship the deity to whom the papyrus of supplication is consecrated, he takes a -5 penalty on skill checks to use it. A divine spellcaster that worships the same deity gains a +2 circumstance bonus on skill checks to use a papyrus of supplication. The request made upon the papyrus of supplication must be one that is in keeping the nature, alignment, and areas of interest of the deity in question. It can duplicate the effect of a cleric/oracle spell of 6th level or lower, any divine spell of 5th level or lower, or any arcane spell of 4th level or lower. It can undo the effects of harmful spells as a limited wish, and it can produce other effects whose power level is in line with the above, as a limited wish. The save DC of any spell created by a papyrus of supplication is as for a 7th-level spell. A papyrus of supplication can also create more mundane effects, such as protecting crops from storms or floods, warding off plagues and drought, ensuring (or preventing) healthy childbirth, or similar effects. These effects last up to one year and affect an area inversely proportional to the power of the effect. A papyrus of supplication that granted a +2 circumstance bonus on one Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or Profession check might affect an entire city, while one that spread a baneful curse might affect only one family, one business, one temple of a rival deity, or even a single creature. The precise limits on what you can accomplish are subject to GM discretion, but must be consonant with the nature, alignment, and areas of influence of the associate deity. Inscribing a papyrus of supplication takes 1 hour and must be done in an area consecrated, desecrated, hallowed, or unhallowed to its associated deity, or with the papyrus spread on a permanent altar or shrine to that deity. When the duration of the effect created by the papyrus of supplication ends, the papyrus crumbles to dust, powerless. For non-instantaneous effects, if the papyrus of supplication is destroyed prematurely, or if it is taken into an area that is not consecrated, desecrated, hallowed, or unhallowed to its associated deity, any effects it creates are likewise ended immediately.
Tomb Warden's Stele									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous					COST:5500	WT:30		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	
#SPROP:This two-foot wide carved slab has a square indentation with perfectly weathered sandstone. When first discovered, the face of the tomb warden’s stele is blank. Anyone who appropriately identifies the properties of the item can chisel on a message of no more than 25 words. The writer immediately becomes linked to the stele, gaining several benefits. A creature linked to the tomb warden’s stele hears a mental alarm (as per the alarm spell) any time someone comes within 100 feet of the stele. As a standard action, the linked creature can see from a vantage of 500 feet above the stele, rotating their viewpoint up to 360 degrees. The creature perceives with its normal visual senses. All of these abilities cease to function if the linked create travels more than 50 miles away from the stele. The stele remains linked to a creature until they die. If erase or make whole is cast upon the stele, the connection is also broken and the item can be re-linked by inscribing a new message on its surface.

###BLOCK: Artifacts (Minor)
# Equipment Name	Type				Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Funerary Pyramid	TYPE:Artifact.Minor	COST:0	WT:15		SOURCEPAGE:19	
#SPROP:This red clay is sometimes formed as a ziggurat or step pyramid and sometimes smooth-sided and clad in polished limestone and capped with gold. Whatever its form, it can be attuned to a specific site, typically a temple or crypt, and meditated over for 8 hours while funerary prayers are recited from the books of the dead. Once this ritual is completed, a creature with the power to channel negative energy can use the funerary pyramid to control undead (as per the spell) with the following limitations. In order to control undead, the user must be touching the funerary pyramid and the targeted undead must have been created within the attuned site. There is no limit to the number of undead the wielder can control while using this item, though each target is allowed a DC 23 Will save to resist a command. If the command involves a dangerous action or activity, undead that are not mindless can attempt a new save each round at the end of their turn to break free of the funerary pyramid’s control. An undead created within the attuned site never attacks the a creature touching the funerary pyramid, and this protection persists for 15 minutes after the creature releases the funerary pyramid, though this protection is ended if the creature attacks any undead. The wearer must issue any commands in a language spoken by the undead. In the case of mindless undead, this language can be one the creature understood while alive. A funerary pyramid is deeply invested with negative energy, radiating a permanent desecrate effect and being treated as a permanent shrine or altar. This desecrate effect cannot be countered or dispelled by consecrate without first casting dispel evil and making a successful DC 26 caster level check, which suppresses the desecrate effect for 1 round per level of the caster. A consecrate spell cast during this time suppresses the funerary pyramid’s desecrate effect for as long as the consecrate spell persists. The funerary pyramid absorbs area effects that use positive energy, negating such effects completely, as well as ranged positive energy effects that target creatures within 20 feet. It cannot absorb positive energy effects that are delivered by touch, unless those effects are used to touch it directly. The funerary pyramid can absorb up to 200 hit points of positive energy per day, and each effect that it absorbs adds to this total. Effects that affect multiple creatures or an area, such as mass cure light wounds or channel energy, apply the amount of their positive energy only once to the funerary pyramid, as though it were a single creature affected by it; positive energy from a single effect is not cumulative even if it absorbs that energy from multiple creatures. Once the cone has absorbed 200 hit points of positive energy, any positive energy above this total functions normally and its desecrate effect is weakened, as though it were no longer a permanent altar or shrine to evil until the next day, when its absorbed positive energy dissipates and its powers return.
