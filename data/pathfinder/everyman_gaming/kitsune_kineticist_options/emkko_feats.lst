Blazing Fox Form		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Burn																	PRELEVEL:MIN=3	PRERACE:1,Kitsune			DESC:You vanish from your enemies' sight in a bright flicker of shadow and spiritual power.	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	BENEFIT:Whenever an opponent within 30 feet of you makes a melee or ranged against you and misses, you can accept 1 point of burn as an immediate action to transform into a Tiny blurred shape resembling a fiery fox and move up to 50 feet. You count as having a 50 foot fly speed with perfect maneuverability for this movement, and if your movement doesn't end on solid ground you fall. If you possess the Swift Kitsune Shapechanger feat, you may also use this ability as a move action or as a free action when an opponent within 30 feet of you makes a melee or ranged attack against you and misses. [Special] This ability counts as a utility wild talent for the purpose of how it interacts with kineticist class features.
Exploding Fox Form	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blazing Fox Form	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Infusion Specialization,Wild Talent ~ Kinetic Blade	PRELEVEL:MIN=5	PRERACE:1,Kitsune			DESC:Your body explodes with elemental energy whenever you transform into a blazing fox.		SOURCEPAGE:p.4	BENEFIT:Whenever you use the Blazing Fox Form feat, you can attack one creature who was adjacent to you when you used this ability with your kinetic blast. This kinetic blast must be modified with the kinetic blade infusion. You can further modify your kinetic blast with additional infusions beyond kinetic blade at your discretion.
Kinetic Kyubi		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Burn,Kineticist ~ Wild Talents																PRERACE:1,Kitsune			DESC:You tap into elemental energies to unlock kyubi powers.						SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:You can tap into elemental energies to allow yourself to temporarily transform into a kyubi-a kitsune with multiple tails. For each kineticist element to which you have access, you treat certain spells as utility wild talents, which you can select as normal. You grow an additional tail for every wild talent from this list that you learn, up to a total of nine tails. &nl; These talents have a burn cost of 1 unless otherwise noted, and any nonpermanent, non-instantaneous effects end when your burn is removed. Talents with an asterisk (*) next to their name instead have a duration of permanent. Using this wild talent is considered psychic spellcasting (except for the purpose of prerequisites), and you must provide emotion and thought components. If you learn a utility wild talent that acts as a higher spell level version of another spell on this list, you immediately learn a new spell from this list whose prerequisites you meet in place of the lower-level version. For instance, if you know beast shape I and you later learn beast shape II, you can immediately learn quick change in place of beast shape I. This also applies to two spells of different levels that both act as higher spell level versions of the same spell, in which case the higher level spell acts as a higher spell level version of the lower spell level spell. For instance, persistent image (a 6th-level spell) acts as a higher spell level version of major image (a 3rd-level spell) for this purpose even though the former never references the latter.

Kinetic Felling		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Utility Wild Talent																			PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=2		DESC:Rather than kill your enemies, you leave them with something to remember you by.		SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:Whenever your kinetic blast would render one or more opponents dead, you can accept a number of points of burn as an immediate action to leave your opponent stable at a number of negative hit points equal to their Constitution score -1. You may then choose up to one utility wild talent that you know and affect all targets that would have otherwise been slain by your attack with the chosen utility wild talent. Doing so cost a number of points of burn equal to 1 + the utility wild talent's burn (minimum 1). Opponents receive a saving throw against these talents even if they wouldn't ordinarily be able to on account of being unconscious, and they take a penalty to their saving throw equal to -1 per 10 points of negative hit point damage dealt to them by the kinetic blast that triggered this ability that exceeded their Constitution score.
Kinetic Shapechanger	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Kineticist ~ Gather Power			PREMULT:1,[PRESPELLSCHOOLSUB:1,Polymorph=1],[PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Shapechanger]										DESC:You're skilled at drawing elemental power even while transformed into different creatures.	SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:You can aim your kinetic blasts, use the gather power class feature, and make use of all kineticist class features you possess while under the effects of a polymorph effect, even if the creature whose form you assume lacks hands or prehensile appendages with which to aim your blast or gather power.
