Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality																							DESC:A dragon paragon is proficient with its natural attacks only. A dragon paragon is not proficient in any kind of armor or shield. If the dragon paragon becomes proficient in light armor, he ignores the armor's arcane spell failure chance (if any).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Dragon Exemplar					KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Dragon Exemplar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Dragon Exemplar																		DESC:By virtue of their status as paragons, dragon paragons gain physical strength and size more rapidly than other dragons do. At 1st level, a dragon paragon gains a permanent +2 bonus to its Strength and Constitution. At 4th level and every 8 levels thereafter, a dragon paragon permanently increases in size by one size category, to a maximum of Huge at 20th level. A dragon paragon gains bonus to his Strength and Constitution as well as a penalty to his Dexterity based upon his size, as shown on Table: Dragon Paragon Size Modifiers. Additionally, a Large dragon paragon's maneuverability shifts to poor. A dragon paragon does not alter the modifiers shown on Table: Dragon Paragon Size Modifiers if he uses a temporary effect (such as enlarge person or divine might) to increase or reduce his size, though other modifiers to his ability scores from such effects apply normally.

Heritage						KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Heritage					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Heritage									DEFINE:Pool_Dragon_Paragon_Heritage|0							DESC:Every dragon is a wellspring of latent magical energy, and a dragon paragon develops these mystic powers faster than most. Despite its relatively young age, an experienced dragon paragon learns to call upon powers that he would normally develop as a much older wyrm. When choosing a heritage, a dragon paragon is restricted to the heritage that is associated with his race. For example, a green dragon must select the green heritage, a lunar dragon must select the lunar heritage, and so on. A dragon paragon gains heritage powers at 1st level, 3rd level, and every 6 levels thereafter. The heritage powers a dragon paragon gains are described in his race's heritage. For all spelllike heritage powers, treat the characters dragon paragon level as the caster level. At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a dragon paragon receives one bonus feat. This bonus feat must be a dragon feat or belong to the following list: Blind-Fight, Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Fly), Skill Focus (Knowledge [arcana]), Toughness, or Vital Strike. The dragon paragon must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a dragon paragon learns an additional spell derived from his heritage. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table: Dragon Paragon Spells Known. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.

Paragon Presence					KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Paragon Presence			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Paragon Presence					DEFINE:ParagonDragonFrightfulPresenceDC|0							DESC:At 3rd level, a dragon paragon can strike terror into the hearts of its enemies with its very presence as a standard action or as a free action as part of an attack or charge. Opponents within 30 feet who witness the action take a penalty based upon the dragon paragon's heritage for a number of rounds equal to his dragon paragon level. This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice than the dragon paragon's level. An opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the dragon paragon's level + his Charisma modifier). An opponent that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the dragon paragon's frightful presence for 24 hours. Multiple uses of a dragon paragon's presence don't stack. This ability is a mind-affecting aura.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BONUS:VAR|ParagonDragonFrightfulPresenceDC|10+(DragonParagonLVL/2)+CHA																										SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Natural Armor					KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Natural Armor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																					DESC:At 4th level, a dragon paragon gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level, 13th level, and 18th level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|AC_Natural_Armor|1+(DragonParagonLVL>=9)+(DragonParagonLVL>=13)+(DragonParagonLVL>=18)																					SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Spells						KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality																							DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a dragon paragon gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. Only sorcerer/wizard spells of 4th level and lower are considered to be part of the dragon paragon spell list. The dragon paragon can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a dragon paragon must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a dragon paragon spell is 10 + the spell's level + the dragon paragon's Charisma modifier. A dragon paragon cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of sorcerer/wizard spells of 5th level or higher. Like other spellcasters, a dragon paragon can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Dragon Paragon. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. A dragon paragon's selection of spells is extremely limited. A dragon paragon begins play knowing two 1st-level spells of his choice. A dragon paragon gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table: Dragon Paragon Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells that a dragon paragon knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his heritage. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a dragon paragon can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the dragon paragon loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A dragon paragon may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. A dragon paragon need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Blindsense						KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Blindsense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																					DESC:At 6th level, a dragon paragon gains blindsense with a range of 20 feet. Using non-visual senses the dragon paragon notices things he cannot see. He usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided that he has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the dragon paragon cannot see still has total concealment against him and the dragon paragon still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the dragon paragon's movement and he is still denied his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures he cannot see. At 12th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the range of this ability increases by 20 feet, to a maximum of 60 feet at 18th level.

Damage Reduction					KEY:Dragon Paragon ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Paragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Damage Reduction.Damage Reduction Magic	DEFINE:ParagonDragonDR|0	DEFINE:DragonParagonDamageReductionMagic|0	DESC:At 7th level, a dragon paragon gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the dragon paragon takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1 point. A dragon paragon's damage reduction is overcome by magic weapons. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.
