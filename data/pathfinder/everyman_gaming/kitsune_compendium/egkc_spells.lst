Baleful Fox Form					TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5																			SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One humanoid			DURATION:Permanent		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:You transform the subject into a fox, functioning as beast shape III. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature, such as an aquatic creature transformed in the water, the subject gains a +4 bonus on the save. If the spell succeeds, the subject also makes a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the special abilities of its new form in place of its own. It retains its class and level (or HD), any class features it possesses that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities (other than spellcasting), and its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores. Any polymorph effects on the target are automatically dispelled and the target cannot use polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form while baleful fox is active, as baleful polymorph. Kitsune are immune to this spell and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action. When you cast baleful fox form, you may choose to include a contingency, as the spell. This contingency may include a duration for baleful fox form other than permanent, a condition that, when fulfilled, dismisses the spell, or both. This effect is not considered a contingency for the purpose of determining how many contingency spells the target may use at once.
Baleful Theriocephaly				TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5																				SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:Permanent		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:This spell functions as theriocephic blessing, except as noted. If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature's Intelligence becomes 2. It still retains its class, Hit Dice, and level and any benefits deriving from its Hit Dice and level remain unchanged. The creature may still cast spells, though it must do so using its newly modified Intelligence score. Any polymorph effects on the target are automatically dispelled when a target fails to resist the effects of baleful theriocephaly, and as long as baleful theriocephaly remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form. A creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.
Theriocephic Blessing				TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3																				SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:You change the target's head into that of an animal of your choice. The creature gains low-light vision and any natural weapons that the chosen animal possesses that are located on its head, typically a bite attack or a gore attack if the animal has horns on its head. While transformed, any items equipped on the target's head meld into its body. Affected items that grant passive benefits continue to do so, though items that require activation become nonfunctional for the duration of the spell. Nonliving creatures, such as constructs and undead, and incorporeal or gaseous creature are immune to this spell.
