Earthkin (Standard Kitsune)							KEY:Kitsune Racial Subtype ~ Earthkin					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kitsune Racial Subtype.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:By far the most populous of kitsune, earthkin can be found living in virtually any region inhabited by humans. Outsiders are more likely to encounter earthkin than any other kitsune clan, and as a result earthkin attributes are considered standard and other clans deviations from their norm. Kitsune of all ilk refute such foolishness, but admittedly understand where the misconception arises from. Earthkin have become dominant among kitsune because of their versatility. Rather than adapting to one specific environment, earthkin are flexible enough to excel anywhere. Furthermore, earthkin are more likely to wander than members of other kitsune are and the image of the capricious, wandering kitsune almost exclusively applies to earthkin, though their wandering has significantly aided their clan's expansiveness. Earthkin vary heavily in appearance and can be encountered with all of the fur colors of other kitsune clans. Earthkin tend to be average in appearance compared to the other clans and have no remarkable features by comparison.																				TEMPLATE:Earthkin																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Firekin (Desert Kitsune)							KEY:Kitsune Racial Subtype ~ Firekin					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kitsune Racial Subtype.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:Firekin inhabit the sandy deserts of the world. According to their songs and stories, firekin once lived peacefully amidst the sands until human kingdoms encroached upon their lands, forcing them to fully integrate among humans to avoid battling them for resources. For this reason, firekin tend to be more vengeful than other kitsune when slighted and revel in the fear and superstition that humans have of them. Although not inherently evil, firekin have less respect for laws than other kitsune and often ignore legal processes, especially when enraged. Firekin are slightly shorter than kitsune of other clans and possess enlarged ears and puffy, fulvous fur. These adaptations help a firekin to deflect and release heat during the day and keep warm during the frigid night.																																																																	TEMPLATE:Firekin																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Voidkin (Aberrant Kitsune)							KEY:Kitsune Racial Subtype ~ Voidkin					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kitsune Racial Subtype.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:Voidkin possess a unique place among the different kitsune subraces, for voidkin are considered either blessed or cursed. A voidkin's traits are identical to any one of the other four types of kitsune detailed here except for one detail-the color of their fur. Voidkin possess either snowy white or shadowy fur, with white fur symbolizing divine blessings and black fur revealing a spiritual uncleanliness or a taint in the kitsune's bloodline. Although both types of voidkin are considered two halves of the same whole, white-furred voidkin enjoy popularity among their ilk while black-furred voidkin are pitied as if they had some terminal illness. However, black-furred voidkin enjoy much more freedom then white-furred voidkin, who are expected to follow strict religious tradition after being spirited away for training.																																																									TEMPLATE:Voidkin																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Waterkin (Arctic Kitsune)							KEY:Kitsune Racial Subtype ~ Waterkin					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kitsune Racial Subtype.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:Native to the frozen wastes, waterkin thrive in the most deadly climates known to mortals. Waterkin are often somber and serious towards outsiders, reserving their cheer and laughter only for close companions and allies. Waterkin spend comparatively more time in their true forms than other kitsune races as a result of their decreased interactions with foreigners. Despite their cold demeanor, waterkin kitsune are generally benign and have been known to save strangers from certain doom on many an occasion. Waterkin are said to have close ties with the scintillating lights that glow in the northern sky and are able to produce similar effects to confound their enemies. Waterkin appear thicker than kitsune of other clans because of their fur, which is pale gray during the cold months and dark brown during warmer seasons. During the winter, their fur is warm enough that waterkin are able to survive the night in all but the most extreme cold without equipment if needed to.																															TEMPLATE:Waterkin																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Windkin (Steppe Kitsune)							KEY:Kitsune Racial Subtype ~ Windkin					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kitsune Racial Subtype.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:Named for the scouring winds that sweep across their homes, windkin dwell in steppes and on mountains. Once nomadic, most windkin now dwell among humans, but stubborn windkin communities that cling to the old ways exist. Windkin are very relaxed compared to other kitsune and have a benign relationship with humans. They are less mischievous than other kitsune but are also much more reserved and slower to befriend others. They have strong ties to wildlife and are widely considered the most nature-conscious kitsune, but other kitsune consider them to be dreadfully plainspoken. Windkin are of average height and possess slightly larger ears then standard kitsune. Their fur is a medley of gray, brown, orange, and fulvous and most prefer to wear their hair long. Windkin often adorn themselves in ritualistic beads that they claim bolsters their connection to their community's ancestors, making them in-tune with nature and spirits alike.
