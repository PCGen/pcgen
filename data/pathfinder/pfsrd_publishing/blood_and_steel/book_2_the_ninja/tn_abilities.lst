Unarmed Strike								KEY:Augmented Ninja ~ Unarmed Strike						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																																																																														DESC:At 1st level, an augmented ninja gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. An augmented ninja's attacks may be with any part of their limbs, allowing them to attack with their hands full. They suffer no off-hand penalty for striking unarmed, and so may apply their full Strength bonus on damage rolls for unarmed strikes. An augmented ninja's attacks deal lethal damage by default, but they may choose to do nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on the attack roll when attacking unarmed or grappling. An augmented ninja's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. An augmented ninja deals unarmed damage as a monk of the same level.

At 6th level, a bakguai can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing the feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability. At 10th level, a bakguai can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time.

Kinetic Blast								KEY:Chao Renzhe ~ Kinetic Blast							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																												DESC:At 1st level, a chao renzhe gains a kinetic blast wild talent of their choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches their element. As a standard action, the chao renzhe can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. They must have at least one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if they don't have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus. The chao renzhe is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless of effects from form infusions; see Chao Renzhe Tricks), and they can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms). A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor.

Mystic ninja need not prepare their spells their spells in advance.

Shadow Twin									KEY:Ninja Archetype ~ Shadow Savant ~ Shadow Twin				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																												DESC:A shadow savant can channel elemental shadow to create a semi-real duplicate of herself. Starting at 3rd level, a shadow savant can channel her shadow twin for a number of rounds per day equal to 6 + her Charisma modifier. For each level beyond 3rd, she can channel for 2 additional rounds. A shadow savant can begin channelling as a free action. The total number of rounds of channelling per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours. When a shadow savant begins channelling, a shady duplicate seems to step out from behind her into any adjacent open space. This duplicate creature is partially real and formed from wisps of shadowstuff. It appears as a dark, somewhat indistinct replica of the shadow savant that summoned it, but it has only half of the shadow savant's character levels (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level). At all times, the shadow twin remains under the shadow savant's absolute mental command. The shadow twin is limited in how far it can go from the shadow savant that spawned it The maximum distance that a shadow twin can exist at is 10 feet per shadow savant level. If forced or commanded to go beyond that range, the channelling ends. When channelling ends, either by choice as a free action or from the shadow twin reaching 0 hit points, the shadow twin immediately vanishes and the shadow savant is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent channelling.
