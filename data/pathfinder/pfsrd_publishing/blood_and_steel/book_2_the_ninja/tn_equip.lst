Kusari		COST:40	DAMAGE:1d3	CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	WT:6	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Bludgeoning.Trip.Disarm.Reach.Exotic	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Kusari	QUALITY:ItemDesc|The kusari is a weighted length of chain with a heavy clasp on one end suitable for attaching a small weapon to. The kusari is treated as a melee weapon with 10-foot reach and can be used against foes anywhere within reach. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a kusari sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can attach or detach a light weapon to the kusari. Attaching a weapon changes its damage, critical, and damage type to that of the attached weapon. If both the kusari and attached weapon are magical, the enchantment with the higher CL suppresses the other for as long as the weapon remains attached. If only one or the other is enchanted, the enchantment affects both the weapon and kusari for as long as they remain attached. If you are not proficient with either the kusari or the attached weapon, you are not proficient with the kusari for as long as the weapon remains attached.	SOURCEPAGE:22
Combat Tabi		COST:200	WT:2	QUALITY:ItemDesc|The split-toe design of these supple, wellcrafted boots allows their wearer to keep their footing on difficult surfaces. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made to cross narrow surfaces or uneven ground.	SOURCEPAGE:22
Ki-Clouding Bomb	COST:80	WT:0.5	QUALITY:ItemDesc|Usually shaped like a small paper ball with a long fuse, these cherry-looking combustibles function as a smokestick with the added effect of inhibiting the use of ki abilities within the cloud. Any creature within the smoke who attempts to use an ability that requires the spending of ki to function must make a DC 13 Will save to use the ability. On a failed save, the ability does not function. The ki cost of the ability must be paid whether or not it functions.	SOURCEPAGE:22
Metsubushi		COST:20	QUALITY:ItemDesc|Made from a hollowed-out egg filled with assorted agitants, these can be used as part of a dirty trick combat maneuver to add +2 on the CMB roll. Regardless of outcome the metsubushi is consumed, and its use must be declared before the combat maneuver roll is made.	SOURCEPAGE:23
Star Hurler		COST:100	WT:1	QUALITY:ItemDesc|This mechanical bracer features a winding key and a flat, spring-loaded clasp that holds a shuriken. Inserting a shuriken and winding the bracer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Attacking with a shuriken launched from a star hurler confers a -2 penalty to hit, but increases the range increment of the shuriken by 10 feet.	SOURCEPAGE:23

# Magic
Hands of Concussive Hurling	TYPE:Magic.Gear.Slotless	COST:18000	WT:1	QUALITY:ItemDesc|These black gloves are fingerless except for the thumb and index finger. Three times per day, when the wearer uses the ki charge ninja trick, the wearer may make a full attack instead of a standard action and apply the benefits of the ki charge trick to all weapons thrown as part of the attack.	SOURCEPAGE:24
Juhakkei Scroll			TYPE:Magic.Gear.Slotless	COST:6000	WT:1	QUALITY:ItemDesc|This scroll contains within it the recorded secrets of a specific non-master ninja trick. When this scroll is in the possession of someone with a ki pool who is capable of using ninja tricks, they may use the contained trick as though they knew it. Using a trick contained in a scroll costs 1 ki point in addition to the ki cost of the contained trick.	SOURCEPAGE:24
Ki-Puncturing Gloves		TYPE:Magic.Gear.Slotless	COST:8000	WT:2	QUALITY:ItemDesc|Whenever the wearer of these supple-palmed, tough-fingered gloves uses the ki block ninja trick, the save DC is increased by 4.	SOURCEPAGE:24

Kusari.COPY=Kusarikami
Kusarikami.MOD	COST:26840	SPROP:Alignment neutral; Senses 60 ft., blindsense Intelligence 12; Wisdom 16; Charisma 14; Ego 12  Language Empathy (Common plus 1 other language)	QUALITY:ItemDesc|This +2 heartseeker kusari uses a style of dense chain link seen more often in jewelry than in weapons, and wear on its copper construction has given it a green-bronze colour. It rarely sits still, preferring instead to exhibit behavior similar to a snake when left unattended. It is possessed of a curious, puckish Intelligence, and though helpful by nature it is easily distracted. If dropped or left to its own devices, a kusarikami will typically animate and fight or explore, as the situation necessitates. While animated, it has the stats of an iron cobra while keeping its own mental ability scores. It does not gain the find target or poison abilities, and its bite attacks deal damage as a medium version of the kusari with any attached weapons it may have. Out of combat, a worn or carried kusarikami will volunteer as an extra hand if it happens to be in a good mood.	SOURCEPAGE:24

Spacious Sugegasa		TYPE:Magic.Gear.Slotless	COST:2500	WT:2	QUALITY:ItemDesc|This simple-looking conical hat has properties like that of a bag of holding. While worn, the underside of the hat functions as an extradimensional storage space that can hold up to 15 cubic feet of volume or 125 pounds in weight. Sleight of hand attempts to hide small objects in the hat gain a +4 bonus. Retrieving an object from the spacious sugegasa is as simple as clearly picturing the object, then automatically catching it as it falls from inside the hat in as subtle or as obvious as fashion as the user wishes. This counts as a move action. Furthermore, the hat adds a +2 circumstance bonus to Disguise checks when trying to avoid attention.	SOURCEPAGE:25
Starkeeper's Harness	TYPE:Magic.Gear.Bodywear.Body	COST:5000	WT:3	QUALITY:ItemDesc|This thin cloth wrap fits well under armor. Although solid objects can be felt inside it, it never rattles or jangles when the wearer is moving. The wearer can pull from the harness an unlimited supply of non-magical shuriken, though any shuriken produced by the harness disappear at the start of the wearer's next turn. Retrieving a shuriken is the same action as drawing a weapon (a move action normally, but a free action for someone with Quick Draw for instane). Casting a spell on the starkeeper's harness that enhances projectiles, such as magic weapon, enhances all shuriken drawn from the harness until the spell ends.	SOURCEPAGE:25
Vanishing Sheet		TYPE:Magic.Gear.Slotless	COST:500	WT:1	QUALITY:ItemDesc|Generally, found as a folded square of very sheer material, vanishing sheets provide an emergency option to help their users avoid notice. By holding the sheet up by the corners and letting it unfurl in front of the user as a standard action, the magic activates and causes the sheet to take on a rather accurate pattern of the surface behind the user. This confers a +20 bonus on Stealth checks while remaining motionless. It provides no benefit if the user does not have an adjacent wall-like surface to blend against. The magic of the sheet lasts until the user moves from their square or until the sheet is dropped. It then becomes a non-magical object with a pattern similar to the surface it was disguised as.
