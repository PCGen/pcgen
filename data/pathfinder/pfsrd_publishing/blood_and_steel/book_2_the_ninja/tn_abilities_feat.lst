#Ninja Style Feats
#Kaleidoscope Style  -	DESC:The defining aspect of this style is the almost constant exchanging of weapons. Most practitioners of this style carry a wide array of weapons on them, using continual switch-ups to keep their foes off balance and reeling.
Kaleidoscope Flurry	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:You have learned to use your arsenal to weaken and bypass the defenses of tough creatures.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Double Slice, Kaleidoscope Style, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +9	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Double Slice,Kaleidoscope Style,Improved Two-Weapon Fighting	PRETOTALAB:9	BENEFIT:When you bypass damage reduction due to weapon material or type of damage, the next attack you make on the same turn with a different weapon overcomes damage reduction as though it were made of the same material or dealt the same type of damage.
Kaleidoscope Storm	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:Your bewildering speed is almost impossible to keep up with, making your weapons appear to flutter about you of their own accord.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Kaleidoscope Flurry, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Feint, base attack bonus +12	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Kaleidoscope Flurry,Greater Two-Weapon Fighting,Two-Weapon Feint	PRETOTALAB:12	BENEFIT:When you confirm a critical hit while using kaleidoscope style, you may release your weapon as a free action to allow it to fight on its own for 4 rounds as though it possessed the dancing enchantment. Applying this effect to a new weapon immediately ends the effect on any other weapon.
Kaleidoscope Style	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:You can find your scabbard quickly, and know how to switch between weapons to deadly effect.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Quick Draw, Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +6	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Quick Draw,Greater Two-Weapon Fighting	PRETOTALAB:6	BENEFIT:Sheathing a weapon becomes a free action. Weapons drawn between attacks during a full attack gain a +1 bonus to hit on the first attack made with that weapon.
# Kigakuruujutsu Style	DESC:You have trained in an assassination art with a heavy focus on shock & awe tactics. Though critics decry it as "flipping out" and killing people, you know that the form contains the secrets to true ultimate power.
Kigakuruujutsu Decapitation	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:Your merciless strikes mutilate those you murder, striking fear into the hearts of those who still stand against you.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Acrobatics 8 ranks, Intimidate 8 ranks, Kigakuruujutsu Style, sneak attack +4d6	PRESKILL:2,Acrobatics=8,Intimidate=8	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Kigakuruujutsu Style	PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttack,4	BENEFIT:When you kill an opponent while using kigakuruujutsu style, as a swift action you may attempt to demoralize a number of opponents equal to half your character level using an acrobatics check in place of an intimidate check. All targets must be within 30 feet of you. If any of the targets are currently shaken as the result of a successful intimidate check that did not use acrobatics, they become frightened instead. Using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent who is shaken by this ability instead causes them to be frightened.
Kigakuruujutsu Massacre	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:You understand how to capitalize on the terror of your foes, their fear providing you with a larger opening than any armor gap.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Acrobatics 12 ranks, Intimidate 12 ranks, Kigakuruujutsu Decapitation, sneak attack +6d6,	PRESKILL:2,Acrobatics=12,Intimidate=12	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Kigakuruujutsu Decapitation	PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttack,6	BENEFIT:Frightened or panicked opponents taking actions other than total defense may be sneak attacked as though they had lost their dexterity bonus. This does not change their effective armor class.
Kigakuruujutsu Style	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:You have learned the art of the raging assassin.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Acrobatics 4 ranks, Intimidate 4 ranks, sneak attack +2d6,	PRESKILL:2,Acrobatics=4,Intimidate=4	PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttack,2	BENEFIT:While using this style, once per turn when you bring an adjacent opponent below 0 hit points, you may attempt to demoralize a visible opponent within 30 feet as a swift action, rolling an Acrobatics check and using the result in place of an intimidate check. Against shaken foes, you may use intimidate instead of acrobatics to move through the squares they threaten without provoking attacks of opportunity. When moving through threatened squares in this way, you move at full speed.
# Salikotai Style -	DESC:You have studied a fiendish form of martial arts, based off the assassins of hell. Through skill with the kusari, you have learned to imitate their lashing tails.
Salikotai	TYPE:Combat	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:You have learned the basics of the Salikotai style.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Dex 15+, Improved Unarmed Strike, Proficient with kusari, base attack bonus +5	PRESTAT:1,DEX=15	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike	PREWEAPONPROF:1,Kusari	BENEFIT:By wearing a kusari around your waist, you have learned to strike foes with it as though it were a tail. Securing or removing a worn kusari is a standard action. While wearing a kusari, you can treat it as a secondary natural attack. You can only wear one kusari at a time this way, and while a kusari is worn it loses reach and cannot be wielded as a normal weapon.
# Vanishing Style - This style weaponizes the old saying "the hand is quicker than the eye", by teaching its practitioners to strike where the opponent isn't looking and can't defend themselves. Advanced users of the style are able to mislead a foe into reacting to enemies that aren't there.
Vanishing Shadow	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:If your vanishing strikes don't outright kill, they hamper your foes, leaving them with blind spots.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Dex 19, Sleight of Hand 11 ranks, Vanishing Strike	PRESTAT:1,DEX=19	PRESKILL:1,Sleight of Hand=11	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vanishing Strike	BENEFIT:When an opponent takes damage from vanishing strike, they are treated as being threatened from the square the attack was delivered from for the purposes of flanking until the start of your next turn. In addition, as a move action you may immediately trigger all active vanishing strikes you have on a target, rather than waiting for them to activate on their own.
Vanishing Strike	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:By bruising muscles and jabbing tendons, you injure your foe in a way they may not notice until they put weight on the injury.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Dex 17+, Sleight of Hand 8 ranks, Vanishing Style	PRESTAT:1,DEX=17	PRESKILL:1,Sleight of Hand=8	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vanishing Style	BENEFIT:You have learned to place your blows to the point where your opponent doesn't realize they've been injured. When making an attack, you may make a Sleight of Hand check opposed by your opponent's Perception check. If you succeed, complete the attack as normal and apply the damage at the start of your next turn instead of immediately. For every 5 points by which you beat their Perception check, you may choose to delay the damage for one additional turn. Damage applied on the same turn counts as part of any case of the target taking massive damage in one round.
Vanishing Style	TYPE:Combat.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:FEAT	DESC:Your quick reactions and quicker hands let you circumvent and ruin the defenses of those who would stand before you.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite(s): Dex 15+, Sleight of Hand 5 ranks, Deft Hands	PRESTAT:1,DEX=15	PRESKILL:1,Sleight of Hand=5	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deft Hands	BENEFIT:Once per turn, you may choose one opponent you threaten as the target of this feat. Make a Sleight of Hand check opposed by their Perception check. If you succeed, calculate your attacks as though you were in an adjacent square from which you would still threaten the target.
