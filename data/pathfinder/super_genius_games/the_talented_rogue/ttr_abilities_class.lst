Proficiencies	KEY:Talented Rogue ~ Proficiencies		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedRogueClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:A rogue is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

Rogue Edges		KEY:Talented Rogue ~ Rogue Edges		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedRogueClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:TalentedRogueEdgeCount|0	DESC:Every rogue has a unique outlook on life, which colors what threats she takes seriously, what esoteric skills she studies, and what kinds of tricks and knacks she picks up. These abilities, known as edges, help a rogue act as an assassin, scout, expert treasure locator, or some combination or roles that appeal to her in particular. A rogue gains an edge at 1st level, and additional edges at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 8th level, and a final edge at 20th level. Edges are similar to rogue talents, but are more fundamental to her background and worldview, and require constant and regular practice to keep effective. As a result there's a limit to how many edges a rogue can have, and most edges must be selected early in the rogue's career. While a rogue gains multiple edges over her first few levels, those acquisitions represent the culmination of years (possibly a lifetime) of effort and study. A rogue may not decide to take the evasion edge until 4th level, but she has been thinking about how to escape explosions and practicing her ideas for long years before her acumen rises to the level of that edge. A rogue may not take an edge more than once unless it specifies otherwise. Some edges are taken from various rogue archetypes. These edges include the name of their originating archetype as a descriptor, to allow GMs to limit characters to edges from a single archetype (if desired).

Rogue Talents	KEY:Talented Rogue ~ Rogue Talents		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedRogueClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:TalentedRogueTalentCount|0	DESC:As a talented rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 1st, a talented rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every level of rogue attained after 1st. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once unless the talent specifies otherwise. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made, and a rogue must have selected the sneak attack talent at least once before selecting any talents that modify it. Some talents are taken from various rogue archetypes. These talents include the name of their originating archetype as a descriptor, to all GMs to limit characters to talents from a single archetype, if desired.

# Needs Uncanny Dodge
Improved Uncanny Dodge	KEY:Talented Rogue Edge ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.Edges.TalentedRogueEdge.SpecialQuality	PREVARGTEQ:RogueLVL,4	DESC:The rogue can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see below) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

Ki Pool			KEY:Talented Rogue Edge ~ Ki Pool				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassAbility.Edges.TalentedRogueEdge.SpecialQuality					DESC:[Ninja] The rogue gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the rogue's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her rogue level + her Int or Cha modifier (selected when this edge is taken). As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows). By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a rogue can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a rogue can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A rogue can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting some rogue talents with the rogue descriptor. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the rogue possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, her rogue levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The rogue can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.	SOURCEPAGE:p.4

(Obviously the individual already believes he is telling the truth, this allows him to convince others that what the rogue originally said is true.) If his Bluff skill modifier is better than the rogue's, the individual can use his own modifier and gain a +2 bonus on any check to convince others of the lie. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken).

Thus a 7th level rogue with the shank talent has a +6/+1 attack progressing if she only uses daggers to attack for one round. Because the attacks made with the shank talent are quick, forceful, and simple, it is not possible to add precision damage (such as sneak attack dice) to any attack made using this talent. This talent may be taken multiple times, but the rogue's effective base attack bonus with light melee weapons may never exceed her rogue level.																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Shadow Clone			KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Shadow Clone			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality						DESC:[Ninja] The rogue can create 1d4 shadowy duplicates of herself that conceal her true location. This ability functions as mirror image, using the rogue's level as her caster level. Using this ability is a standard action that uses up 1 ki point. A rogue must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Slow Metabolism			KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Slow Metabolism		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality					DESC:[Ninja] The rogue has a slower-than-normal metabolism. She can hold her breath for twice as long as normal before needing to make Constitution checks (four times her Constitution score). In addition, whenever the rogue is poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison's frequency) is doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of "1/round for 6 rounds" would instead be "1/2 rounds for 12 rounds."																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Slow Reactions*			KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Slow Reactions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality					DESC:Opponents damaged by the rogue's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. A rogue must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Smoke Bomb				KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Smoke Bomb			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality					DESC:[Ninja] This ability allows a rogue to throw a smoke bomb that creates a cloud of smoke with a 15-foot radius. This acts like the smoke from a smokestick. The rogue can center this smoke on herself, or throw the bomb as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. Using this ability is a standard action. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. A rogue must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Snap Shot				KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Snap Shot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality					DESC:A rogue with this talent may treat her intitiative roll as a 20 for a surprise round, regardless of her initiative, but she may only take an attack action with a ranged weapon. Her normal initiative roll is used in subsequent rounds. If two or more rogues possess this talent, their initiative determines the order in which they act, but they all go before any other creature. If a rogue is prevented from acting in the surprise round, this talent has no effect.																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Snatch Arrows			KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Snatch Arrows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality								DESC:[Ninja] A rogue who selects this talent gains the Snatch Arrows feat as a bonus feat.

SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Sneak Attack			KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Sneak Attack			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality					DESC:If a rogue with this talent catches an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The rogue's attack deals extra damage (called "precision damage") anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 this first time this talent is selected, and increases by 1d6 every additional time the talent is selected. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment. This talent may be taken more than once, adding 1d6 to the rogue's sneak attack each time it is selected. However, a rogue's total sneak attack can never exceed half her rogue level (rounding up).	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Sneak Stab				KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Sneak Stab			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality					DESC:[Knife Master] A rogue focuses her ability to deal sneak attack damage with daggers and similar weapons to such a degree that she can deal more sneak attack damage with those weapons at the expense of sneak attacks with other weapons. When she makes a sneak attack with a dagger, kerambit, kukri, punching daggers, starknife, or swordbreaker dagger, she uses d8s to roll sneak attack damage instead of d6s. For sneak attacks with all other weapons, she uses d4s instead of d6s. A rogue must have the sneak attack talent to select this talent.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Sniper's Eye			KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Sniper's Eye			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.SpecialQuality					DESC:A rogue with this talent can apply her sneak attack damage on ranged attacks targeting foes within 30 feet that benefit from concealment.

Provided she is wearing light armor, when fighting in an environment where such structures exist, the rogue incorporates them into her Acrobatics checks by grabbing hold of the structure and swinging toward her opponent, making either a charge or a bull rush maneuver. Once she completes her attack or maneuver, she can reposition herself. Immediately after making the charge or bull rush, she can move 5 feet as a free action, even if the charge ends her turn. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.17

So long as she has at least two surfaces no farther than 10 feet apart to bounce against, she can ricochet her body back from one to the next, descending great distances with a single check. The DC is 10 + 5 for every additional 10-foot increment descended beyond the initial 10 feet dropped. If she fails, she falls the full distance.

Once per day, when the rogue makes a successful assassinate attack, she can cause the target's body to crumble to dust. This prevents raise dead and resurrection (although true resurrection works as normal). The rogue must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against the assassinate, this ability is wasted with no effect.

Assassinate*		KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Assassinate			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.TalentedRogueAdvancedTalent.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Talented Rogue ~ Advanced Talents	DESC:[Ninja] A rogue with this talent can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the rogue must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the rogue makes a sneak attack against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the rogue as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken). If the save is successful, the target still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but it is immune to that rogue's assassinate ability for 1 day.

These can be separate poisons, in which case they both affect the target individually, or two doses of the same toxin, in which case the poisons' frequency is extended by 50%% and the save DC increases by +2.

Deadly Shuriken		KEY:Talented Rogue Talent ~ Deadly Shuriken		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedRogueTalent.TalentedRogueAdvancedTalent.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Talented Rogue ~ Advanced Talents	DESC:[Ninja] As a fullround action, a rogue with this advanced talent can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shuriken throw. When she does this, she throws a single shuriken at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the attack hits. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the rogue increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5.

Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.20
