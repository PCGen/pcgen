If your check also exceeds a DC of 10 + the target's base attack bonus + the target's Wisdom modifier (or 10 + the target's Sense Motive bonus, whichever is higher), your target is also denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against this attack.

SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:You can cast spells that deal electricity damage and allow a saving throw as jolt spells, which linger on the body of a target that fails its save. The save DC of the jolt spell is 1 lower than normal. The jolt effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the jolt spell (minimum 1). Targets affected suffer muscle spasms, causing a -4 penalty to all Dex-based ability and skill checks, and a -2 penalty to all ranged attack rolls. Targets with Improved Evasion or immunity to electricity damage are immune to this added effect.
Lasting Caster								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Magister																																																							PRETEXT:Spellcasting attribute 15			DESC:Increase your effective caster level for determining duration.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.64	BENEFIT:When determining the duration of your spells, you treat your caster level as if it were two higher.

SOURCEPAGE:p.65	BENEFIT:You can have a mount move both before and after you cast a spell, and cast a spell while your mount takes a run action, without needing to make a concentration check.

If you have limited spells known, you do not automatically know these spells, but you may learn three of them for only one spell slot towards your maximum spells known. Each time you kill a living creature with a CR of at least %1, you gain one death mark. You may spend a death mark to cast one of your known selected spells by spending a spell slot of the same level or higher. Each day when you regain uses of your spells, you lose any unused death marks.|TL-3
Plait Incantation								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Magister		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus		PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1																																																	DESC:Ready to use a spell to increase another caster's spell power.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.66	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can ready an action to plait one of your spells into that of another spellcaster. When the allied spellcaster casts a spell, you take your readied action to cast your spell in response. Rather than have its normal effect, your spell grants your allied spellcaster a +2 enhancement bonus to his caster level for the spell that triggered your readied action. The spell you use to plait with your ally's must be within 2 levels of the spell cast by your ally, and cannot be a 0-level spell.
Scorch Hex									CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																									PRESPELLDESCRIPTOR:3,Fire=0																			DESC:Reduce a fire spell's save DC to gain a secondary effect.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.67	BENEFIT:You can cast spells that deal fire damage and allow a saving throw as scorch spells, setting any target that fails its save on fire. The save DC of the scorch spell is 1 lower than normal. The fire burns until extinguished (as a standard action or by an ally making a DC 15+spell level Heal check). Burning targets take fire damage at the beginning of your turn every round depending on the level of the scorch spell (0-1st level: 1 point; 2nd-3rd level: 1d3 points; 4th-5th: 1d4 points; 6th+: 1d6 points). Targets with Improved Evasion and those immune to fire damage (or non-flammable) are immune to this added effect.
Secret Spell								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																															PRESKILL:2,Bluff=5,Spellcraft=5																												DESC:Cast a spell stealthily.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.68	BENEFIT:You may make a Spellcraft check to conceal the act of spellcasting from opponents observing you (+5 if the spell has no verbal component; -5 if the spell has a material component or focus). Your check is opposed each round of casting by the Perception check of each observer. Casting a spell secretly takes at least a full round action, even if the spell's normal casting time is less. If the spell has no listed visual or other sensory effects, any opponent who fails the opposed Perception check is unaware a spell has been cast; otherwise, observers become aware you have cast the spell once it takes effect, even if they failed their Perception check.
Sidewinder Hex								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																															PRESKILL:1,Bluff=3																														DESC:Cast a spell that fakes what target it's headed for.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.69	BENEFIT:You can cast spells that deal damage as sidewinder spells, which give false visual cues as to their end destination. Such spells must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, target one or more creatures (rather than an area), and either deal dice of damage or have a duration based on caster level. Casting the spell as a sidewinder hex takes a full-round action, and allows you to make a Bluff check opposed by the Sense Motive check of each target. Targets that fail the opposed check suffer a -2 penalty to their AC and saving throws against the sidewinder hex. However, the spell deals 1 point less damage per die (if it deals dice of damage) and has its duration halved (if it has a duration based on caster level).

SOURCEPAGE:p.70	BENEFIT:You may make a Bluff check when spellcasting to fool observers into thinking you are casting a different spell (-5 if the spell has a material component or focus). Your check is opposed each round of casting by the Spellcraft check of each observer. You select what spell those failing their Spellcraft check believe you are casting (if this is not a spell you can cast you take a -5 penalty to your Bluff check). The effects of your spell may reveal your deception once it has been fully cast, but not until after it is too late for a foe to counterspell.

SOURCEPAGE:p.70	BENEFIT:While casting a spell from a school of magic in which you have Spell Focus, you can cause a bewildering show of lights and sounds to accompany the spellcasting. Casting a spell in this way takes at least a full round, even if the casting time of the spell is normally less than this. Make a Spellcraft check to demoralize all foes within 30 ft. who can see your display (this works in the same way as the Intimidate skill).

Any time you fail a Bluff, Disguise, or Linguistics (Forgery) check, you lose one duplicity mark. You may spend a duplicity mark to cast one of your known selected spells by spending a spell slot of the same level or higher. Each day when you regain uses of your spells, you lose any unused duplicity marks.

SOURCEPAGE:p.57								BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can toss a small, non-weapon item at a target within 20 ft. while firmly shouting for them to catch it. You may make a Bluff check against the target's CMD. If your check succeeds, the target reflexively catches the item, dropping any held item to do so.

SOURCEPAGE:p.65								BENEFIT:When you successfully initiate a grapple, you muffle sounds made by your target until it breaks the grapple.

SOURCEPAGE:p.68								BENEFIT:You may make a Spellcraft check in place of a Perception check to notice spells, spell effects, magic items, and creatures of the aberration, construct, dragon, fey, outsider, and undead types. If you beat the required DC to notice something with Spellcraft by 5, you learn what category of thing you have sensed (including its type if it is a creature).
Subtle											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																										DESC:Your actions are difficult to notice.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.70								BENEFIT:When you make certain skill checks (Appraise and Escape Artist checks, Diplomacy checks to gather information, or Perception checks to notice fine details), subjects observing or interacting with you must make Sense Motive checks (opposed by whatever skill you are using) to realize you are doing anything other than engaging in casual conversation or observation.
Thieves' Cant										CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																							PRECSKILL:1,Bluff																																	DESC:Send and receive secret messages.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.71								BENEFIT:Your subtle cunning improves your use of the Bluff skill to pass secret messages. You may attempt to pass a secret message of no more than 15 words as a free action once per round (rather than a full-round action) and characters other than the intended recipient take a -5 penalty to Sense Motive checks to intercept your message. Any time you attempt to send a secret message to an ally who has the Thieves' Cant feat, there is no chance of the message being misunderstood.
Wall Runner											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Acrobatic Steps,Nimble Moves																		PRESTAT:1,WIS=13																							DESC:Run up along walls.																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.72								BENEFIT:As long as you are no more than lightly encumbered and suffering an armor check penalty of no more than -1, you can take part of one move action each round to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall, or wall to floor, costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity normally if you leave a threatened space.
