Greater Judgment / Banishment							KEY:Judgment ~ Banishment				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:InquisitorClassFeatures.InquisitorJudgmentNeither.SpecialAttack																																								PREVARGTEQ:InquisitorLVL,12															DEFINE:InqJudgeBanishmentLVL|0	DESC:This judgment creates an aura around the inquisitor at a range of 1 foot, which prevents bodily contact from summoned creatures with an alignment that is opposed to at least one element of her own alignment. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Additionally, as a standard action the inquisitor can make a single weapon attack against a summoned creature. On a successful hit, the target must make a Will save (DC %1) or be sent back to its home plane.
