Some psychic warriors focus more strongly on their martial talents, and they discover that the martial disciplines along the Path of War are capable of strong philosophical insights. These insights lead to additional warrior paths for the psychic warrior to travel, and they are known as pathwalkers.

The pathwalker may select any two disciplines from the following list: Broken Blade, Iron Tortoise, Primal Fury, Scarlet Throne, Solar Wind, and Thrashing Dragon. These two disciplines will determine which warrior paths he may select as he makes his journey to martial perfection, selecting one to be his primary path and the second discipline path as his secondary at the appropriate level. He also gains the skill associated to that discipline as a class skill. Once he knows a maneuver, he must ready it before he can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by a pathwalker is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. His maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and he does not provoke attacks of opportunity when he initiates one. He learns additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown above. The pathwalker must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered psychic warrior level after that, he can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one he already knows. In effect, the pathwalker loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. The pathwalker need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. He can choose a new maneuver of any level he likes, as long as he observes his restriction on the highest-level maneuvers he knows. The pathwalker can swap only a single maneuver at any given level. A pathwalker's primary initiator attribute is Wisdom, and each pathwalker level is counted as a full initiator level.|PathwalkerManeuversKnown																																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Pathwalker Discipline|2						BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|3	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,2	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,3	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,5	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,7	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,9	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,11	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,13	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,15	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,17	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,19	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnownOne|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,1	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnownTwo|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,2	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnownThree|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,3	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnownFour|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,4	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnownFive|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,5	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversKnownSix|PathwalkerManeuversKnown|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,6																									SOURCEPAGE:p.132

He readies his maneuvers by meditating or performing weapon drills for 10 minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to repeat this again and change them. Pathwalkers do not need to sleep or be well rested to ready their maneuvers; any time he spends 10 minutes in meditation, he can change his readied maneuvers. He may not ready any individual maneuver more than once. He begins an encounter with all readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he may have already used them since he chose them. When the pathwalker initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered, see below). Pathwalkers may recover their maneuvers in one of two ways. The pathwalker may concentrate on nature of his martial path as a swift action as part of an attac or full attack to recover 1 expended maneuver. Alternately, he may flood his psychic being with martial knowledge by expending his psionic focus to recover a number of expended maneuvers equal to his Wisdom modifier (min of 2) [%3 maneuvers] as a full round action. As part of this recovery action using this method, the pathwalker may manifest a singly psychic warrior power known with a range of personal at his full manifester level without expending power points.  The character cannot manifest powers with a manifesting time greater than 1 standard action or a duration of instantaneous this way.|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|PathwalkerStandardActionRecover|PathwalkerFullRoundActionRecover																																																																																																																																																																																																																											BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|3	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,4	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,10	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,15	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:PsychicWarriorLVL,20	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadiedOne|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,1	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadiedTwo|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,2	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadiedThree|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,3	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadiedFour|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,4	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadiedFive|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,5	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerManeuversReadiedSix|PathwalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:PathwalkerHighestManeuverLevel,6	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerStandardActionRecover|1	BONUS:VAR|PathwalkerFullRoundActionRecover|max(2,WIS)																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.132

He can choose a new maneuver of any level he likes, as long as he observes his restriction on the highest-level maneuvers he knows. The war soul can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.

He readies his maneuvers by meditating over his mind blade for 10 minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to repeat this again and change them. War souls do not need to sleep or be well rested to ready their maneuvers; any time he spends 10 minutes in meditation, he can change his readied maneuvers. He may not ready any individual maneuver more than once. He begins an encounter with all readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he may have already used them since he chose them. When the war soul initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered, see below). War souls may recover their maneuvers in one of two ways. The war soul may concentrate on his mind blade to recover %1 expended maneuver from its psychic projection as a standard action and recover %1 maneuver. Alternately, he may flood his psychic being with martial knowledge by expending his psionic focus to recover a number of expended maneuvers equal to his Wisdom modifier (min of 2) [%3 maneuvers] as a full round action. While recovering maneuvers, the war soul's mental state makes him react violently to those who would attack him.  When attacked, he may make an immediate counter-attack against his attacker at his full base attack bonus; he may only make one counter-attack against a given enemy per round, and he may make no more counter-attacks then his 1 + his Wisdom modifier per round.

This bonus damage is precision based, and creatures not subject to critical hits are immune to this additional damage.|AwakeneBladeStanceInnerEyeBonus|AwakenedBladeStanceInnerEyeDamageDice																																								BONUS:VAR|AwakenedBladeStanceInnerEyeBonus|max(1,floor(MaximumInitiatorLVL/3))	BONUS:VAR|AwakenedBladeStanceInnerEyeDamageDice|1+(AwakenedBladeLVL>=7)																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.138

Precognitive Defenses			KEY:Awakened Blade ~ Precognitive Defenses		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AwakenedBladeClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:The mind's eye within the awakened blade's defensive senses is capable of reacting to multiple dangerous scenarios at the same time. The character may expend his psionic focus as a free action to initiate a readied counter, even if he has already used his immediate or swift action this round. This specifically allows for the use of a free action on another creature's turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.139
Hypercognitive Focus			KEY:Awakened Blade ~ Hypercognitive Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AwakenedBladeClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:An awakened blade's mind is able to anticipate his needs and subconsciously works to further his effectiveness. Whenever the character recovers one or more maneuvers, he may regain psionic focus as a free action as part of his maneuver recovery. He may only do this one time in a given round. Alternately, the character may expend his psionic focus when manifesting a psionic power and recover an expended maneuver.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.139
Clairsentient Counter			KEY:Awakened Blade ~ Clairsentient Counter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AwakenedBladeClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:By anticipating the attack before the attacker ever considers making it, the awakened blade using this martial technique may act faster than his opponent can even think. To use this ability, the character expends a readied maneuver and his psionic focus as an immediate action; the clairsentient counter is used in response to attack against him of any sort (be it a melee or ranged attack, spell, power, or other spell-like or supernatural effect) and grants the character a standard or move action that he must use as part of this counter. This movement occurs before the attack is resolved but after the attack is made.																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.139
Pretercognitive Mind			KEY:Awakened Blade ~ Pretercognitive Mind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AwakenedBladeClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																		DESC:The awakened blade's reactive capabilities are so intense that his subconscious mind must manage them for him as they otherwise would never give him a moment's rest. While psionically focused, the character is considered to have the benefits of the Stance of the Inner Eye without needing to initiate the stance. He may continue to gain these benefits while he adopts any other martial stance that he knows and gain the benefits of both stances.
