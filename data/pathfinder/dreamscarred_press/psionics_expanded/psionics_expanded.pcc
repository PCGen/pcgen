With new classes, new options for existing classes, new psionic powers, feats, items, and prestige classes, this book has something for new psionic characters and old! Contained within the pages of Psionics Expanded you will find: Alternate racial options for all of the psionic and core races; Six new 20-level psionic base classes: the aegis, cryptic, dread, marksman, tactician, and vitalist (a psionic healer); Advanced class options including class archetypes, advanced disciplines, and new psychic warrior paths, wilder surges, and soulknife blade skills; Dozens of new psionic and metapsionic feats; New psionic powers for all manifesters; Nine new psionic prestige classes, including the body snatcher, metaforge, and soul archer; New psionic armor, weapons, and items, as well as a new type of psionic item to empower mind blades, armor, and shields. Building off the core psionic rules of Psionics Unleashed, Psionics Expanded gives over two hundred pages of new character options to allow you to have exactly the psionic character you want. Psionics Expanded requires Psionics Unleashed.

# COMMENT: This data set references four feats and five abilities that aren't in core Pathfinder.
# COMMENT:   Most of these can be handled with INCLUDE tags.

# COMMENT: The special abilities "Adopted ~ Trait" and "Confounding Blades ~ Advanced Rogue Talent"
# COMMENT:    cause more error messages than they eliminate if INCLUDEd.

# COMMENT: There will be duplicate entry messages if APG and UC are loaded,
# COMMENT:    assuming those haven't been turned off.

# COMMENT: The below line removes one error messge, but not both that are generated;
# COMMENT:    likely because the ability is used in an ABILITYCATEGORY.
# COMMENT: FORWARDREFing Adopted ~ Trait still gives an error, since it's .MODded.
#FORWARDREF:ABILITY=Special Ability|Confounding Blades ~ Advanced Rogue Talent

# COMMENT: The below line causes PCGen to fail loading the data set.  Not sure why.
#FORWARDREF:ABILITY=Soulknife Advanced Talent|Confounding Blades ~ Advanced Rogue Talent

# COMMENT: Load just parts of APG that I want.
