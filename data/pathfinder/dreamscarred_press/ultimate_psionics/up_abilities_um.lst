Bound Vermin		KEY:Vermin Rider ~ Bound Vermin		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																										DESC:You and your mount are under the permanent effects of mindlink.

Eternal Bond		KEY:Vermin Rider ~ Eternal Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																										DESC:Your life becomes linked to your mount's. As long as the mount is alive, you are protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce you to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to the mount. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the mount is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with you. Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, or imprisonment, or other effect that do not cause actual damage.
