BONUS:VAR|BlindingFlashDC|10+(TL/2)+DEX	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:As a move action, you can expertly angle the blade of your weapon or shield to reflect light into an opponent's eyes, dazzling your foe for 1 round. This feat functions as a gaze attack, and the target must make a Fortitude save (DC %1) to resist the effect. This is a sight-dependent effect, and does not work on creatures that are already blinded or creatures that do not rely on sight as their primary sense. You must be wielding a weapon or shield with a polished or reflective surface in order to use this feat. You must be in an area of bright light to use this feat.|BlindingFlashDC

BONUS:VAR|SleeperHoldDC|10+(TL/2)+STR	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You must declare that you are using this feat before you make a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple (thus a failed check to maintain the grapple ruins the attempt).

The victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or else it falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds. Each successive round you attempt this, the target takes a cumulative -1 penalty on its saving throw.
