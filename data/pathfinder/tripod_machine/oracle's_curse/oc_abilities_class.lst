You had no choice in the matter; the brand appeared with fire and searing pain. Your brand cannot be disguised or altered, even with magic, although you can still benefit from cover or concealment, and you can cover it by wearing a hood or robe (as appropriate). Some NPCs may recognize the brand and become hostile, per the GM’s choice. As a supernatural ability, you can touch an enemy for 1d6+%1 fire damage; any opponent who takes damage bears your symbol until an equal amount of damage is healed.

You relate better to beasts than to “people.” You suffer a -4 penalty on Diplomacy checks. For purposes of spells, weapon qualities, and other effects, you can be counted as animal or your actual type (though spells that grant intelligence to an animal, such as awaken, do not work on you), whichever is least advantageous for you.

Divine powers have wracked your bones and nerves, filling you with power and insight but diminishing your mobility. Your movement rate is 5 feet, and your Strength and Dexterity are effectively no higher than your curse level for the purposes of skill checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. However, you can cast mage hand and open/close as orisons, in addition to your usual spells, and you may treat your Dexterity modifier to initiative as though it were equal to your Charisma modifier.
