#Biosetting files cannot have SOURCE tags in them so if you want to keep them in you must comment them out.

#insert your data here

#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Bio Settings tags" to find
#out how the tags in the biosettings file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#Bio Settings set the parameters for height, weight, eye color and other traits which can be randomly choosen in the description
#tab.
#
#The AGESET tag defines the age ranges for each race and age category. Each age category should have it's own AGESET tag
#with a different Text field for a name. Each AGESET tag should be sequentially numbered starting at 0, for the youngest
#age category.
#
#The RACENAME tag Defines the name of the race. Will appear under every AGESET tag. If the name is followed by a "%" symbol
#then that BIOSET will apply to all subsets of that race name. For example RACENAME:Elf% will apply to Elf (Drow), Elf (Wood)
#and all other Elf races.
#
#The CLASS / BASEAGEADD combination is used in AGESET:0 to define the number of years to add to the base age, for each character
#class of this race.
#
#The SEX / BASEHT / HTDIEROLL / BASEWT / WTDIEROLL / TOTALWT combination determines how the Description tab randomizer generates
#height and weight for the different genders.
#
#The BASEAGE, MAXAGE and AGEDIEROLL tags are used to set the limits for character age within the ageset for the given race.
#
#The HAIR, EYES, and SKINTONE tags are used by the Description tabs randomizing function.
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
