#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.

#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Equipment Modification File tags"
#to find out how the tags in the races file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#The first field in the equipmods.lst files must be the name of the modifier, after that, the tags do not need to be in any
#special order. In the Example the equipmod is named "Masterwork".
#
#The KEY tag is a unique descriptor for the modifier. It allows several modifiers to have the same name, which is useful
#if several are needed for different equipment types. KEY's must be universally unique. Make sure you don't use anything
#that's is used in any other source you load.
#
#The TYPE tag is different in equipmods than in the other files. It does not give the equipment modifier a TYPE that is used
#for selection, but holds a list of the TYPE's of equipment that the modifier can be applied to.
#
#The COST tag is normally used to hold a number or formula that is added to the item cost. In the Example this is 0, so
#nothing will be added there. This is because the Masterwork equipmod in the example is used for Ammunition and Weapons, which
#will result in different amounts to be added. The cost is instead handled in BONUS:ITEMCOST tags later in the line.
#
#The VISIBLE:QUALIFY tag is used, so this Equipment Modifier will only show up in the Item Customizer, when it is eligible
#for selection.
#
#The ITYPE tag can be used to grant further TYPEs to the item the equipment modifier gets applied to.
#
#The NAMEOPT tag is used to determine a naming convention.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the equipment modifier. This will be displayed
#in PCGen.
#
#The PRETYPE tags are used to make the equipment modifier eligible only if the item has the TYPEs Weapon or Ammunition, but
#does not have the TYPEs Masterwork, Mithral, Adamantine, or Darkwood. There is a multitude of existing prerequiste tags in
#PCGen. If you are looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic
#"PRExxx tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The ASSIGNTOALL tag is for double weapons only. If this tag is present then the modifiers will be applied to both heads.
