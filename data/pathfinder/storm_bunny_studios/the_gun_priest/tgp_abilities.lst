Aura						KEY:Gun Priest ~ Aura					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:A gun priest of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Spells Like a cleric, a gun priest casts divine spells, which he draws from the cleric spell list. His alignment, however, may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his beliefs; see the descriptions for chaotic, evil, good, and lawful spells. Like a cleric, a gun priest must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a gun priest must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against the gun priest's spell is 10 + the spell level + the gun priest's Wisdom modifier. Like other spellcasters, a gun priest can only cast a certain number of spells of each level per day. His daily allotment of spells is given on Table: Gun Priest Spells. Additionally, a gun priest will receive bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. Like a cleric, a gun priest must meditate and prepare his spells daily. Unlike a cleric, however, a gun priest performs a daily ritual, in which his vested gun is the main focus, when contemplating his divine path. He must have his vested gun when he prepares his spells. A gun priest that does not have his vested gun may not prepare spells.

Bonus Feats					KEY:Gun Priest ~ Bonus Feats				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 5th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a gun priest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The gun priest must still meet the prerequisites for these feats.

Channel Energy				KEY:Gun Priest ~ Channel Energy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Similar to a cleric, a gun priest can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted. A good gun priest (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil gun priest (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral gun priest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether he channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the gun priest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every four gun priest levels beyond 3rd (2d6 at 7th, 3d6 at 11th, 4d6 at 15th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to [%1] 10 + ï¿½ the gun priest's level + the gun priest's Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total-all excess healing is lost. A gun priest may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A gun priest can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect. A gun priest must be able to present his holy symbol to use this ability.																																																																																																																																						BONUS:VAR|ChannelEnergyDC|10+(GunPriestLVL/2)+CHA																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Domains					KEY:Gun Priest ~ Domains				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Similar to a cleric, a gun priest gains access to the domains associated with his god or philosophy. Unlike the cleric, however, the gun priest may only select a single domain from which to receive bonus spells and domain powers. Once this domain is chosen, it may not be changed. The restriction on alignment domains still applies to the gun priest.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Grit						KEY:Gun Priest ~ Grit					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Starting at 4th level, a gun priest gains grit, just like a gunslinger. At the start of each day, a gun priest gains a number of grit points equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Although these grit points will fluctuate throughout the day, the gun priest may never have more grit points than his Wisdom modifier allows. The gun priest may use these grit points to accomplish any number of deeds. A gun priest may only use his grit to perform deeds while wielding his vested gun. Like a gunslinger, a gun priest regains grit in the following ways:	DESC:&nl; Critical Hit with his Vested Gun: Each time a gun priest confirms a critical hit with his vested gun, he regains 1 point of grit. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless, unaware, or weak creature (one who has Hit Dice equal to or less than half of the gun priest's character level) does not restore grit. Likewise, confirming a critical hit with any weapon besides his vested gun does not restore grit.	DESC:&nl; Killing Blow with his Vested Gun: When a gun priest reduces an enemy to less than 0 hit points while using his vested gun, he regains a single point of grit. Reducing a helpless, unaware, or weak creature (one who has Hit Dice equal to or less than half of the gun priest's character level) to less than 0 hit points does not restore grit. Likewise, destroying unattended objects does not restore any grit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Deeds						KEY:Gun Priest ~ Deeds					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:DeedsLVL|0		DESC:Gun priests, just like gunslingers, spend grit to execute the various deeds they learn. The gun priest gains access to additional deeds, as he levels, just likes a gunslinger. A gun priest may only perform deeds that are his level or lower.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																BONUS:VAR|DeedsLVL|GunPriestLVL																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Gun Master's Wrath			KEY:Gun Priest ~ Gun Master's Wrath			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 20th level, the gun priest becomes a living extension of his god's wrath. Once per day, as a standard action, the gun priest may activate this ability to gain the following benefits: The gun priest is hasted, blurred, gains DR 10/-, and automatically confirms all critical threats with his gun. This ability lasts 1 minute.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Gunsmith					KEY:Gun Priest ~ Gunsmith				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 1st level, the gun priest receives either a Vested Pistol or Vested Rifle. Additionally, the gun priest gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Gunsmithing																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.5
Nimble					KEY:Gun Priest ~ Nimble					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:NimbleBonus|0	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a gun priest gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gun priest to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gun priest to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level).

Orisons					KEY:Gun Priest ~ Orisons				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Gun priest can prepare four orisons, or 0-level spells, each day. These spells are cast like any other spell, but are not considered expended when cast and may be used again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.5
Sacred Gun					KEY:Gun Priest ~ Sacred Gun				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:VestedGunBonus|0	DESC:The gun priest's faith is focused through the barrel of his gun. At 4th level the gun priest gains the ability to imbue his gun with divine power as a swift action. When he does so, his weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. For every four levels beyond 4th level, this bonus increases by +1 to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. The gun priest may, at higher levels, imbue his gun with magical properties. Adding any of these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the properties base cost and the gun priest may not add or duplicate properties. Additionally, the gun priest may not add properties to his gun that are opposed to his alignment (a good gun priest cannot add the unholy property, for instance). The gun must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other properties can be added, whether that enhancement is gained through the use of this ability or is inherent. Once the gun priest reaches 8th level, he adds the following to the list of properties that he can imbue his weapon with: bane, corrosive, cruel, flaming, frost, ghost touch, reliable, shock, and thundering. Once the gun priest reaches 12th level, he adds the following to the list of properties that he can imbue his weapon with: anarchic, axiomatic, designating (lesser), disruptive, holy, negating, and unholy. Once the gun priest reaches 16th level, he adds the following to the list of properties that he can imbue his weapon with: corrosive burst, distance, flaming burst, icy burst, igniting, keen, seeking, and shocking burst. Once the gun priest reaches 20th level, he adds the following to the list of properties that he can imbue his weapon with: brilliant energy, designating (greater), nimble shot, reliable (greater), speed, and stalking. The gun priest can only use this ability one round per day per gun priest level, but these rounds need not be consecutive. The enhancement bonus and properties are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the ability is used on the following day. Furthermore, these bonuses only apply while the gun priest is holding his gun. They immediately end if the gun priest is separated from his gun - whether by choice (he holsters his weapon) or by accident (he is disarmed). This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the gun priest's turn.

Vested Weapon				KEY:Gun Priest ~ Vested Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gun Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 1st level, a gun priest gains his vested gun, a single pistol or rifle that is the focus for many of his divine abilities. The gun priest, upon receiving his vested gun, undergoes a religious ceremony that binds him to his vested gun. Anyone else that tries to use the gun priest's vested gun treats it as if it had the broken condition. If the gun priest's vested weapon already has the broken condition, it fails to work for anyone else. The gun priest treats his vested gun with the same reverence he would a holy book or symbol. Accordingly, he never willingly parts with his vested gun - he may not sell it, lend it to others, or otherwise abandon it. If, for any reason, his vested gun is taken from him, the gun priest must do everything in his power to recover it. The gun priest's vested gun may be upgraded and enchanted as normal.
