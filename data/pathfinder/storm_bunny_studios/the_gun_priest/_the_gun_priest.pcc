DESC:The Vested Sons of Velash, a unique sect of dwarven priests, created the very first gun, and with it, ordained Midgard's very first gun priest. Since that day, their ways have spread beyond the dwarven temples that originally birthed them. The men and women who take up this path are a special breed, an elite group that understands there is only one way to win Ragnarï¿½k-through superior firepower.
