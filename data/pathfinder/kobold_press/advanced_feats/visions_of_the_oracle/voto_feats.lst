#Metamagic related
Concentration Spell		FACT:AppliedName|Concentration		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																															DESC:You can extend the duration of your spells through concentration.																								ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																								SOURCEPAGE:p.5																		BENEFIT:When the duration of a spell enhanced by the Concentration Spell feat (called a concentration spell) is set to expire, you may instead concentrate to maintain it. When your concentration ends, so does the spell. Concentration Spell may not be used on spells with an instantaneous or 1 round duration.

Dormant Spell			FACT:AppliedName|Dormant		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																															DESC:You can cast helpful spells that remain dormant until activated.																								ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																								SOURCEPAGE:p.5																		BENEFIT:A dormant spell can only be cast on a willing target. Dormant Spell cannot be used with area of effect spells. When a dormant spell is cast, the effects upon the targets are suppressed until a later time when the spell is activated. Activating a dormant spell requires a standard action by its caster (which provokes an attack of opportunity but is not considered spellcasting), at which time the spell effects take place on its original targets even if they are no longer in the normal range of the spell. Once activated, the effects persist as if the spell had just been cast. When you replenish spells, any dormant spells you have cast are lost. A dormant spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.

You can cast this metamagic-enhanced spell without increasing its casting time but may not cast it without the metamagic it was learned with unless you also learn a version of the spell without metamagic. Adding any metamagic beyond what the spell was learned with increases the casting time for the spell. This does not allow you to apply a given metamagic feat more than once to a spell.
Penetrating Spell		FACT:AppliedName|Penetrating		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																															DESC:Your spells can overcome energy resistance.																										ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																								SOURCEPAGE:p.7																		BENEFIT:A penetrating spell ignores all energy resistance when dealing damage.

A Spiritual Armaments Spell creates ghostly weapons and armor for the undead you summon. The undead are considered proficient with weapons and armor created in this way. The equipment vanishes when the undead are slain or if taken from the undead, but in other respects, it acts as a non-magical item of the same name. Each undead must be equipped identically as determined at the time of casting. A Spiritual Armaments Spell takes up a spell slot a number of levels higher than the spellâ€™s normal level as determined by the sum of the following modifiers. Incorporeal undead cannot be equipped using Spiritual Armaments Spell.
