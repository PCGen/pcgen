Edge of Oblivion.MOD			COST:213015	TYPE:Greater Major	SPROP:+3 adamantine necrotic vorpal longsword (Cost is 213015) Rather than decapitating the victim on a natural 20 critical hit (as with a normal vorpal weapon), the edge of oblivion unleashes a burst of entropic power, aging the creature so far that it is reduced to a fine dust. A creature reduced to dust in this manner can only be revived via miracle, wish, or true resurrection. This ability allows the edge of oblivion to function on creatures that normally would not be slain by a vorpal weapon, such as aberrations, oozes, and undead; however, creatures that are immortal or immune to magical aging become immune to this effect instead. Nightshades, being made of entropy, are also immune to this effect.

# Rings
Shadow Walker's Ring		COST:10000		SORTKEY:Ring	TYPE:Ring.Magic.Lesser Medium		SPROP:The wearer casts illusion spells of the shadow subschool that allow for teleportation at +4 caster level, such as shadow walk, shadow step, shadow space, or shadow gate. When using the shadow walk spell, both the wearer and his companions always arrive on target without being shunted in a random direction upon arrival. In addition, if the wearer has the ability to teleport through the Plane of Shadows a daily distance measured in feet, such as a shadowdancer�s shadow jump ability, a nightblade�s shadow shift, or the shadow step ability of the wizard�s shadow subschool, he can teleport an additional 50 feet each day with that ability. If he has multiple such abilities, he can divide this extra distance between each ability.
Ring of Shadow Mastery		COST:18000		SORTKEY:Ring	TYPE:Ring.Magic.Greater Medium	SPROP:Twice per day, the user can store shadow surges into the ring of shadow mastery. Doing so takes 10 minutes of concentration for each surge. She can store up to 2 shadow surges within the ring in this way. She can spend the shadow surges stored in the ring as normal for her own abilities, or in one of the following ways: As a swift action, the wearer can spend 1 shadow surge stored in the ring to grant herself a +2 insight bonus on Sleight of Hand, Bluff, and Stealth checks for 1 minute. As a swift action, the wearer can spend 1 shadow surge stored in the ring to use the dusk strike nightblade art, allowing her next attack to target touch AC. As a standard action, the wearer of the ring can spend 2 shadow surges stored within the ring to cast shadow conjuration, as the spell (DC 16). Any shadow surges stored in the ring disappear at the start of each day.
