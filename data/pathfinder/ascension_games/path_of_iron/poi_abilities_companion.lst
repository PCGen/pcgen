Link										KEY:Construct Companion ~ Link			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CompanionClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality		DEFINE:CCLinkRangeBonus|0	DESC:(Greater Link) |PREVAREQ:CCGreaterLink,1	DESC:A construct companion is not made nor controlled as a normal construct; it is instead tied to the vanguard's own magical essence, and as such the vanguard shares a special link with his companion. The vanguard can communicate empathically with the companion, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link's limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The vanguard has the same connection to an item or place that the companion does. &nl;However, such a link has its drawbacks. As the companion is powered by the vanguard's magic essence, the construct cannot move more than %1 feet away from the vanguard at any time. If it does, the construct companion immediately shuts down, rendering it helpless and unable to act.|CCLinkRange+CCLinkRangeBonus 	DESC: If it moves further than %1 feet away, but less than %2 feet away, the companion is staggered.|200+CCLinkRangeBonus|CCLinkRange+CCLinkRangeBonus|PREVAREQ:CCGreaterLink,1	DESC: The vanguard must be able to exercise mental control to keep the companion functioning. If the vanguard is ever	DESC: stunned, confused,|PREVAREQ:CCGreaterLink,0	DESC: unconscious, asleep, or killed, the companion cannot act and is considered helpless		DESC:once %1 rounds have passed, unless the Vanguard regains consciousness in this time|ConstructCompanionMasterLVL|PREMULT:2,[PREVAREQ:CCResoluteCompanion,1],[PREVAREQ:CCGreaterLink,1]		DESC:. If the Vanguard is knocked unconscious, falls asleep, or is killed, the Construct Companion remains active for %1 rounds before it shuts down, unless the Vanguard regains consciousness in that time|ConstructCompanionMasterLVL|PREMULT:2,[PREVAREQ:CCResoluteCompanion,1],[PREVAREQ:CCGreaterLink,0]	 DESC:. &nl;In addition, magic items interfere with the vanguard's link to his companion. As a result, the vanguard and his companion share magic item slots. For example, if the vanguard is wearing a ring, the companion can wear no more than one ring. If there is a conflict, the item worn by the vanguard remains active while the item worn by the construct become dormant. Magic weapons do not interfere with the vanguard's link with his companion. &nl;Despite being animated by magic, the construct does not shut down in an antimagic field, though some of its other abilities may be negated.|CCLinkRange+CCLinkRangeBonus	DEFINE:CCLinkRange|0	BONUS:VAR|CCLinkRange|100	BONUS:VAR|CCLinkRange|400|PREVAREQ:CCGreaterLink,1	DEFINE:CCGreaterLink|0	BONUS:VAR|CCGreaterLink|1|PREVARGT:ConstructCompanionMasterLVL,11	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Companion Traits								KEY:Construct Companion ~ Companion Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CompanionClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality							DESC:A construct companion is not built nor animated as a typical construct. It is powered by the vanguard's innate power and intuition rather than careful design, and as such has different abilities from a normal construct. A construct companion has all traits and immunities a normal construct has, except as noted here. Construct companions are not immune to mind-affecting effects, including charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects. A construct companion has an Intelligence score and gains feats and skill points as appropriate for its level, as shown in Table: Construct Companions, and has class skills. A construct companion does not gain bonus hit points based on its size, as a normal construct does. A construct companion has the same weapon proficiencies as the vanguard and can use shields (except tower shields).		SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Integrated Equipment							KEY:Construct Companion ~ Integrated Equipment	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CompanionClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality							DESC:A construct companion can have its weapons or shield integrated into its body, rather than having to hold and stow them as a normal piece of equipment. Any manufactured weapon or shield that is of appropriate size for the construct companion can be integrated. Integrating equipment takes 1 hour of work by the vanguard. After doing so, the item is built directly into the construct's form. It can bring forth the weapon or shield and store it back in its body as if drawing it normally, including reductions in time from feats such as Quick Draw. When stored, the equipment is inside the companion's body and cannot be seen, and its magic aura (if any) cannot be found with spells such as detect magic unless the spell can penetrate through the construct's metallic body. When it draws an integrated weapon or shield, it replaces the hand(s) necessary to wield the item, at which point it can be used as if wielded normally. An integrated weapon or shield cannot be disarmed or stolen, as it's attached directly to the construct's body, though it can be sundered or attacked as normal. &nl;A construct companion can have up to three pieces of integrated equipment at once. If the companion has an integrated ranged weapon, the vanguard can integrate ammunition along with it. Up to 100 pieces of ammunition can be integrated with each ranged weapon. Reloading an integrated weapon is no faster than reloading the weapon as normal, and can be reduced by feats and abilities such as Rapid Reload possessed by the companion. Integrating more ammunition takes 10 minutes of work by the vanguard. &nl;Once a piece of equipment is integrated, it cannot be removed intact. Removing integrated equipment involves either destroying the equipment (though sunder checks and the like) or spending 1 hour removing the item, the process of which gives it the broken condition but leaves it intact enough to be repaired via make whole or similar magic. Removing a ranged weapon requires removing its integrated ammunition, if any.		SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Share Spells								KEY:Construct Companion ~ Share Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CompanionClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. A master may cast spells on his construct companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (construct). Spells cast in this way must come from a class that grants a construct companion. This ability does not allow the construct to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.27
