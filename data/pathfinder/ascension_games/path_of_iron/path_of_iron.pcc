# Vanguard-only implementation from Path of Iron by Ascension Games
#
# Known Issues:
#	- Most new Path of Iron spells not implemented
#	- Dwarf FCB doesn't explicitly designate an item crafting feat, and Aasimar FCB doesn't designate an augmentation -- assumed all ranks go towards a single bonus (not planning to implement further)
#	- No archetypes implemented (not planned)
#	- Companion integrated equipment not limited to three items (probably not reasonably practical to implement)
#	- Vanguard Tactics not implemented (probably not reasonably practical to implement)
