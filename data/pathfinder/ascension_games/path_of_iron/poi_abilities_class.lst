Weapon and Armor Proficiency					KEY:Vanguard ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.SpecialQuality																														DESC:A vanguard is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. Vanguards are also proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A vanguard can cast vanguard spells while wearing light armor or medium armor and using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a vanguard wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass vanguard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

Cantrips								KEY:Vanguard ~ Cantrips					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardCantrips.SpecialQuality																												DESC:Vanguards learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table: Vanguard Spells Known under "Spells Known." These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Construct Companion						KEY:Vanguard ~ Construct Companion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardConstructCompanion.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Construct Companion																				DESC:A vanguard begins play with the ability to craft a powerful, magically-animated construct companion. A construct companion has the same alignment as the vanguard that creates it and can speak and understand all of his languages. Construct companions are treated as constructs under the vanguard's control, though unlike most constructs, the companion is intelligent and capable of independent thought and action.  The construct companion's general appearance is up to the vanguard, though it is always in the form of a medium humanoid shape. The construct companion's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the vanguard's class level and increase as the vanguard gains levels.  A vanguard begins play with his construct companion already constructed. The construct companion does not heal naturally. If it is ever reduced to 0 hit points, the construct companion breaks and stops functioning (though it isn't completely destroyed). The vanguard must spend 24 hours repairing a broken construct companion to fix it, after which it is restored to its full function and hit points. If the construct companion is ever completely annihilated (such as by a disintegrate spell) or is irretrievably lost, the vanguard can spend 1 week crafting a new construct companion to replace his old one. The new construct companion must have the same augmentation abilities as the old one. A vanguard cannot have more than one construct companion at a time.

Augmentation							KEY:Vanguard ~ Augmentation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardAugmentationFeature.SpecialQuality																										DESC:As a vanguard grows in skill, he gains new ways to improve the abilities of his construct companion. Referred to as augmentations, these abilities allow the vanguard to bind additional magical and physical power to his companion, customizing its capabilities to his liking. At 1st level, the vanguard grants his companion the mending touch augmentation and one other augmentation of his choice. At 4th level, and every three vanguard levels thereafter, the vanguard selects another augmentation to apply to his companion. A vanguard cannot select an augmentation more than once, unless otherwise stated.

Resonance								KEY:Vanguard ~ Resonance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardResonance.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:VanguardResonanceUses|0	BONUS:VAR|VanguardResonanceUses|MAX(floor(VanguardLVL/2)+CHA,1)					DESC:The vanguard's augmentations do not only serve to enhance the strengths of his companion. The vanguard has the ability to create a secondary, more powerful effect by causing a resonance between the construct's augmentations and the vanguard's innate magical power. Causing a resonance is a	DESC:standard |PREVARLT:VanguardLVL,7	DESC:move |PREMULT:2,[PREVARLT:VanguardLVL,13],[PREVARGT:VanguardLVL,6]	DESC:swift |PREVARGT:VanguardLVL,12	 DESC:action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The types of resonance the vanguard can create are based on the augmentations he has bestowed upon his construct companion; each resonance effect is listed under its corresponding augmentation. He may only cause one resonance at a time, regardless of how many resonance effects he can use. If he wishes to use a different resonance, he must dismiss the current resonance (a free action) before creating a new one. The vanguard can create %1 resonances each day.  Resonances rely on the construct companion to function; if the construct companion is shut down or destroyed, the vanguard can still use a resonance, but it takes two of his daily uses. In this case, the resonance originates from himself (as if he were the construct companion). If the resonance uses both the construct and the vanguard in tandem (as with the resonance effects for energy discharge or tactical repositioning), he can't use that resonance at all until the construct is functional again.|VanguardResonanceUses																								SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Imbue									KEY:Vanguard ~ Imbue					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardImbue.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																										DESC:At 2nd level, a vanguard learns how to imbue his spells onto himself or his construct companion, binding the magic into a piece of equipment, a weapon, or even the construct's body to be triggered later under a specific condition. This functions similarly to using a contingency spell, though the forms of spells that can be used and how they trigger are more flexible. There are two ways a vanguard can imbue a spell:																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.24
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanguard ~ Imbue.MOD				DESC:&nl;Weapon Imbue: The vanguard can imbue a spell on to a melee weapon, a thrown weapon, or a piece of ammunition. The imbued spell triggers when the weapon or ammunition hits a creature or object. A more specific trigger can be made, such as only discharging when striking an outsider or when striking an object as part of a sunder attempt, subject to GM discretion. If the spell requires an attack roll or has a specific target, it discharges onto the target struck with no further attack roll needed. The discharged spell cannot critically hit, even if it normally could. If the spell targets an area or creatures in an area (such as a fireball spell or a slow spell), the spell's area is centered on the target, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. If a spell is imbued onto a piece of ammunition and the attack misses, the spell is lost. Spells imbued onto melee and thrown weapons last until they are triggered. An imbued spell only functions on weapons that are wielded by the vanguard or his construct companion. A spell can only be imbued into a weapon if it has a casting time of 1 full-round action or less.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanguard ~ Imbue.MOD				DESC:&nl;Personal Imbue: The vanguard can imbue a spell onto either himself or his construct companion. This functions more as a typical contingency effect, where the spell comes into effect on the vanguard or his companion under a specified condition. However, it is not limited to spells that only affect the recipient of the imbued spell. If the spell is normally delivered by touch or targets a creature, it comes into effect upon the recipient of the imbued spell. If the spell targets an area or creatures in an area (such as haste or mass bull's strength), it comes into effect centered on the recipient of the imbued spell, with the recipient of the imbued spell being one of its targets (if any).&nl;A spell can only be imbued if it targets one or more creatures or objects or affects an area. Imbuing a spell takes at least 10 minutes, though it may take longer if the imbued spell has a longer casting time, as described in contingency.&nl;
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanguard ~ Imbue.MOD				DESC:A vanguard can only have one spell imbued at a time, and it must be a spell of 2nd level or lower from the vanguard spell list. |PREVARLT:VanguardLVL,11
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanguard ~ Imbue.MOD				DESC:The vanguard can now maintain up to two imbued spells at once. One of these imbues can be of a spell up to 4th level from the vanguard spell list, the other can only be of a spell up to 2nd level. The spells can be divided between different weapons, between the vanguard and his companion, or any combination therein. However, a single action or attack can only trigger one imbued spell at a time, even if both imbued spells have the same triggering condition. If multiple imbued spells would trigger simultaneously, the vanguard determines which of the two imbued spells trigger. |PREMULT:2,[PREVARLT:VanguardLVL,17],[PREVARGT:VanguardLVL,10]
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanguard ~ Imbue.MOD				DESC:The vanguard can now maintain up to three imbued spells at once. One of these imbues can be of a spell up to 6th level, one can be up to 4th level, and the third can only be of a spell up to 2nd level. The spells can be divided between different weapons, between the vanguard and his companion, or any combination therein. A single action or attack can still only trigger one imbued spell at a time, even if multiple imbued spells have the same triggering condition. |PREVARGT:VanguardLVL,16
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanguard ~ Imbue.MOD				DESC: Imbuing a spell uses up a vanguard spell slot as if the imbued spell had been cast normally. If the imbued spell is not triggered within 24 hours or before the vanguard regains his spells each day, the imbue discharges harmlessly.

Intuitive Construction						KEY:Vanguard ~ Intuitive Construction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardIntuitiveConstruction.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																							DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a vanguard's intuition gives him a bonus on Craft, Disable Device, and Knowledge (Engineering) checks equal to 1/2 his vanguard level. He also receives this bonus on Spellcraft checks made to create or identify a magic item.

Bonus Feats								KEY:Vanguard ~ Bonus Feats				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardBonusFeats.SpecialQuality																											DESC:At 3rd level, and every three vanguard levels thereafter, a vanguard receives a bonus feat. This feat must be chosen from those listed as either teamwork feats or item creation feats. He must meet the prerequisites of these feats as normal. 																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Vanguard Tactics							KEY:Vanguard ~ Vanguard Tactics			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardVanguardTactics.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 3rd level, the vanguard automatically grants his teamwork feats to his construct companion.

Vanguard Arcana Spells						KEY:Vanguard Augmentation ~ Vanguard Arcana Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardArcanaSpells.Extraordinary.SpecialQuality																								DESC:At 5th level, the vanguard gains access to a limited selection of spells to use with his imbue ability. The vanguard can select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard or vanguard spell list and add it to his list of spells known. This must be a spell that he is capable of casting. He may only cast this spell in conjunction with his imbue ability; he may not cast the spell otherwise. At 11th and 17th levels, he learns an additional spell to use with his imbue ability.

Repurpose								KEY:Vanguard ~ Repurpose				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardRepurpose.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																									DESC:At 8th level, the vanguard learns how to reconfigure the magical powers bestowed upon his construct companion. By spending 8 hours altering the magic used to animate his companion, he can exchange one of his augmentations for his companion with a different one. The new augmentation must be one he could have qualified for when he gained the exchanged augmentation; for example, if he removes the augmentation he gained at 7th level, he can replace it with any augmentation with a level requirement of 7th level or lower.																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Rapid Reconstruction						KEY:Vanguard ~ Rapid Reconstruction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardRapidReconstruction.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																							DESC:At 14th level, a vanguard learns how to craft items with rapid speed. He uses the 1/10 gp value of mundane items to determine how much time it takes to craft them, and he requires only half the normal amount of time to create magical items. In addition, it now takes him only 4 hours to restore a construct companion reduced to 0 hit points, or 24 hours to create a replacement for a completely destroyed or lost companion.																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Perfect Resonance							KEY:Vanguard ~ Perfect Resonance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardPerfectResonance.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																								DESC:At 20th level, a vanguard's magical resonance with his construct companion reaches new heights of power. Each day when the vanguard regains spells, he can choose a single augmentation his companion has. The vanguard gains the benefit of that augmentation for the entire day. Whenever he uses the resonance ability for that augmentation, he and his companion gain the benefit of a battlemind link spell for %1 rounds.|MIN(CHA,0)																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.26

Choose a single ability score (except for Constitution). That ability score increases by +2. At 15th level, the bonus increases by an additional +2. This augmentation can be chosen multiple times. Each time it is, it must be applied to a different ability score. &nl;Resonance: The strength of the construct resonates with those nearby.

Ablative Shielding	KEY:Vanguard Augmentation ~ Ablative Shielding		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vanguard Class Feature.VanguardAugmentation.Supernatural.SpecialQuality	DESC:A magical barrier of force surrounds the construct companion, mitigating incoming damage. The barrier grants the construct companion temporary hit points equal to 3 times its total Hit Dice. As long as the barrier has at least 1 temporary hit point remaining, the barrier restores 5 temporary hit points each round, back up to the its normal maximum. If the barrier is ever reduced to 0 hit points, it breaks and does not regain hit points for 1 hour, after which it is restored to 1 hit point.

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanguard Augmentation ~ Ablative Shielding.MOD																				DESC:&nl;Resonance: The barrier supercharges and can affect multiple allies. The temporary hit points of the barrier are restored to double its normal maximum. The barrier protects nearby allies; if an attack would harm an ally within 30 feet of the companion, half of the damage is redirected to the construct's barrier instead. The resonance lasts for either 1 minute or until the barrier runs out of hit points. This resonance cannot be used if the ablative shielding is already at 0 hit points.
