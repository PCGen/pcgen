With a single command you release the resonant energy built up between you and your companion in a wave of force energy, ending the resonance immediately. Each enemy within 20 feet of your construct companion takes 3d8 force damage, is pushed back to the edge of spell's area, and is finally knocked prone.

You can grant it either ranks in a skill or a specific feat. &nl;If you grant it ranks in a skill, you must choose a single skill. You grant it either a number of ranks in that skill equal to half your caster level (max 10) or equal to your own ranks in the skill (max 20). A non-intelligent construct cannot be granted ranks in an Intelligence- or Charisma-based skill. &nl;If you grant it a feat, the construct gains a single feat of your choice. It must be one that the construct can qualify for. &nl;You can cast Enable Function multiple times on a given construct; however, any feats or skill ranks granted by Enable Function cannot be used to meet prerequisites of feats granted by further castings of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Your companion gains a +4 resistance bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects and gains immunity to fear effects. In addition, upon casting Steadfast Companion your companion immediately receives a second saving throw to negate any harmful mind-affecting effect it is currently subject to (with the +4 resistance bonus granted by the spell), using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, the effect ends (or is reduced, in the case of spells with a partial effect on a save) as if your companion had succeeded its initial saving throw against the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The wielder can use this special property multiple times throughout the duration. &nl;Multiple spell storing effects on a given piece of equipment do not stack. If a spell is stored in the armor or weapon when Armament Reservoir ends or is dispelled, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly to no effect. You cannot cast this spell on an unarmed strike or a natural weapon, such as a claw.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Squire's Aid				CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Magus,Paladin,Vanguard=1			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation									COMPS:S						CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:unattended objects within a 10-ft cube							DURATION:8 hours until discharged						SAVEINFO:None										SPELLRES:No						SOURCEPAGE:p.101	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/squire-s-aid						DESC:A handy spell when ambushed during a rest, Squire's Aid packs up belongings and equips creatures. &nl;All objects to be targeted by Squire's Aid must be within a 10-foot cube at the time of casting. All objects are then marked with a small arcane mark that is unreadable, except by means of a Read Magic spell, to anyone but you. Once the objects are marked, they can be thereafter moved about without any issue. &nl;At any point during the spell's duration, you can use a standard action to trigger the effects of Squire's Aid, after which the spell is discharged. All marked objects are packed into their respective containers; bedrolls are rolled and bound, mess kits are cleaned and packed, and bags of supplies are repacked for transportation. Any wearable equipment can be packed in an organized fashion or equipped to nearby creatures, donning the armor and clothing neatly and appropriately for the creature. A creature is aware of what gear you are equipping it with and can prevent you from doing so should it not want you to (no check needed). &nl;All objects that you wish to pack or don or any creatures you wish to equip must be within range of the spell at the time of you triggering these effects, otherwise the effect fails on that particular object or creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Metals and Ores			CLASSES:Alchemist,Ranger,Sorcerer,Vanguard,Wizard=1						SCHOOL:Divination						DESCRIPTOR:metal						COMPS:V, S, F (a small bit of iron ore)	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:60 ft or Long (see text)	TARGETAREA:cone-shaped emanation										DURATION:concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:None										SPELLRES:No						SOURCEPAGE:p.88	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/detect-metals-and-ores				DESC:This spell allows you to detect metal within its area, either worked or unrefined. When you cast Detect Metals and Ores, you must designate whether you want to find either metal or metal ore. The spell functions differently depending on your choice. &nl;If you choose to detect metal, the spell detects all worked metal in a 60-foot cone. This includes weapons, armor, doors, tools, constructs, and so on that are made of a refined metal or metal alloy. This version of the spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt or 1 foot of stone blocks it. &nl;If you choose to detect ores, the spell detects all unrefined metal within a long range (400 ft. + 40 ft./ level). This version is not blocked by barriers, wood, dirt, or stone, but can only detect unrefined ore, whether it has been mined or is still in the ground. Metal that has been smelted down or refined in any way is not detected by this version of the spell. &nl;With either choice, you can choose to detect a specific form of metal (such as iron, mithral, or gold), in which case the spell only shows you the location of that metal and no others.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Refine Ore					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Vanguard,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:earth,metal					COMPS:V, S, M (a lump of coal)		CASTTIME:1 minute			RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:unrefined ore with a total volume less than (5*CASTERLEVEL) cu ft			DURATION:instantaneous								SAVEINFO:None										SPELLRES:No						SOURCEPAGE:p.97	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/refine-ore						DESC:You turn unrefined ore into usable materials. Refine Ore smelts all metals within the ore into usable ingots, and pulls out all valuable gems without damaging them (though it leaves the gemstones rough and uncut). The amount of ore and gemstones found within the ore is subject to GM discretion. &nl;The spell generates no heat, and the stone that would be left behind after the metal and gems have been extracted is compacted into 1-foot cubes for transportation. Refine Ore can only be used on ore that has been mined out and separated from the surrounding stone; you cannot cast it on the walls of a mineshaft and extract any materials, for example.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Weapon				CLASSES:Bloodrager,Magus,Ranger,Sorcerer,Vanguard,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S						CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:weapon touched											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)						SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)		SOURCEPAGE:p.89	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/energy-weapon						DESC:This spell functions as Magic Weapon, except that instead of granting a +1 enhancement bonus you instead grant the weapon your choice of either the flaming, frost, or shock special weapon property. Duplicate abilities on a weapon do not stack. &nl;At 11th caster level and higher, you can instead grant the weapon flaming burst, icy burst, or shocking burst.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Weaken structure affects one %1-foot cube of material; if the target is too large to fit in this area, only the portion within the area is affected. &nl;The affected portion of the object or structure is made more vulnerable to damage, reducing its hardness by 10 (minimum 0) and reducing its hit points to 10 per inch of thickness; if the object already has less than 10 hit points per inch or thickness (such as ice or leather), it is reduced to 1 hit point per inch of thickness. &nl;The effects of weaken structure are removed after the spell ends, but any portions of the structure damaged or destroyed during the spell remain that way.|5*CASTERLEVEL|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

This spell allows your construct companion to venture more than 100 feet away from you without penalty (or greater distance, if the companion has the greater link ability). It can travel any distance while this spell is in effect without penalty, but if the spell expires while the construct is farther than its link allows, it runs the risk becoming staggered or shutting down entirely.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Steel Sight					CLASSES:Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Vanguard,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Divination						DESCRIPTOR:metal						COMPS:V, S, M (one silver coin)		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:60 ft					TARGETAREA:cone-shaped emanation										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:None										SPELLRES:No						SOURCEPAGE:p.102	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/steel-sight						DESC:When you cast this spell, your eyes glaze over with a silver sheen before polishing, appearing as though your eyes were actually mirrors. &nl;Steel Sight lets you see through metal as if it were invisible. You can see through walls, armor, weapons, containers, objects, and creatures that are made of metal. This can even penetrate metals that normally block divinations, such as lead. However, this does not allow any other divination effects you have active to bypass metal. &nl;Normally you see through any sort of metal, but you can designate either a specific metal to see through, or see through all metals save for a specific type.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ward Object					CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Summoner,Vanguard,Wizard=2				SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S						CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:object touched											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged			SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)						SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)		SOURCEPAGE:p.107	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/ward-object						DESC:This spell functions as Protection from Energy, except it can only affect objects and lasts for much longer.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The fire lingers an additional %1 rounds, dealing an additional 4d4 fire damage each round. A Fortitude save can be made to halve the fire damage in that round only. &nl;A creature or object that is submersed in water stops burning and takes no damage so long as it remains submersed, but if it emerges from the water while combustion has duration remaining, the target is set alight again. Particularly flammable objects or constructs, such as those made of wood or cloth, or are covered in flammable oils, may have their hardness bypassed and take full damage from combustion (rather than the normal half), subject to GM discretion.|floor(CASTERLEVEL/2)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reconstruct					CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Vanguard,Wizard=5								SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S, see text				CASTTIME:1 minute			RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:object of up to (20*CASTERLEVEL) cu ft or one construct creature of any size	DURATION:instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)						SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/reconstruct						DESC:This spell functions like Make Whole, except when used on an object or construct it restores it to its full hit points. Reconstruct can repair any items that Make Whole can. &nl;Reconstruct has a more powerful function that allows its caster to rebind the animating forces to a destroyed construct, essentially raising it from "death". The construct cannot have been destroyed for more than %1 days. The construct is repaired to half its maximum hit points. While reconstruct fixes nearly any sort of damage or disrepair, the body of the construct must be whole. Any missing parts remain missing and must be repaired by other means, usually through the use of the Craft Construct feat, subject to GM discretion. &nl;Reconstructing a destroyed construct requires a material component consisting of precious gemstones such as rubies, sapphires, or diamonds worth a total of 500 gp per hit die of the destroyed construct. When targeting a construct, Reconstruct bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.|CASTERLEVEL|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Replicate					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=6|Vanguard=5							SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation									COMPS:V, S						CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:object weighing no more than (5*CASTERLEVEL) lbs						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:None										SPELLRES:No						SOURCEPAGE:p.97	SOURCELINK:https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/ascension-games/replicate						DESC:You create a replica of an existing object. The replicated object appears in your hand if you desire, or in the hands of a willing creature within range of the spell, otherwise it appears in the nearest open space. The object has the same shape, size, coloration, weight, and use as the original, appearing to be an exact replica, though it does not have any magical properties. An Appraise check or appropriate Craft or Knowledge check can be made to identify that it's not the original object. The DC of this check is %1 for the Craft check, or %2 when making an Appraise or Knowledge check. &nl;If the original object is masterwork, so is the duplicate. The new object has the same material properties as the original, even if made out of a special material like adamantine or cold iron. If the original object has less than full hit points, you can make the replicated item have the same hit points or be created with full hit points, even if the original item has the broken condition (but is not destroyed). The replicated item does not have any magical properties of the original. &nl;You cannot replicate an artifact with this spell.|CASTERLEVEL+15|CASTERLEVEL+20|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The companion appears anywhere within 100 feet of you that you designate. &nl;If your construct companion is destroyed, the spell fails, but you know roughly where your companion's remains are. This spell does not work across planes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The uses of spikes vary greatly, as shown below:|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spikes.MOD						DESC:&nl;* You can cover a weapon in spikes. A weapon with spikes can be used to deal piercing damage (if it couldn't already) and causes creatures struck to take 1 point of bleeding damage each round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Spikes.MOD						DESC:&nl;* You can make a creature's skin grow spikes. You can affect all or some of its body.

Spikes.MOD						DESC:&nl;* You can make a single unattended object spiky all over. The object cannot exceed %1 cubic feet. Any creature that carries, wears, touches, or wields the object takes 1d6 piercing damage each round.|min(2*CASTERLEVEL,20)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spikes.MOD						DESC:&nl;The spell can create any other effect that would logically extend from making an object spiky, such as growing spikes from boots or a wagon wheel to create traction, subject to GM discretion. A creature or magic item that does not wish to receive a spikes spell can make a Will save to negate its effects, and spell resistance applies. Non-magic items do not receive a saving throw unless they are attended.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
