SOURCEPAGE:p.49																																		BENEFIT:You can use your tongue as a weapon or to hold small objects. Your tongue can extend up to 10 feet from your mouth, appearing as a reddish-pink suckerless tentacle. The tongue can make a single attack at your highest base attack bonus, dealing 1d6 points of damage + 1/2 Strength bonus (1d4 + 1/2 Strength if you are Small in size) against any target within reach. This attack can be made even if you make a full attack with handheld weapons or cast a spell in the round. The tongue tentacle can also grasp objects of up to Small size and move them about. You can hold a key ring to open a locked door, pick up a potion vial, or even attempt to grapple a creature of Small size or smaller (using your normal CMB). While you can grasp, hold and move Small weapons with the tongue tentacle, the grip is not sure enough to allow you a viable attack with that weapon. If you attempt to attack with a weapon held in the tongue tentacle, you do so at a -5 penalty to the attack roll, and you cannot score a critical hit with the weapon, even on a natural roll of 20. You cannot speak or cast spells requiring verbal components while using the prehensile tongue power.
