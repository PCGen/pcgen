Proficiencies		KEY:Proficiencies ~ Talented Monk			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedMonkClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, shortspear, short sword, sling, and spear.  The monk uses his base attack bonus when using these weapons, or weapon with which he is not proficient.

Monk Edges			KEY:Monk Edges ~ Talented Monk			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedMonkClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Every monk has a unique outlook on life, which colors what threats she takes seriously, what esoteric skills she studies, and what kinds of tricks and knacks she picks up. These abilities, known as edges, help a monk act as an assassin, scout, expert treasure locator, or some combination or roles that appeal to her in particular. A monk gains an edge at 1st level, and additional edges at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 8th level, and a final edge at 20th level. Edges are similar to monk talents, but are more fundamental to her background and worldview, and require constant and regular practice to keep effective. As a result there's a limit to how many edges a monk can have, and most edges must be selected early in the monk's career. While a monk gains multiple edges over her first few levels, those acquisitions represent the culmination of years (possibly a lifetime) of effort and study. A monk may not decide to take the evasion edge until 4th level, but she has been thinking about how to escape explosions and practicing her ideas for long years before her acumen rises to the level of that edge. A monk may not take an edge more than once unless it specifies otherwise. Some edges are taken from various monk archetypes. These edges include the name of their originating archetype as a descriptor, to allow GMs to limit characters to edges from a single archetype (if desired).

Monk Talents		KEY:Monk Talents ~ Talented Monk			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedMonkClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a talented monk gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 1st, a talented monk gains one monk talent. She gains an additional monk talent for every level of monk attained after 1st. A monk cannot select an individual talent more than once unless the talent specifies otherwise. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a monk's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made, and a monk must have selected the sneak attack talent at least once before selecting any talents that modify it. Some talents are taken from various monk archetypes. These talents include the name of their originating archetype as a descriptor, to all GMs to limit characters to talents from a single archetype, if desired.

Advanced Talents		KEY:Advanced Talents ~ Talented Monk		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedMonkClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, and every monk level thereafter, a monk can choose advanced talents in place of a monk talent. Advanced talents otherwise follow the rules for talents.

Grand Talent		KEY:Grand Talent ~ Talented Monk			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TalentedMonkClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level a monk may select one grand talent.

Evasion			KEY:Talented Monk Edge ~ Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.Edges.TalentedMonkEdge.SpecialQuality													DESC:The monk can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the monk is wearing light armor or no armor. (Monks with the medium armor kata talent are exceptions to this rule.) A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

If the check succeeds, the martial artist gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of his turn, and any attacks he makes until the end of his turn ignore the creature or object's DR  or hardness. A martial artist may instead use this ability to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saves and a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to %1 until the start of his next turn.|if(MonkLVL/2<1,1,MonkLVL/2)																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.3

Apply this bonus before modifying the monk's speed because of any load carried or armor worn (though like all monk talents fast movement cannot be used by a monk in armor without the light armor kata or medium armor kata edges). This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the monk's land speed.  If the monk is 6th level or higher, his land speed is 20 feet faster than the norm for his race. This increases by another 10 feet for every 3 levels above 6th, to a maximum of 60 feet faster than the norm for his race at 18th level.																																																																																																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Talented Monk Edge ~ Light Armor Kata													BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Walk|TMFMBonus|TYPE=Enhancement|PREVAREQ:ENCUMBERANCE,0,var("COUNT[EQTYPE.ARMOR.EQUIPPED]"),0		BONUS:VAR|TMFMBonus|if(floor(MonkLVL/3)<1,10,10*floor(MonkLVL/3))								SOURCEPAGE:p.3

Fighting Style		KEY:Talented Monk Edge ~ Fighting Style			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.Edges.TalentedMonkEdge.SpecialQuality													DESC:Most monks are trained in one of more fighting styles, a specific way of using a set of similar weapons to perform martial arts maneuvers.  Offensive edges and talents marked with an asterisk* can only be performed with weapons in a weapon group the monk has selected with this edge.  Select one weapon group below. This list is identical to the weapon group list from The Genius Guide to the Talented Fighter, with the exception of excluding the Siege Weapon Group (no matter how good a monk is, he cannot deliver a stunning fist attack through a catapult) and the addition of the improvised weapon group (which includes anything the GM would allow to be used as an improvised weapon). GMs may add other weapons to any weapon group, or add entirely new groups.  The monk is proficient with all weapons in the selected group, and may use his specialty attack bonus (from Table 1: The Talented Monk on page 2) when making an attack or combat maneuver with one of these weapons, and treats them all as if they had the ki focus ability (allowing him to use abilities and attacks that normally work with unarmed attacks, such as Stunning Fist and Punishing Kick, with these weapons). The monk may also deal lethal or nonlethal damage with any weapons in a group he has selected without  penalty.  This edge may be selected more than once. Each time it is selected, it grants proficiency and the ability to use weapon related monk edges and talents with weapons of another group.

When doing so he may make one additional attack using a weapon for which he has taken the fighting style edge or adaptive fighting talent. All the monk's attacks for the round, including the additional attack, suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls. All the attacks the monk makes in the round must be with weapons with which he can use his special attack bonus. The monk may make all the attacks with a single weapon, or may make them interchangeably with any qualifying weapons he is wielding.  At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he uses flurry of blows. At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using flurry of blows. A monk applies his full Strength bonus to his damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made unarmed, with an off-hand weapon, or with a weapon wielded in both hands. A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows.

Unfettered Kata		KEY:Talented Monk Edge ~ Unfettered Kata			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.Edges.TalentedMonkEdge.SpecialQuality													DESC:Many monks learn a fighting style that focuses on being free of needing any weapon or armor in combat. When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flatfooted. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load. This is true even if he has an edge or talent that allows him to use other monk edges and monk talents when wearing armor. A monk that selects this edge also gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat as a bonus feat, and is treated as having the fighting style edge with his unarmed strikes (but not other natural attacks he may have). His unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

He usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided that he has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the monk cannot see still has total concealment against him, and the monk still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.

He may use counter-grapple even if his attacker has concealment or total concealment. If the monk is 8th level or higher he may do this even if he is flat-footed or if his attacker has exceptional reach. A monk must have the graceful grappler edge to select this talent.

Deadly Strikes 			KEY:Talented Monk Talent ~ Deadly Strikes 		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassAbility.TalentedMonkTalent.SpecialQuality			DESC:The monk is a master of using his superior body control to deal surprising amounts of damage with weapons.  The monk may be able to replace its base damage dice, depending on the weapon and the monk's level.  Deadly Strikes depends on the monk to easily adapt his own superior body control through weapon blows, and thus is easier to use with more basic weapons. When using a weapon that only threatens a critical hit on a natural 20 and that has only a x2 crit multiple (including unarmed attacks), the monk compares the die listed on Deadly Strikes Table 1 for a monk of his level and size to the weapon's base damage die. If the table's die is superior, the monk uses it instead of the weapon's normal damage die whenever the monk deals damage with that weapon. When using more complex weapons (which are often more effective as weapons, but more difficult to improve with the monk's superior control of his own movements), deadly strikes aren't quite as effective. Instead of the die values on Deadly Strikes Table 1, the monk checks the dice listed on Deadly Strikes Table 2.  This ability automatically increases Unarmed if qualified.  For other weapons, see charts on Pg.8 and make a custom weapon based on appropriate damage.		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Monk ~ Unarmed Damage|PREVARGTEQ:DeadlyUnarmed,1										SOURCEPAGE:8
