###Block: Prestige Award - Vanity - Businesses
#While adventuring can be lucrative, it doesn't provide the job security some Pathfinders might wish for, nor does it provide a creative outlet for those with an artistic flair. As such, many Pathfinders own or operate small businesses on the side when not traveling the Inner Sea for the Society. A PC may purchase the same business more than once, with each purchase representing the endeavor's growth over time. Circumstance bonuses granted by businesses stack, including for multiple instances of a given vanity. You can purchase more than one business, but this does not increase the number of times per session that you can make a Day Job check.

###Block: Prestige Award - Vanity - Followers
#Not every Pathfinder is a natural loner or forced by circumstance to work in a team with others like him. In fact, some have small retinues of underlings who travel with them, taking care of menial tasks and hoping to soak up some of the glory that comes from adventuring with a member of the Pathfinder Society. All of the followers listed below are noncombatants, and should be utilized as flavor for a character, not as a means of slowing down the game and overcomplicating the board with unneeded minis. You can have a maximum number of followers equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum of 1); you may dismiss a follower from service at any time if you wish to gain different followers, but do not regain spent Prestige Points when you do so. If your Charisma is lowered by an effect, this does not impact any followers you may have already purchased, but does affect the number of new followers you can gain.

When you rest at your home, you automatically heal as if under long-term care using the Heal skill. In order to gain the service of such an individual, however, you must own property or a business, either in Absalom or elsewhere. You may retain the services of one seneschal per property-seneschals do not count against the normal maximum number of followers you can retain at a time.
