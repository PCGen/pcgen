Nex’s legendary spirit is more powerful and willful than most legendary spirits, however; it embraces only mediums who visit distinct locations and master opening their third eyes.

Nex Spirit				NAMEISPI:YES	KEY:Medium ~ Nex Spirit						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.MediumSpirit.LegendaryMediumSpirit																																				DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:Nex's legendary spirit offers the power of one of the greatest archmages in Golarion’s history. Unlike normal archmage spirits, Nex’s legendary spirit grants strange abilities shaped by the lost wizard’s unique experiments. Mediums channeling Nex’s legendary spirit eventually realize that the spirit has its own long-term plans for them, usually involving the Spire of Nex, but so far no medium has gleaned the full scope of that plan. The Nex legendary spirit grants modified or unique spirit powers. In all other ways, it functions identically to a standard archmage spirit (Occult Adventures 33).&nl;	DESC:Favored Locations: Arcane redoubts, areas of unusual magic, libraries, schools.&nl; |PREVARLT:SpiritHideLocation,1	DESC:Influence Penalty: Your body begins to respond as if you were a frail, aged scholar.

For each level of spell you can now cast (including level 0), each time you channel Nex’s spirit, select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list of that level to add to your medium spell list and spells known until you lose contact with Nex. When you cast these spells, they count as arcane (though not for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites), and thus you must provide verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components. Because of Nex’s hatred of Geb, these spells can’t be of the necromancy school.

You can expend a spell slot to cast shadow conjuration, mimicking a summon monster or summon nature’s ally spell of the spell slot’s level (or that spell slot’s level + 1 for 5th- and 6th-level slots). These shadows are 10%% real per level of the spell slot expended. If you allow Nex to gain 1 point of influence over you, double the reality percentage (to a maximum of 100%%; if the result would be greater than 100%%, the creature or creatures instead gain the advanced template).

Personal Spire						KEY:Medium ~ Nex ~ Personal Spire				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																							DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:Nex’s legendary spirit grants you access to a personal demiplane that you create (as per one created by create greater demiplane). As long as you channel Nex each day, your demiplane remains, but if you ever channel a spirit from a different legend, the demiplane disappears, dumping its inhabitants onto the Astral Plane. You can use project servitor to summon a shadowy projection of any creature currently within your demiplane, as long as its CR matches the summon spell (CR 1/2 or lower for summon monster I, CR 1 for summon monster II, CR 2 for summon monster III, CR 3 or 4 for summon monster IV, CR 5 or 6 for summon monster V, CR 7 or 8 for summon monster VI, or CR 9 or 10 for summon monster VII). You can allow Nex to gain 1 point of influence over you and expend a 6th-level spell slot to use project servitor as per summon monster VIII (80%% real and can mimic trapped creatures of CR 11 or 12) or summon monster IX (90%% real and can mimic trapped creatures of CR 13 or 14).

Chain of Eyes						KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Chain of Eyes				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The subject can share her senses with the mesmerist. The mesmerist triggers chain of eyes by closing his eyes and concentrating on the implanted subject, allowing the mesmerist to see and hear everything the target experiences with her own senses of sight and hearing (including any special senses or magical effects). Once triggered, chain of eyes lasts for %1 minutes or until the mesmerist shifts his field of vision back to himself as a free action. While viewing events from the target’s perspective, the mesmerist is flat-footed, even if he can see himself from another perspective.|MesmeristLVL
Slip Bonds						KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Slip Bonds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:While implanted with this trick, the subject gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks. If the subject becomes grappled, pinned, shackled, or otherwise personally restrained, the mesmerist can trigger the trick and cause the subject to become incorporeal just long enough to slip her bonds (unless they can otherwise restrain an incorporeal creature). This effect doesn’t last long enough for the subject to move through walls or other barriers. If the mesmerist is 12th level, the subject remains incorporeal until the beginning of the mesmerist’s next turn.
Unwitting Messenger					KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Unwitting Messenger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The mesmerist describes a recipient to the subject while implanting this trick, then recites a verbal message no longer than %1 words. The subject of unwitting messenger has no memory of the message or the target recipient. When the subject encounters the specified recipient, she repeats the message verbatim, but does not recall speaking the message or its contents. The message remains buried in the subject’s subconscious for 24 hours, after which time it disappears if not delivered. The subject of unwitting messenger can be fooled by mundane disguises or illusions, causing her to deliver the message to the wrong recipient.|MesmeristLVL*5

When the subject attempts to lie, the mesmerist can trigger this trick. That particular lie resists truth-detecting magic, and creatures attempting to use such magic must succeed at a caster level check against a DC %1 to succeed; failure means the magic doesn’t detect the subject’s lie or force her to speak only the truth.|15+MesmeristLVL

Without this implement, the reliquarian cannot use her domain powers and must succeed at a Concentration check to cast spells from her domain.

Unlike a wizard’s spellbook, this grimoire doesn’t contain specific spells. By studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed, he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it is replaced, which requires 1 week of work.

Treat this construct as a clockwork spy (Bestiary 3 p58), except it has half its master’s total hit points regardless of its Hit Dice and can write and take dictation rather than record audio. If worn in the true silvered throne’s amulet slot, the golden scarab provides a +4 bonus to AC against sneak attacks and attacks of opportunity, as the scarab animates and moves to intercept attacks. If lost or destroyed, the golden scarab can be replaced in a week-long ritual costing 250 gp.		AUTO:EQUIP|Scarab of the Second Throne
