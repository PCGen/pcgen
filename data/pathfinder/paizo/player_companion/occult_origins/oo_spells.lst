Death Pact			TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist=5|Psychic,Witch=6							SCHOOL:Enchantment				DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 minute		COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One creature					DURATION:24 hours							SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text					SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.13		DESC:You take control of a creature’s mind and implant deadly subconscious commands. This spell functions as dominate person, allowing you to control your subject and see through her senses, but also implants a powerful burst of psychic energy in the subject’s mind. At any point during the spell’s duration, you can trigger this burst as an immediate action, dealing (CASTERLEVEL)d8 points of damage (Fortitude half) to the subject. If this damage is enough to reduce to target to 0 or fewer hit points, the target dies instantly. Your target can also willingly trigger this psychic burst as an immediate action. You can specify conditions (such as being captured) when she should do so, though such orders are considered dangerous and allow the subject a new Will saving throw with a +2 bonus. [Material Components] a contract signed in blood
Dream Shield			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Medium,Mesmerist,Shaman=2|Psychic=3|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Abjuration									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Creature touched				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:You ward the target’s mind against intrusion and influence while she is unconscious. While sleeping, the target is protected against divinations such as nondetection and gains spell resistance (10+CASTERLEVEL) against mind-affecting effects. In addition, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spell or effect that would possess or exercise direct mental control over her. This functions in all respects like the second property of protection from evil but it applies regardless of the alignment of the creature or object that created the possession or mental influence effect. If the target is awake, instead of the previous effects, the dream shield provides a +4 bonus on saving throws against sleep effects. The spell’s other effects are suppressed while the target is awake. If the target falls asleep or is otherwise rendered unconscious, the other effects of the dream shield resume. Every 10 minutes spent awake consumes 1 hour of the dream shield’s duration. [Material Components] hollow glass ball or dreamcatcher
Ectoplasmic Hand		TYPE:Psychic			CLASSES:Spiritualist=4|Occultist,Psychic=5							SCHOOL:Evocation									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:One ectoplasmic appendage			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:You draw forth a ghostly, animated hand through the ectoplasmic veil to manipulate objects, attack creatures, and deliver touch spells at a distance. The hand remains tethered to you by tendrils of ectoplasm. The ectoplasmic hand and its tether have hardness 10 and (CASTERLEVEL+10) hit points. The tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length, ending the spell. The ectoplasmic hand has improved evasion, uses your save bonuses, and has an AC of 24 (+6 natural armor, +8 size). The ectoplasmic hand moves up to 30 feet per round, and on each of your turns you can spend a move action to move it an additional 30 feet. If you spend a swift action, the ectoplasmic hand can make an attack using your base attack bonus, modifying its attack rolls and damage rolls with your spellcasting ability score (the ability score that determines your spell save DCs). It deals 1d6 points of damage with a slam attack, and it can wield any light or one-handed weapon. The ectoplasmic hand threatens and can flank targets. The ectoplasmic hand can also perform additional functions. [Deliver Touch Spell] The ectoplasmic hand can deliver any spell of 6th level or lower that has a range of touch that you cast. You gain a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll when doing so. [Manipulate Object] The ectoplasmic hand can manipulate unattended objects weighing no more than (5*CASTERLEVEL) pounds, moving them up to 20 feet per round in any direction you desire, to the limits of this spell’s range. It can pull levers, open unstuck doors, or knock over objects. If the ectoplasmic hand must attempt a Strength check, it uses your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score. Using the ectoplasmic hand in this way requires you to concentrate and spend any actions you would normally need to use to manipulate the object yourself. [Combat Maneuver] You can spend a standard action to command the ectoplasmic hand to perform a bull rush, disarm, drag, steal, or trip combat maneuver against a target creature, using your caster level as its CMB and your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score. The ectoplasmic hand takes no penalties for its size. This action doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity against the ectoplasmic hand.
Fool's Teleport			TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Mesmerist=3|Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer						CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V		RANGE:Personal and touch	TARGETAREA:You and other touched willing creatures	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); see text			SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.13		DESC:This spell instantly renders you unseen as per invisibility, but creates a visual and auditory display that makes it appear as if you had teleported away. You can affect (CASTERLEVEL/3) additional Medium or smaller creatures or the equivalent(a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth). All creatures to be affected must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. If a viewer identifies the spell with a successful Spellcraft check, she can attempt an immediate Will saving throw as if interacting with an illusion. With a successful Will save, the observer can correctly identify fool’s teleport for what it is; otherwise, she perceives the spell to be dimension door, teleport, or similar conjuration magic. A successful Will save doesn’t negate the invisibility.
Implanted Projection		TYPE:Psychic			CLASSES:Mesmerist,Psychic=3									SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Emotion|Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:One creature					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days						SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.13		DESC:This spell functions as telempathic projection, except its mood-altering effects remain dormant in the target’s mind. Upon casting this spell, the caster designates a command word or phrase, of which the target retains no memory. The next creature to speak the command word or phrase to the target triggers the implanted telempathic projection, treating the speaker as the original spellcaster.
Jealous Rage			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Bloodrager,Mesmerist,Spiritualist=2|Psychic,Shaman,Witch=3		SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Emotion|Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:One living creature				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]					SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:You fill the target with a sense of entitled self-importance, making the subject unable to bear the indignity of another creature getting something that it doesn’t have. Whenever an ally of the target receives a harmless spell or spell-like ability, beneficial supernatural effect, or assisting action (including the aid another action, first aid using the Heal skill, etc.) that doesn’t also include the target, the target is driven into a murderous rage against either the producer of that effect or the nearest creature that benefited from that effect, whichever is closer. The target must attack that creature on its next turn. Any ability that deals lethal damage is considered an attack for this purpose. Once the target deals lethal damage to the object of his jealous rage, the compulsion to attack that creature ends.
Mantle of Doubt			TYPE:Psychic			CLASSES:Mesmerist=6|Psychic=8									SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm	DESCRIPTOR:Emotion|Fear|Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]																SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:You wrap your mind in phantasms of crippling doubt that assail any who dare harm you. When a creature within the mantle’s radius attacks you or attempts to affect you with a harmful effect, it must succeed at a Will save as these spectres of uncertainty force themselves into its mind. Ongoing effects trigger the mantle only if the creature consciously directs them against you. A given creature need only roll a saving throw against your mantle of doubt at most once per round. If the creature’s attack or effect against you was a psychic spell or spell-like ability, that creature’s save takes a –4 penalty. A creatures that fails its save against your mantle of doubt is affected for 1d4+1 rounds, during which time it is shaken, cannot flank, and no longer threatens creatures within its reach. In addition, it takes a –2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects, which stacks with the penalties for being shaken. If your mantle of doubt affects a creature that is already shaken, that creature’s fear level doesn’t increase. Instead, mounting doubts stagger the creature for 1 round and deal 1d4 points of Wisdom and Charisma damage to it. Spell resistance applies against assaults from a mantle of doubt, and immunity to fear or mind-affecting effects negates the spell’s effects. If you are immune to fear or mind-affecting effects, you can still cast mantle of doubt on yourself.
Mind over Matter		TYPE:Psychic			CLASSES:Mesmerist,Psychic,Spiritualist=2							SCHOOL:Necromancy									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One creature					DURATION:Instantaneous							SAVEINFO:Fort negates						SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:You blur the lines between mind and body, reassigning ability damage or drain your target has taken to a corresponding ability score, as follows; Strength==Intelligence; Dexterity==Wisdom; Constitution==Charisma. The transfer of damage can go either way—you can convert Intelligence damage to Strength damage and vice versa. You can transfer any number of points of damage or drain in a single casting, though only from one ability score to the corresponding ability score. You cannot transfer enough ability damage or drain to reduce an ability score to 0.
Mindshock			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bloodrager,Inquisitor,Medium,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Spiritualist,Witch=2	SCHOOL:Divination				DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting|Pain		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]																SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:You charge yourself with violent psychic energy so attacks you make with weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes cause the target to recall pain suffered in the past. Such attacks deal 1d4 points of nonlethal damage in addition to their normal damage, though creatures immune to mind-affecting or pain effects ignore this additional damage. In addition, when you confirm a critical hit, the target is confused for 1 round by the pain. Creatures immune to critical hits, mind-affecting, or pain effects ignore the confusion. Even if you confirm multiple critical hits while this spell is in effect, an individual creature can only be confused by a single casting of mindshock once.
Out of Sight			TYPE:Psychic			CLASSES:Medium,Mesmerist=3|Psychic=4								SCHOOL:Enchantment				DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]; see text				SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text					SPELLRES:Yes; see text	SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:The spell inhibits the memories of creatures that perceive you. While creatures can perceive you normally, when a creature stops observing you, it must attempt a Will save (spell resistance applies). If it fails, it loses all memory of its awareness of you and your actions while you were under the effects of this spell. The spell’s duration listed above measures how long the out of sight effect lasts on you, but the memory alteration is instantaneous and can be reversed only by magic such as modify memory. The creature is still aware of any other changes to itself or its environment. For instance, a guard will remember running, and may notice a newly unlocked door, but will not remember that he was chasing after you. [Material Components] a strip of black cloth
Phantom Limb			TYPE:Psychic			CLASSES:Spiritualist=5|Psychic=6								SCHOOL:Necromancy									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One creature					DURATION:24 hours; see text						SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This spell creates a semi-visible psychic manifestation that allows a creature to replace a missing body part or parts. This could be as simple as a missing finger or toe or as complex as one or more limbs or even a set of wings. The creature can use these ghostly appendages exactly as if they were the creature’s own limbs, including any natural attacks or other special abilities. This includes any extraordinary abilities granted by the appendages, but not supernatural ones. If the target does not need a replacement limb (or chooses not to use the spell in this way), it can instead select one of the following options. In this case, the spell lasts only for (10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes. [Extra Arms] The target grows two phantom arms, granting it two extra natural claw attacks; the target cannot use the phantom arms for any other purpose. [Extra Legs] The target grows two phantom legs and strong hindquarters like those of a horse, granting it a +30-foot enhancement bonus to speed and a +4 bonus to its CMD against overrun and trip combat maneuvers. [Mermaid’s Tail] The target grows a phantom tail, granting it a swim speed of 60 feet. [Phantom Wings] The target grows phantom wings, granting it a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).
Psychic Leech			TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Mesmerist,Psychic,Spiritualist,Witch=2|Bloodrager,Magus,Medium,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Emotion|Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:S		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:One living creature				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]					SAVEINFO:Will partial						SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:The target experiences feelings of ennui and lethargy, becoming fatigued for the spell’s duration. While the target is fatigued and is within the spell’s range, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. On a successful save, the target is fatigued for only 1d4 rounds and you receive no bonus. This spell has no effect if it targets a creature that is already fatigued.
Psychonaut Manifestation	TYPE:Psychic			CLASSES:Psychic=2										SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Emotion|Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]					SAVEINFO:See text									SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:You take a mental journey through the doors of perception to enter an altered state of consciousness. Despite this hallucinatory transmigration being entirely unreal, your mind and body fully react to it. You gain a +4 alchemical bonus to a random ability score, as well as a corresponding –2 penalty. If the bonus applies to Strength, the penalty applies to Intelligence, and vice versa. If the bonus applies to Dexterity, the penalty applies to Wisdom, and vice versa. If the bonus applies to Constitution, the penalty applies to Charisma, and vice versa. Each round as a standard action, you can explore the nooks and crannies of your imagination to further alter your corporal self. If you do so, attempt a Will save against the spell’s save DC. If you succeed, randomly select another ability score and change the alchemical bonus and associated penalty accordingly. If you fail, you are dazed for 1 round instead as your mind reels from learning unexpected truths about yourself. [Material Components] a small piece of psychoactive cactus
Quell Energy			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Druid,Inquisitor,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Abjuration									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:One creature					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds						SAVEINFO:Will partial						SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:You reduce the target creature’s ability to tap into a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) of your choice. This reduces damage of the selected type the creature deals with spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities by %1 points. Multiple castings of this spell stack. Damage from sources other than the creature, such as objects and magic items, is not reduced. If the damage of one of the creature’s effects is negated entirely, any additional effects associated with that damage (such being stunned by sound burst or set on fire by a fire elemental) are also negated. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the spell’s duration is reduced to 1 round.|10*(1+(CASTERLEVEL>=13)+(CASTERLEVEL>=19)
Retributive Reparations		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Inquisitor,Occultist,Spiritualist=3|Witch=4					SCHOOL:Necromancy				DESCRIPTOR:Curse			CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One object					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days or until triggered, and permanent; see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object) and Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:If a creature successfully takes the item targeted by this spell while you are holding, wearing, or wielding it, the creature must attempt a Will save. If the creature fails its save, it becomes fatigued, and it must attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn every round it does not return the item to you. Failing a second saving throw causes the target to become exhausted. As long as the victim of the curse is actively working to return the object, its exhaustion is reduced to fatigue. The fatigue and exhaustion cannot be removed by effects that normally remove them, though immunity to fatigue and exhaustion protect against the conditions as normal. This curse can be ended with remove curse or by returning the item to you. You can have this spell active on one item at a time.
Sensory Amplifier		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Medium=2|Mesmerist,Psychic,Witch=3|Druid=4						SCHOOL:Divination				DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:S		RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]					SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:You open the minds of all creatures near you and enhance their sensory receptors. All living creatures other than you in the area gain a +5 bonus on Perception checks. Sighted creatures gain low-light vision, and creatures with a sense of smell gain scent. In addition, the first time each round that a creature in the area takes damage, it takes an additional 2d6 points of damage of the same type. Despite being within the area, the caster does not take this extra damage.
Subjective Reality		TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Medium,Mesmerist=5|Bard,Psychic=6|Sorcerer,Wizard=7					SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V		RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]					SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:None		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:Choose one object, creature, or force you can see within long range ((400+CASTERLEVEL*40) ft.). You alter your perceptions to become convinced the target is an illusion. For you, the target becomes transparent and does not create sound or smell. Until the spell ends, you can move through the target unimpeded and the target can move through you. The target’s nonmagical attacks cannot harm you, and the target’s magical attacks deal half damage to you. The target’s non-damaging magical abilities have a 50%% chance not to affect you, and you are immune to all its sonic, language-dependent, and scent-based attacks. However, your attacks deal no damage to the target, and your magical abilities do not affect the target at all. You or the target can affect each other normally through intermediaries. For instance, while the target would be immune to the direct effects of your earthquake spell, if the spell caused a room’s ceiling to collapse, the target would not be immune to the effects of the collapse.
