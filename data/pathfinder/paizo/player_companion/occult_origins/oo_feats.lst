Careful Reader			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PRESKILL:2,Linguistics=3,Spellcraft=3											DESCISPI:YES	DESC:Your training with the Pathfinder Society (or its rivals) has taught you proper caution and wariness when deciphering the ancient scrolls and inscriptions of fallen civilizations.				SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against written magical effects, including explosive runes, glyph of warding, illusory script, symbol of death, and similar magic, as well as against any form of curse, madness, possession, or similar effect—magical or not—that might occur from reading a book, inscription, scroll, or any other form of writing.
Chakra Mandala			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool																			DESC:Using scars, tattoos, or henna, you inscribe symbols over your chakras to help maintain your balance of kundalini.													SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:If you fail the Fortitude saving throw to maintain your awakened chakras, you take only half the normal damage.
Cranial Adjustment		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deft Hands,Trepanation																			DESC:You have learned to manually adjust the plates that make up the skull, inducing altered states in your subjects.													SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You can perform the hypnotism occult skill unlock (OA) even if you can’t use psychic magic. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity (OA) feat, you can use hypnotism one additional time per day. You can use the Sleight of Hand skill in place of Diplomacy to hypnotize a subject, but doing so requires 10 minutes of contact with the target’s skull. You can perform an adjustment that takes 1 hour to access the deeper recesses of a target’s emotional mind, either granting the target a +2 bonus or imposing a –2 penalty on the target’s saving throws against mind-affecting emotion effects for 24 hours.
Cranial Implantation		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Self-Sufficient,Trepanation		PRESKILL:1,Heal=7															DESC:You turn the science of phrenology inward, driving needles and nails into your or another’s brain to grant focus through the pathways of pain.									SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You can perform the phrenology occult skill unlock (OA), though you must use needles or similar sharp implements rather than your fingertips, dealing 1d3 points of damage to the subject. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity (OA) feat, you can use phrenology one additional time per day. In addition, you can insert needles into a creature’s brain to help center its thoughts and emotions. Doing so requires a successful Heal check (DC = 25 + the target’s Hit Dice). Creatures with implanted needles gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against spells with the emotion or fear descriptor (or similar effects), but take a –1 penalty on saving throws against spells with the electricity or pain descriptors. Implanting needles deals 1d6 points of damage to the patient, which can’t be healed by any means until the needles are removed (which requires a second successful Heal check at the same DC, or a restoration or regenerate spell). If you have implanted needles into your own cranium, you can probe them as a swift action while casting a spell, dealing an amount of damage to yourself equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The pain from this probing stimulates your powers of focus, granting you a bonus of +1d6 on any concentration check you must attempt as part of casting that spell. This damage doesn’t force you to attempt a concentration check.
Haruspicy			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=3													DESC:You observe the signs of the universe by studying how spilled blood and viscera fall, learning insights into how to best appease unseen forces.									SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:If you perform a successful coup de grace, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on skill checks attempted as part of a single occult ritual or occult skill unlock performed within the next minute. Alternatively, you can instead gain a +1 caster level bonus on a single divination or necromancy spell. The ritual or spell must begin within 1 minute of the coup de grace.
Overwhelming Phantom		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spiritualist ~ Phantom								PRECLASS:1,Spiritualist=15							DESC:Your phantom is strong-willed, allowing it to enter and dominate other creature’s minds.																SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:Three times per day, as a standard action while it is fully manifested, your phantom can attempt to enter and take control of a living creature; doing so provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature can resist this influence with a successful Will save (DC %1). A phantom can maintain this control for %2 minutes, but the victim is allowed a new saving throw each minute. This ability otherwise functions as greater possession.|10+HD/2+CHA|SpiritualistLVL
Spirit Symbiosis		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spiritualist ~ Phantom												PRESPELL:1,Speak with Dead			DESC:Your phantom is impressionable and easily influenced by contact with new spirits.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:When you cast speak with dead, you can choose not to gain any of the normal effects of the spell, instead temporarily merging the summoned spirit into your phantom, exchanging your phantom’s current emotional focus and all related abilities for a new emotional focus of your choice. This new emotional focus persists for 10 minutes per class level you have, after which your phantom’s original emotional focus returns.
Rhabdomancy			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (nature)=3,Survival=3												DESC:You have mastered the art of casting sticks, rods, or arrows to uncover secrets and find lost things, gaining insight from the way these objects fall.

If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity (OA) feat, you can use dowsing one additional time per day. Spending 1 minute casting sticks prior to attempting a Survival check grants you a +2 insight bonus on the check. In addition, you can cast sticks or rods while casting a spell that locates a creature or object (including scrying effects) to increase the caster level of that spell by 1.
Ritual Hex			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Shaman ~ Hex,Witch ~ Hex	PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (arcana)=4,Knowledge (history)=4											DESC:You are well versed in ancient secrets and forbidden curses, and know how to petition powers with which you are already in contact for additional knowledge.							SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You learn to perform a special occult ritual (Occult Adventures 208) known as Beseeching the Patron, which temporarily grants you a hex you don’t already know how to use. You always believe that your ritual is a success, so the GM should roll the required skill checks in secret, revealing the result only when you try to use your newly acquired hex.
Spectrum Sight			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Alertness				PRESKILL:1,Perception=5															DESC:Your pursuit of dispassionate perfection gives you unmatched insight into the condition of others.															SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You can perform the read aura occult skill unlock (OA) even if you can’t use psychic magic. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity (OA) feat, you can use read aura one additional time per day. Once per day, you can perform an aura reading as a full-round action. If you successfully use detect thoughts or a similar mind-reading divination on a creature, you can use the read aura skill unlock on that creature as a full-round action as long as it is in your line of sight and within 30 feet. If you fail the check, you can’t attempt to read that same creature’s aura for 24 hours. [Special] If you have a ki pool, you can expend 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action to gain one additional daily use of the read aura occult skill unlock.
Trepanation			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PRESKILL:2,Heal=5,Knowledge (arcana)=2													DESC:Through careful study and practice, you have learned how to relieve pressure in the brain to balance the humors, promote health, and ward off outside influence.							SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You can perform the faith healing occult skill unlock (OA) even if you can’t use psychic magic. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity (OA) feat, you can use faith healing one additional time per day. So long as you have a healer’s kit or surgeon’s tools, you can spend 1 hour performing a full trepanation on a creature. This procedure requires a Heal check (DC = 20 + the target’s Hit Dice). If you’re successful, the target gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against curses, possession, and spells from the enchantment (compulsion) school. These effects persist for %1 days. If you fail the check, the target takes 1d3 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. You can perform this procedure on yourself, but the DC increases by 5.|TL
Truth in Wine			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PRESKILL:1,Appraise=3															DESC:In refining your palate and experiencing the food, drink, and meal rituals of myriad cultures, you have learned to divine truths about human behavior and use intoxication to break down psychological barriers.	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You can perform the psychometry occult skill unlock (OA) even if you can’t use psychic magic, though you must consume a drink of high-quality alcohol (costing at least 10 gp per drink) to do so. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity (OA) feat, you can use psychometry one additional time per day. If you consume a drink of high-quality alcohol, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks for 1 minute and can increase the caster level of the next divination spell you cast within 1 minute by 1. If you are addicted to alcohol, as described on page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide, these bonuses increase by 1, but so too does the save DC for your addiction.

Deific Obedience		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												PREDEITY:1,Y																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=3									PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks, must worship a deity.																													DESC:Your reverence for a deity is so great that daily prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons.						SOURCEPAGE:p.210	BENEFIT:Each deity requires a different daily obedience, but all obediences take no more than 1 hour per day to perform. Once you've performed the obedience, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the "Obedience" entry for the god to whom you performed the obedience. If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your deity upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the deity's second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the deity's third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon's effects are constant. Certain prestige classes (see page i98) gain access to these boons at lower levels as a benefit of their prestige class. If you have no levels in one of these prestige classes, you gain the boons marked as exalted boons. If you later take levels in sentinel or evangelist, you lose access to the exalted boons and gain access to the new boons appropriate to your class. If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience.
