BENEFIT: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or effects originating from demon worshipers and from creatures of the demon type. Goal: Convince the leader of a demon cult to renounce her Abyssal lord and seek atonement for her actions.

Completion Benefit: When a demon damages you with an attack, spell, spell-like ability, or special ability and reduces you to fewer than O hit points, you may allow righteous energy to pour through you and into the demon, instantly sending it to another plane of existence (as dismissal) if it fails a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). This dismissal takes place after you are damaged but before you fall unconscious, so you can use this ability even if the demon kills you. You can use this ability once per day. Once you have used this ability, you must be healed to your maximum number of hit points before you can use the ability again.
