# ==============================

Healing Solution					KEY:Thuvian Alchemist ~ Healing Solution					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thuvian Alchemist Class Feature.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:A Thuvian alchemist learns how to convert magical reagents into life-giving admixtures. As a full-round action, she can convert the magical energies of two extracts or spells of 1st level into a special extract of cure light wounds. This acts as an infused extract, but it must be used before the end of her next turn or its power is lost. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Thuvian alchemist gains the ability to convert extracts or spells into more powerful forms of curative magic: 3rd-cure moderate wounds; 5th-cure serious wounds; 7th-cure critical wounds; 9th-breath of life. In all cases, the Thuvian alchemist must expend two extracts or spells of the same level as the curative spell in order to complete the conversion.
Thuvian Discovery					KEY:Thuvian Alchemist ~ Thuvian Discovery					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thuvian Alchemist Class Feature.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 2nd level and again at 4th, 6th, and 8th level, a Thuvian alchemist gains a new alchemist discovery from one of the rare Thuvian discoveries.

Curative Enhancement				KEY:Thuvian Alchemist ~ Curative Enhancement				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thuvian Alchemist Class Feature.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Thuvian alchemist can select one curative enhancement. Whenever the Thuvian alchemist creates a healing solution by expending two extracts or spells, she may reduce the amount of hit point damage cured by one step (reducing a healing solution of cure moderate wounds to one of cure light wounds, for instance) in order to apply any number of her curative enhancements to her healing solution. These enhancements can remove conditions caused by curses, diseases, or poisons even if they do not remove the underlying affliction itself; the conditions return after 1 hour unless the curative enhancement actually removes the affliction that causes the condition. Once chosen, a curative enhancement cannot be changed, but the Thuvian alchemist can choose which enhancements (if any) she incorporates each time she prepares a healing solution.
