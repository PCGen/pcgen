At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Thuvian alchemist gains the ability to convert extracts or spells into more powerful forms of curative magic: 3rd-cure moderate wounds; 5th-cure serious wounds; 7th-cure critical wounds; 9th-breath of life. In all cases, the Thuvian alchemist must expend two extracts or spells of the same level as the curative spell in order to complete the conversion.

Whenever the Thuvian alchemist creates a healing solution by expending two extracts or spells, she may reduce the amount of hit point damage cured by one step (reducing a healing solution of cure moderate wounds to one of cure light wounds, for instance) in order to apply any number of her curative enhancements to her healing solution. These enhancements can remove conditions caused by curses, diseases, or poisons even if they do not remove the underlying affliction itself; the conditions return after 1 hour unless the curative enhancement actually removes the affliction that causes the condition. Once chosen, a curative enhancement cannot be changed, but the Thuvian alchemist can choose which enhancements (if any) she incorporates each time she prepares a healing solution.
