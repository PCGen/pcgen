# ==============================

Betrayed		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:You must have had a valuable item (worth at least 1,000 gp per character level) stolen by a former ally, have been left for dead by a former ally, or have the Wrong Enemy background.											DESC:Believing in a just cause left you with a knife in your back. Now you hoard your trust in others, rarely sharing it.							SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:When you are in a harmful area of effect created by an ally (through a spell or other means), you can roll your saving throw twice and take the better result. If you do so, your shaken trust means you do not provide flanking bonuses to any allies for 1 hour. [Goal] Track down the people who betrayed you, and either bring them to justice or slay them. At the GM’s discretion, certain members of this group can be spared if they provide important information leading to more prominent targets. [Completion Benefit] You grow more confident in reading others, if not exactly more trusting of them. Your allies and enemies no longer provide cover bonuses on attacks you make against other creatures. You also gain a 20%% miss chance against any attacks of opportunity made against you, as long as an ally is threatening the creature making the attack.
Cursed Love		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:You must have a romantic interest who has fallen to some dark influence and rejects you out of shame or fear of newfound capabilities, or must have the Bad Romance or Temptation background.										DESC:Your love forces you to endure the harshest of endeavors, despite the fact that most people would view your romance as madness.						SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:You are well versed in a dark society’s way of thinking and in weathering abuse. Select a form of corruption that your lover fell to or willingly embraced: evil divine casters, evil arcane casters, undead creatures, or humanoid creatures with the shapeshifter subtype. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks when dealing with such creatures, and a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist any effects that would spread their corruption to you (such as a vampire’s create spawn ability or a werewolf’s curse of lycanthropy). Once per day, when you would normally be reduced below 0 hit points by an attack from such a creature, you instead immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half your character level. [Goal] Find a way to be with your lover in a permanent fashion, either by persuading your lover to reject the influence of evil or by willingly embracing the same corruption. [Completion Benefit] You no longer suffer abuse from those with whom your lover associates, and instead command a measure of their respect. You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks against members of your chosen form of corruption. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. When you would normally be reduced below 0 hit points by an attack from such a source, you instead immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level.
Dead Inside		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:You must have failed your saving throws against at least five different emotion-manipulating spells or your saving throw against a supernatural creature’s fear effect (such as a dragon’s frightful presence), or you have the Sunless or Sole Survivor background.	DESC:You are devoid of both hatred and joy. While many regard you as callous, you have no particular malice in your heart.							SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:When you are the target of a spell or spell-like ability with the emotion or fear descriptor, you can roll your saving throw twice and take the better result. [Goal] You overcome your detached state by taking part in an important emotional event, such as finding true love or taking great pleasure in an act of unrepentant evil. Alternatively, you divest yourself of all emotion by severing your remaining emotional ties and eventually changing your alignment to neutral. [Completion Benefit] You master your emotions. You can ignore any morale bonuses or penalties applied to you by outside forces, though other emotion-based effects (such as the shaken condition or an elixir of love) still affect you if you fail a saving throw against them.
Gruesome Butcher	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:You must have been rendered unconscious and left for dead on a battlefield between warring factions or have the Child Soldier or Drafted background.															DESC:You dedicated yourself to the cause of slaughter against a specific group or people, either for country, for vengeance, or perhaps just for sport.				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:Select a particular nation, organization, or humanoid subtype (such as Cheliax, Eagle Knights, or goblinoids). You gain a +4 bonus on Sense Motive checks to determine whether a given creature is affiliated with that group and a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to conceal your animosity toward members of that group. [Goal] Deliver the killing blow to a number of your hated foes whose combined Hit Dice total is equal to 10 × your current character level. [Completion Benefit] You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against foes of your selected type, and a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. These bonuses stack with a ranger’s favored enemy bonuses. [Special] By meeting the goal of this feat, your name becomes known to your enemy.

Otherworldy Influence	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:You must have refused an evil creature with at least 15 Hit Dice who offered gifts or assistance, have refused an evil creature offering to cast a spell of 7th-level or higher on your behalf, or have the Planar Offering background.					DESC:Extradimensional forces vie for your soul, and have offered you riches and power to claim it.										SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:When negotiating with evil outsiders, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. You gain an amount of spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level against spells and spell-like abilities originating from outsiders with the evil subtype. [Goal] Receive a boon from an evil creature that is equivalent in value to a month’s service or an 8th-level spell without becoming indebted to the creature or giving up anything in return. This cannot be the result of magical compulsion. [Completion Benefit] You gain an amount of spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level against spells or spell-like abilities originating from outsiders.
Overachiever		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:You must have been defeated by the same individual, organization, or creature type at least four times, or have the Boarding School or Humiliated background.														DESC:Others made you feel small for too long, and now you drive yourself hard and never settle for second place.								SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:You take only half the normal penalties from exhaustion. Choose one skill upon selecting this feat. Once per day, you can forgo rest to study or practice, gaining a +3 bonus on all checks attempted with your selected skill for 24 hours but becoming fatigued in the process. If you rest to recover from this fatigue, this bonus ends (but not if you recover from your fatigue in other ways, such as via lesser restoration). Forgoing rest for this purpose does not interfere with a spellcaster’s ability to prepare spells. [Goal] You must utterly humiliate a member of your hated group by besting that creature at an activity for which it is known or in which it takes pride. This opponent’s Hit Dice must exceed your current character level by at least 1. [Completion Benefit] Each time you forgo rest to study or practice, you can apply this feat’s +3 bonus to a different skill. If you have 10 or more ranks in the skill selected, this bonus increases to +6.
Wretched Curator	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:You must have purchased a scroll or spellbook containing a spell with the evil descriptor in a place where such dealings are illegal, or must have the Secret Society Inductee or Diabolical Upbringing background.							DESC:Some fools fear the written word, but you that understand knowledge—all knowledge —is a valuable tool, and restricting it out of superstition is abominable in your eyes.	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:You can always purchase potions and scrolls of spells with the evil descriptor at a 10%% discount, even if they are not normally available in a settlement because of its size or the local laws. You gain a +4 bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks related to spells with the evil descriptor or evil written works. [Goal] You must own scrolls of spells with the evil descriptor or tomes of forbidden lore worth a total of 50 gp per character level, and be the primary caster of a successful occult ritual (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 208) of at least 5th level that has the evil descriptor. [Completion Benefit] Every time you cast a spell with the evil descriptor, you can remove that descriptor from the spell and treat yourself as a neutral-aligned caster for the purpose of determining the spell’s effects, circumventing defenses such as protection from evil and preventing detection via detect evil and similar effects. If you cast a spell with the evil descriptor and do not remove that descriptor, you instead gain 2 temporary hit points per spell level. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
