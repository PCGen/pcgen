DESC:Believing in a just cause left you with a knife in your back. Now you hoard your trust in others, rarely sharing it.										SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:When you are in a harmful area of effect created by an ally (through a spell or other means), you can roll your saving throw twice and take the better result. If you do so, your shaken trust means you do not provide flanking bonuses to any allies for 1 hour. [Goal] Track down the people who betrayed you, and either bring them to justice or slay them. At the GM’s discretion, certain members of this group can be spared if they provide important information leading to more prominent targets. [Completion Benefit] You grow more confident in reading others, if not exactly more trusting of them. Your allies and enemies no longer provide cover bonuses on attacks you make against other creatures. You also gain a 20%% miss chance against any attacks of opportunity made against you, as long as an ally is threatening the creature making the attack.
Cursed Love							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story																								PRETEXT:You must have a romantic interest who has fallen to some dark influence and rejects you out of shame or fear of newfound capabilities, or must have the Bad Romance or Temptation background.

SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:You are well versed in a dark society’s way of thinking and in weathering abuse. Select a form of corruption that your lover fell to or willingly embraced: evil divine casters, evil arcane casters, undead creatures, or humanoid creatures with the shapeshifter subtype.

Once per day, when you would normally be reduced below 0 hit points by an attack from such a creature, you instead immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half your character level. [Goal] Find a way to be with your lover in a permanent fashion, either by persuading your lover to reject the influence of evil or by willingly embracing the same corruption. [Completion Benefit] You no longer suffer abuse from those with whom your lover associates, and instead command a measure of their respect. You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks against members of your chosen form of corruption. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. When you would normally be reduced below 0 hit points by an attack from such a source, you instead immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level.

Alternatively, you divest yourself of all emotion by severing your remaining emotional ties and eventually changing your alignment to neutral. [Completion Benefit] You master your emotions.

You gain a +4 bonus on Sense Motive checks to determine whether a given creature is affiliated with that group and a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to conceal your animosity toward members of that group. [Goal] Deliver the killing blow to a number of your hated foes whose combined Hit Dice total is equal to 10 × your current character level. [Completion Benefit] You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against foes of your selected type, and a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them.

You gain an amount of spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level against spells and spell-like abilities originating from outsiders with the evil subtype.

Forgoing rest for this purpose does not interfere with a spellcaster’s ability to prepare spells. [Goal] You must utterly humiliate a member of your hated group by besting that creature at an activity for which it is known or in which it takes pride. This opponent’s Hit Dice must exceed your current character level by at least 1.

You gain a +4 bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks related to spells with the evil descriptor or evil written works.

If you cast a spell with the evil descriptor and do not remove that descriptor, you instead gain 2 temporary hit points per spell level. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
