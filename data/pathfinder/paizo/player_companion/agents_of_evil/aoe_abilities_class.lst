Code of Conduct			KEY:Insinuator ~ Code of Conduct		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:An insinuator must always work toward his own self-interest, enrichment, or glory, and must also abide by the moral strictures of whatever outsider they have chosen to invoke that day (see invocation below). If the insinuator breaks an invoked outsider’s code, he cannot invoke outsiders of that same alignment until he seeks atonement, although outsiders of other alignments may still heed his call.
Invocation			KEY:Insinuator ~ Invocation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																		SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:At the start of each day, an insinuator can meditate for 10 minutes to contact and barter with an outsider to empower him for a day. An insinuator can freely invoke an outsider of his own alignment. He can instead invoke an outsider within one step of his own alignment by succeeding at a Diplomacy or Knowledge (religion) skill check (DC %1). While invoking the power of an outsider, the insinuator radiates an alignment aura that matches that of the outsider’s, and becomes vulnerable to alignment-based effects that target that outsider’s alignment (such as smite evil or chaos hammer). None of an insinuator’s supernatural or spell-like class abilities function unless he has invoked the power of an outsider, and the alignment of the being invoked may affect how some abilities function.|15+AntipaladinLVL
Detect Balance			KEY:Insinuator ~ Detect Balance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																			SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:At will, an insinuator can detect strong moral leanings. This functions as detect evil or detect good, but does not actually reveal the target’s alignment, only whether the target is neutral (rather than good or evil) and the relative strength of that aura. This ability alters detect good.
Smite Impudence			KEY:Insinuator ~ Smite Impudence		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural																		SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:%1 times per day, an insinuator can beseech the forces empowering him to punish their shared enemies. As a swift action, the insinuator chooses one target within sight to smite. An insinuator cannot use smite against a target that shares an alignment with the outsider he has invoked for the day. The insinuator adds %2 on his attack rolls and %3 on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target is an outsider, dragon, or divine spellcaster with an alignment opposed to that of the outsider he has invoked for the day, the bonus damage on the first successful attack increases to %4 points of damage. Regardless of the target, the smite attack automatically bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. In addition, each time the insinuator declares a smite, he gains %4 temporary hit points. The smite effect remains until the target is defeated or the next time the insinuator rests and regains his uses of this ability.|SmiteImpudenceTimes|SmiteImpudenceAttackBonus|SmiteImpudenceDamageBonus|SmiteImpudenceLVL	DEFINE:SmiteImpudenceTimes|0	DEFINE:SmiteImpudenceAttackBonus|0	DEFINE:SmiteImpudenceDamageBonus|0	DEFINE:SmiteImpudenceLVL|0	BONUS:VAR|SmiteImpudenceTimes|min((SmiteImpudenceLVL+2)/3,7)	BONUS:VAR|SmiteImpudenceAttackBonus|max(CHA,0)	BONUS:VAR|SmiteImpudenceDamageBonus|SmiteImpudenceLVL/2	BONUS:VAR|SmiteImpudenceLVL|AntipaladinLVL	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|SmiteImpudenceTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per day
Selfish Healing			KEY:Insinuator ~ Selfish Healing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:An insinuator can heal his wounds by touch. This is treated exactly like the paladin’s lay on hands class feature, except it can be used only to heal the insinuator and cannot be used on other creatures. He can heal %1d6 hit points of damage %2 times per day.|SelfishHealingDice|SelfishHealingTimes			DEFINE:SelfishHealingTimes|0	DEFINE:SelfishHealingDice|0	DEFINE:SelfishHealingLVL|0	BONUS:VAR|SelfishHealingDice|SelfishHealingLVL/2	BONUS:VAR|SelfishHealingTimes|(SelfishHealingLVL/2)+CHA		BONUS:VAR|SelfishHealingLVL|AntipaladinLVL	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|SelfishHealingTimes
Aura of Ego			KEY:Insinuator ~ Aura of Ego			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator radiates an aura that bolsters allies and deters enemies. Each ally within 10 feet gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. Enemies within 10 feet take a –2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.
Stubborn Health			KEY:Insinuator ~ Stubborn Health		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator takes only half damage from diseases and poisons, and none of his ability scores can be reduced below 1 by these effects.
Greeds				KEY:Insinuator ~ Greeds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator can heal himself of certain conditions. This functions as the mercy paladin class ability, but these mercies can only be applied to the insinuator himself.

Channel Energy			KEY:Insinuator ~ Channel Energy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator can channel negative energy, treating his antipaladin level as his effective cleric level. If he invokes a neutral outsider for the day, he may instead chose during the invocation to channel positive energy, but treats his effective cleric level as half his antipaladin level. Using this ability consumes two uses of his selfish healing ability. This is a Charisma-based ability. This ability alters channel negative energy.
Bonus Feats			KEY:Insinuator ~ Bonus Feats			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:At 4th level, an insinuator gains one bonus feat, which must be selected from the list of combat feats or Skill Focus. At 7th level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, the insinuator gains one additional combat or Skill Focus feat.		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Insinuator Bonus Feat|(AntipaladinLVL-1)/3
Ambitious Bond			KEY:Insinuator ~ Ambitious Bond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																			SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator gains a divine bond with either a bonded weapon or an outsider servant. This functions as the antipaladin’s fiendish boon with certain modifications.

Aura of Ambition		KEY:Insinuator ~ Aura of Ambition		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:Enemies within 10 feet of an insinuator take a –1 penalty on all saving throws. All allies within 10 feet gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of the crusader. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.
Aura of Glory			KEY:Insinuator ~ Aura of Glory			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator can expend two uses of his smite impudence ability to grant the ability to smite impudence to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite impudence ability before the start of the insinuator’s next turn, and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action.
Aura of Belief			KEY:Insinuator ~ Aura of Belief			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator’s weapons are treated as chaos-aligned while he invokes a chaotic outsider, law-aligned when he invokes a lawful outsider, or evil-aligned while he invokes an evil outsider. If he invokes an outsider with more than one alignment aura, the insinuator must choose during the initial invocation which alignment his weapon radiates.
Aura of Indomitability		KEY:Insinuator ~ Aura of Indomitability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator gains DR 10 that is bypassed by the alignment opposite of the outsider he has invoked for the day, or DR 5/ while invoking a neutral outsider.
Personal Champion		KEY:Insinuator ~ Personal Champion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator becomes a living embodiment of his selfish desires. His damage resistance from aura of indomitability increases to 15 (or 10 while invoking a neutral outsider). Whenever he uses smite impudence, he adds twice his full Charisma bonus to the attack roll and doubles his effective bonus damage gained from the smite. In addition, he can invoke a new outsider patron by meditating for 10 minutes.		BONUS:VAR|SmiteImpudenceAttackBonus|max(CHA,0)	BONUS:VAR|SmiteImpudenceDamageBonus|SmiteImpudenceLVL/2
Ex-Insinuators			KEY:Insinuator ~ Ex-Insinuators			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:An insinuator who willfully commits selfless acts or engages in violence that doesn’t further his own ends loses all class features (including his outsider servant, but not bonus feats or weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He can’t progress any further in levels as an insinuator. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his faltering ambition (see the atonement spell). If he violates the code of conduct of his invoked outsider patron, he must similarly seek atonement from outsiders of that alignment again.

Bonded Weapon			KEY:Insinuator ~ Bonded Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the first special ability added to a weapon must correspond to the alignment of the outsider the insinuator has invoked for that day: anarchic (chaos), axiomatic (law), or unholy (evil). Additional special abilities may be applied if any equivalent bonus remains.
Outsider Servant		KEY:Insinuator ~ Outsider Servant		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.InsinuatorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the insinuator gains a new outsider servant each day, whose alignment must match the alignment of the outsider invoked for the day. The outsider servant functions as much as an agent for the patron invoked by the insinuator as an ally of the insinuator himself, and may turn against him if he violates his patron’s alignment or interests.

Channel Utility			KEY:Appeaser ~ Channel Utility			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.AppeaserClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																			SOURCEPAGE:p.15		DESC:An appeaser channels negative energy, but also gains limited access to positive energy. At 5th level, an appeaser can channel positive energy as a full-round action, but he treats his cleric level as if it were 4 lower when determining the amount of damage he can deal to undead and the amount of hit points he can restore to living creatures.

Mollified Domain		KEY:Appeaser ~ Mollified Domain			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.AppeaserClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																			SOURCEPAGE:p.15		DESC:An appeaser gains no domain or domain bonus spells. %1 times per day as a standard action, he can sacrifice his own force of will to gain divine providence. Doing so deals 1d3 points of Charisma damage to the appeaser, and allows him to select a single domain offered by his deity (except the Evil domain or its subdomains). The appeaser gains access to any granted powers offered by the domain he would otherwise qualify for, and can sacrifice a prepared spell to cast a domain spell from that domain just as if he were spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell. He retains access to this domain for %1 minutes. Any domain abilities that can be used a limited number of times per day can be used only once each time that particular domain is invoked.
