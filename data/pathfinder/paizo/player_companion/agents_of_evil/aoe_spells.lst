Blood Tentacles			TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Antipaladin,Summoner=4|Cleric,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5			SCHOOL:Necromancy								CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds							SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.30			DESC:You smear a handful of your own blood across your chest, causing (CASTERLEVEL) writhing tentacles to burst forth. You can direct these tentacles to attack a single creature within 15 feet as a standard action, or one creature per 5 caster levels as a full-round action. Each tentacle has an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus plus either your Constitution or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher). Each tentacle deals 2d6 points of damage, and a tentacle collapses into dried blood on a successful hit, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. You can’t gain more temporary hit points than your maximum number of hit points. These temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour. [Material Components] a fresh handful of the caster’s blood
Caustic Safeguard		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Alchemist,Bloodrager,Magus=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=4					SCHOOL:Abjuration				DESCRIPTOR:Acid			CASTTIME:1 round		COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Object touched						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]						SAVEINFO:Reflex half (see text)					SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.30			DESC:You imbue a single object with an acidic protective ward. Any creature other than you that touches the object takes min(10,CASTERLEVEL/2)d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half). Each time the spell discharges, the number of damage dice it deals is halved (rounded down); when the spell’s damage dice reach 0, the spell ends. While casting this spell, you can touch up to (CASTERLEVEL/4) creatures, which allows them to handle the warded object without triggering this spell. [Material Components] a thin metal wire and a vial of acid
Coward's Cowl			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Cleric,Mesmerist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Enchantment				DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes							SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.30			DESC:You imbue the target with a compulsion to avoid threats, enhancing its defensive instincts. So long as the affected creature does not move closer to enemies during its turn, or moves at least 5 feet away from adjacent enemies, it gains a +1 morale bonus to its AC, and a +1 morale bonus on saves and on attack rolls made as readied actions and attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, if the affected creature does not close with its enemies, it can increase the DC of all spells it casts as part of a readied action by 1. If the subject of the spell willingly moves toward a threatening creature, the spell immediately ends. While affected by coward’s cowl, a creature takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws against fear effects.
Detect Fiendish Presence	TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=0					SCHOOL:Divination								CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:60 ft.	TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped emanation					DURATION:Concentration, up to (10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]			SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that it detects only outsiders with the evil subtype, as well as the lingering effects caused by their gifts, presence, and spells. It can also detect clerics and paladins of fiendish deities, including Asmodeus, archdevils, daemonic harbingers, and demon lords.
Devil Snare			TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Cleric=4|Sorcerer,Wizard=5							SCHOOL:Abjuration				DESCRIPTOR:Good			CASTTIME:1 full-round action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius circle						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds							SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text					SPELLRES:Yes; see text	SOURCEPAGE:p.17			DESC:Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within. Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of extradimensional travel (as per dimensional anchor). Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells, and spell-like abilities. Despite the spell’s name, devil snare captures outsiders of any type, not only devils. As a standard action, you can dismiss the circle, expelling any outsiders still trapped within to their planes of origin (as per dismissal). An outsider can resist this effect with a successful Will save, enabling it to remain after the spell is dismissed. [Material Components] a pouch of silvered powder worth 25 gp
Dream Dalliance			TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Mesmerist=3|Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=4						SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 round		COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature							DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will disbelief, then Will partial (see text)		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.30			DESC:You create a comforting phantasm, which leeches onto the psyche of a nearby target. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the phantasm from entering its psyche, but otherwise it takes up permanent residence in the creature’s mind. The phantasm fills its target’s dreams with happy visions, comforting manifestations of loved ones, and incredible vistas, feeding the target a perfect fantasy life it never wishes to leave. After the target’s next night’s sleep, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw to wake up; otherwise, it remains asleep for the rest of the day and following night. Each night it must succeed at a new saving throw or remain asleep for days or weeks on end as it slowly starves to death (presuming it normally needs to eat to survive). Loud noises, jostling, and even pain won’t rouse the slumbering target. Dealing 1 point of damage per the target’s Hit Die awakens the target, but it awakens fatigued and takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws against spells and effects that may put it back to sleep until the phantasm has been banished. The phantasm remains in its host’s mind indefinitely, requiring a new Will saving throw to wake up every time the target rests, until it is removed via break enchantment, greater restoration, or miracle. Alternatively, the phantasm can be confronted in its host’s mindscape (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 202), where it manifests as a slothful duplicate of its host with identical abilities, skills, and attributes.
Enticing Adulation		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=3|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Enchantment				DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature							DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.30			DESC:A targeted creature that fails its saving throw is filled with a deep desire to protect and care for you, fawning over your needs and ensuring your comfort. If another creature harms you, the target is immediately overcome with rage and is compelled to attack the aggressor, gaining a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to its Armor Class. These bonuses last until the instigating creature is defeated or retreats, or the target of the spell is killed or rendered unconscious. If other creatures have harmed you while the target is under this effect, the target continues to rage until all threats against you are defeated or driven off, after which the target creature is fatigued for as many rounds as it raged. Your target continues to fly into defensive rages each time a creature harms you so long as the spell’s duration lasts, but cannot rage while fatigued. If you are reduced below 0 hit points by an attack, the target creature must succeed at a second Will save or be compelled to defend your body, attacking anyone who comes near, for the remainder of the spell’s duration. If the creature succeeds at this second save, the spell immediately ends. [Material Components] a lock of your hair
Furious Fire Barrage		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bloodrager=4|Magus=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=6						SCHOOL:Evocation				DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds; see text						SAVEINFO:Reflex half						SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.31			DESC:Upon casting this spell, you conjure forth one or two balls of flame, each resting in a free hand. As part of casting this spell or as a standard action, you can throw one flame ball a maximum of 300 feet, dealing min(10,CASTERLEVEL)d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius spread. So long as the spell’s duration lasts, you can channel your anger as a full-round action to create one new ball of flame, which can be thrown as a standard action. You cannot create additional balls of flame while you are under the effects of a calm emotions spell or are otherwise unable to feel anger or outrage. [Material Components] two balls of guano
Golden Guise			TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=2|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Transmutation								CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One object weighing no more than (5*CASTERLEVEL) lbs.	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes							SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.31			DESC:You cause an object to briefly transform into gold. Affected items gain the properties of gold (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 53) until the spell expires. Weapons reduce their hardness by half and gain the fragile quality, while piercing and slashing weapons take a –2 penalty on damage rolls (minimum 1 damage). This spell increases the affected item’s armor check penalty by 2 and decreases its armor or shield bonus by 2. Gold armor has hardness 5. [Material Components] 10 gold pieces
Punishing Armor			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bloodrager,Magus,Shaman,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Summoner,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Abjuration								CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates; see below				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.19			DESC:You coat yourself with a thin layer of shimmering energy. Any creature dealing nonlethal damage to you immediately takes half the amount of nonlethal damage dealt. A successful Fortitude save made by the attacking creature negates this damage.
Shadow Endurance		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist,Shaman,Spiritualist=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=6				SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow	DESCRIPTOR:Shadow		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours until discharged, then (CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with); varies; see text	SPELLRES:See text	SOURCEPAGE:p.31			DESC:You conjure protective wisps of darkness made from shadow. If you are reduced below 0 hit points or rendered unconscious, shadow endurance immediately discharges, shunting your injured body into a hidden alcove on the Shadow Plane. You immediately stabilize, but cannot awaken or take any further actions until the second duration expires. As you vanish, a quasi-real duplicate of you made from shadow substance appears where you fell, as if created by shadow conjuration. The duplicate acts on your initiative and is under your control. Your duplicate is 1/4 as real as you and appears with 25%% of your full hit point total, and any creature that fails a Will saving throw believes it to be you. The duplicate has the same equipment-based bonuses as you, but deals only 1/4 of your normal damage against enemies. It can cast any spells you can, drawing on your reserve of magic, but the duplicate’s caster level is 1/4 your actual level. Regardless of your alignment, your shadow duplicate is neutral evil, though it will not harm your friends and allies. When the second duration of the spell expires, your duplicate disappears and your body reappears in the location from which you vanished. If the image is destroyed, the spell immediately expires and your body reappears. [Material Components] a fetchling’s tooth
Unholy Ward			TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Antipaladin,Inquisitor=3|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=4				SCHOOL:Abjuration				DESCRIPTOR:Evil			CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,DF	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]						SAVEINFO:Negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.19			DESC:This spell grants you resistance to the holy powers of good-aligned deities and their servants. You resist 10 points of damage from holy sources (divine power damage from flame strike, additional damage from smite evil, channeled positive energy, etc.), provided they originate from a good-aligned source or a servant of a good-aligned god. You ignore a maximum of (10*CASTERLEVEL) points of damage, at which point the spell ends.
