###Block: New Arrows
# Equipment Name		Type							Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Bleeding Arrow		TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:360	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	SPROP:This sharpened hollow tube looks like it was originally a narrow proboscis on some giant insect, but it actually comes from a strange carnivorous plant. A bleeding arrow deals normal damage when it hits a creature. Each round thereafter, the creature bleeds for 1 point of damage until the bleeding is stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic. A critical hit does not multiply the bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune to the bleed damage dealt by this weapon.
Durable Arrow		TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:1	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	SPROP:These arrows are tightly wrapped in strands of some kind of alchemical glue. Durable arrows don't break due to normal use, whether or not they hit their target; unless the arrow goes missing, an archer can retrieve and reuse a durable arrow again and again. Durable arrows can be broken in other ways (such as deliberate snapping, hitting a fire elemental, and so on). If crafted with magic (such as bane), the magic only lasts for one use of the arrow, but the nonmagical arrow can still be reused or imbued with magic again.
Dye Arrow			TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:1	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	SPROP:This arrow ends in a crystalline bubble. Firing a dye arrow is a ranged touch attack; a creature struck by a dye arrow takes no damage but is splashed with black, blue, green, or red marker dye (see Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting page 213) sufficient to coat about 1 square foot.
Lodestone Arrow		TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:10	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	SPROP:This heavy iron arrowhead is sealed with an alchemical resin; pulling a small string (a move action) breaks the seal and activates the reaction in the arrowhead, greatly increasing its magnetic properties. You gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls when firing a lodestone arrow at a target wearing a significant amount of metal armor (at least chain mail or a metal shield) or made of metal, but the magnetized arrow only deals half damage. In areas with a lot of magnetic metal, the attack bonus may drop to 0 or even become a penalty as competing sources steer the arrow away from your intended target. The increased magnetism fades 1 round after you activate it, after which time it is a normal arrow.
Pheromone Arrow		TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:15	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	SPROP:The arrowhead of this arrow is coated with potent substances that react to blood and sweat, releasing strong aromas that most predators recognize as tasty injured prey and other creatures perceive as merely unpleasant. Any creature with the scent ability gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls made against a target marked with a pheromone arrow. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until the target spends 1 minute washing.
Raining Arrow		TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:30	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	SPROP:This thick-shafted arrow contains a reservoir of holy water and is designed to burst on impact, hitting the target and splashing nearby creatures as if you had thrown the vial. A raining arrow has a -2 penalty on attack rolls due to its weight.
Slow Burn Arrow		TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:150	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	SPROP:Behind the head of this arrow is a small receptacle of alchemical material that heats up when exposed to air and eventually bursts into flame; barbs on the arrowhead pierce the pouch when it hits a target. On your turn, 1 round after impact, the burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage to the target. The extra weight of this arrowhead gives you a -1 penalty on attack rolls with the arrow.
Splintercloud Arrow	TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:25	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	SPROP:The shaft of this arrow is formed of numerous small bone fragments painstakingly glued together. When fired they tear themselves apart, forming a 5-foot burst of razor-sharp bones that deals 1d3 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 18 negates).
Tangleshot Arrow		TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:20	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	SPROP:This arrow is topped with a small bottle containing a small quantity of tanglefoot goo. You fire a tangleshot arrow as a ranged touch attack; the arrow deals no damage when it hits, but the target is splashed with the alchemical adhesive. The reduced amount of the glue means this arrow is less effective than an actual tanglefoot bag (DC 10 Reflex save, DC 12 Strength check to break, 10 points of slashing damage to cut through, DC 10 Concentration check). The weight of a tangleshot arrow reduces its range increment to half normal. Elves use this to slow or stop fleeing opponents or to capture animals without killing them.
Trip Arrow			TYPE:Arrow.Resizable.Ammunition.Magic	COST:25	WT:0.15	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	SPROP:This squat arrow has a large, bulbous, metal tip that expands and flattens in flight. If the arrow hits, it initiates a trip attack against the target (DC = 15); the target falls prone if it fails its check, but if it succeed it cannot attempt to trip you in return.

###Block: - Mystical Meals
# Equipment Name			Type					Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Buttered Sparrowfish Fillet	TYPE:Mystical Meal.Magic	COST:900	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.26	SPROP:Eating the magical fillet gives you a +10 competence bonus on Balance, Climb, and Swim checks for 1 hour.
Cheya Dumplings			TYPE:Mystical Meal.Magic	COST:300	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	SPROP:A typical cheya dumpling gives you a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 hour, though other varieties may enhance other ability scores.
Leap Cake				TYPE:Mystical Meal.Magic	COST:500	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	SPROP:For the next 10 minutes, you gain a +20 bonus on Jump checks. If you deliberately jump down from a height and succeed at a DC 15 Jump check, you take falling damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than normal (rather than 10 feet shorter). If you fall, you may make a Jump check instead of a Tumble check to treat the fall as 10 feet shorter.
Newlife Soup			TYPE:Mystical Meal.Magic	COST:1500	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	SPROP:If you die within 1 hour of eating a bowl of newlife soup, you rise on your next turn, alive as if someone had cast raise dead on you, except that you do not lose a level and you have half of your normal hit points. You are alive (not undead) for 10 minutes and can be healed normally but drop dead once those 10 minutes pass. Raise dead or similar spells cannot make your temporary life permanent; to bring you back from the dead, you must be allowed to die when the soup's power ends. Each meal of newlife soup can only bring you back from the dead once.
Snowberry Fire Peppers		TYPE:Mystical Meal.Magic	COST:600	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	SPROP:You gain fire resistance 10 for 1 hour. Any time this effect negates 10 or more points of fire damage, you must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15 + fire damage taken) or be dazed for 1 round as the spices overwhelm your senses.
Sun-Dried Lantern Lemons	TYPE:Mystical Meal.Magic	COST:900	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	SPROP:After eating a handful of sun-dried lantern lemons you glow as brightly as a daylight spell for 1 hour. The light shines out of your skin, and while you can cover yourself to block the light and reduce its effect to that of a light spell or even a candle, only magical darkness or complete enshrouding (such as wrapping yourself from head to toe in layers of cloth or leather) can fully block the light. Lesser forms of these treats exist that cause you to shine with a fainter light and for a shorter duration. Elven actors sometimes use these fainter variants in stage productions to represent angelic beings.
Waybread				TYPE:Mystical Meal.Magic	COST:50	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	SPROP:One is enough to keep a belly full for an entire day and slakes thirst for that period as well.

The Viridian Crown	NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Headgear.Helm.Magic	WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.31	SPROP:At will you may use detect poison, heal, light, or break enchantment as a standard action. Once per day you may use heroes' feast and resurrection. If you are the properly anointed ruler of the Kyonin elves, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. You may use scrying at will on any of your subjects (any elf who acknowledges your authority as the elven monarch). You and any subjects within 60 feet gain the benefits of a good hope spell at all times. Three times per day while within Kyonin you may create a guards and wards effect.
