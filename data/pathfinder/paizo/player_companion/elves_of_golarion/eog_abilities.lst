DESC:Honoring Your Debt: The Savored Sting scorns those who prove unable to finish a task the first time they try it. Once a particular opponent suffers damage from your sneak attack, you cannot use your sneak attack against that foe again for the remainder of the battle.

ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Pact Ability ~ Sudden Sting	NAMEISPI:YES
Desna's Starry Veil		KEY:Pact ~ Desna's Starry Veil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Pact.SpecialQuality	COST:0	PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Pact],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Pact ~ Desna's Starry Veil]		PRETEXT:Requirement: Uncanny dodge		DESC:Honoring Your Debt: Good-aligned elves and fey can sense that you are personally beholden to the Song of the Spheres, leaving them with no compunctions about calling upon your assistance when needed. The first time per day that a good elf or fey asks for your help, it acts as a suggestion spell (DC = 13 + Cha modifier of creature asking for help). If you make your saving throw, you need not carry out the request, but consistently scorning the destiny Desna has laid out for you might lead to greater problems.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Pact Ability ~ Starry Veil	NAMEISPI:YES	DESCISPI:YES
Nethys' Terrible Secret		KEY:Pact ~ Nethys' Terrible Secret		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Pact.SpecialQuality	COST:0	PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Pact],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Pact ~ Nethys' Terrible Secret]		PRETEXT:Requirement: Bardic knowledge	DESC:Honoring Your Debt: Your access to the terrible secret fully known only by the All-Seeing Eye sometimes leaves you melancholy and scattered.

If you choose to take some other action at the start of combat, you need not pause in this way, but you must always forfeit your first attack of the day once you decide to make it.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Pact Ability ~ Terrible Secret	NAMEISPI:YES	DESCISPI:YES

Whenever you attempt to make an attack roll against a living creature that has not attacked you, an ally, or an innocent in your presence, you must succeed on a DC 14 Will saving throw to avoid missing the target automatically. Once you attempt this save (whether you succeed or fail), you can act normally against that foe for the remainder of the day.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Pact Ability ~ Warm Embrace	NAMEISPI:YES	DESCISPI:YES

###Block: Pact Abilities
Sudden Sting	KEY:Pact Ability ~ Sudden Sting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:Once per day, when an opponent strikes you in melee, you can choose to make an immediate counterattack as an attack of opportunity. If you hit with this attack, you deal damage as if your opponent were flat-footed (for example, allowing you to apply sneak attack damage).
Starry Veil		KEY:Pact Ability ~ Starry Veil	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:Once per day, the first time you suffer enough damage from a weapon attack to render you unconscious or dead, a strange nimbus of swirling darkness surrounds your opponent just before he lands the blow. Your opponent must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) to avoid suffering a sudden bout of temporary blindness. Though your opponent's blindness only lasts for a moment (too brief a time for anyone to exploit it in battle), he automatically misses the attack that triggered the veil and you remain standing.
Terrible Secret	KEY:Pact Ability ~ Terrible Secret	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, you can transmit some tiny fragment of the lore that broke the mind of a god to an opponent within 30 feet. Though too horrific for a mortal mind to retain, this knowledge transcends mere language and consciousness, allowing you to make virtually any sentient creature quake in its boots. The target must make a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Cha modifier) or be nauseated for 1 round.
Warm Embrace	KEY:Pact Ability ~ Warm Embrace	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:Whenever you choose to fight defensively or use total defense, you gain a sacred bonus on saving throws equal to half of the AC bonus you gained by taking this action.
