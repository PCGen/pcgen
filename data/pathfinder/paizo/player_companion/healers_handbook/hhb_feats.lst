###Need to add a vigor pool ability for use tracking

Combat Vigor					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,13		PRETEXT:Con 13	DESC:You can quickly recuperate from devastating attacks without divine assistance.	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:You gain a vigor pool with a maximum number of points equal to your Constitution bonus. As a standard action, you can spend up to 1 vigor point per 3 Hit Dice you have (minimum 1) to regain 1d6 hit points per vigor point spent (maximum 7d6). Each time you spend vigor points, you become fatigued for 1 minute. You cannot spend vigor points while fatigued or exhausted. Spending vigor points doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The points in your vigor pool are replenished to their maximum after you rest for 8 hours.

Conditional Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic			DESC:You know how to apply restrictions on how a creature can use the benefits of your spells.																SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:A conditional spell is subject to the rules laid out in the spell conditional favor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 206). A conditional spell takes up a spell slot 1 level higher than normal.		ADDSPELLLEVEL:1

Contingent Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic			PRETEXT:Ability to cast cure spells (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).							DESC:You are able to set up healing spells in advance so that they instantly take effect at the most opportune moments, especially those that take place on the field of battle.																SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:A contingent spell infuses a target with a dormant healing or restorative spell that can trigger when the target needs it the most. This metamagic feat can be applied to only cure spells; breath of life; or any harmless spell that can be used to remove ability score damage, ability score drain, or a negative condition or effect (including break enchantment, neutralize poison, and remove disease). When you cast a contingent spell, you must set a specific trigger that dictates under what circumstances the target is immediately subject to the spell's effects (for instance, "When the target dies, breath of life takes effect"). The contingent spell's effects can remain dormant within the target for up to 10 minutes per caster level you have. A creature can be infused with only one contingent spell at a time. A contingent spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.		ADDSPELLLEVEL:2

Curative Mastery					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Item Mastery			PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=2	PRESKILL:1,Use Magic Device=1	PRETEXT:Use Magic Device 1 rank, base Fortitude bonus +2.	DESC:You can invoke a magic item's innate conjuration magic to conjure positive energy for healing wounds.	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:You can cause an item that has a 1st-level or higher conjuration spell listed in its construction requirements to cast cure light wounds as a spell-like ability, using the item's caster level as the spell's caster level. You can use this feat once per day, plus one additional time per day when your base Fortitude save bonus reaches +4, +6, +8, +10, and +12. You can expend two uses of this feat to cast cure moderate wounds, three uses to cast cure serious wounds, four uses to cast cure critical wounds, and five uses to cast breath of life, provided that the item's construction requirements include a spell whose level is equal to or greater than the level of the spell-like ability to be used (2nd level for cure moderate wounds, 3rd level for cure serious wounds, 4th level for cure critical wounds, and 5th level for breath of life).

Fortuitous Vigor					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Vigor	PRELEVEL:MIN=4	PRETEXT:Con 13, Combat Vigor, character level 4th.	DESC:Your determination and enthusiasm help you shake off the most grievous wounds and soldier on against your enemies.	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:Your vigor pool gains 1 vigor point. Whenever you roll a natural 20 on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, and whenever you threaten a critical hit with an attack, you can spend 1 or more vigor points as a swift action to regain hit points as described in the Combat Vigor feat.

Insidious Healing					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			DESC:Your determination and enthusiasm help you shake off the most grievous wounds and soldier on against your enemies.Your healing spells give you an advantage when you choose to affect those targets with other spells.	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:Any creature that chooses not to attempt a saving throw against any healing spell you cast takes a –4 penalty on saving throws against other targeted spells you cast for 24 hours.

Lifebound					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			DESC:You are especially responsive to curative magic that soothes your wounds with particular effectiveness.	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Whenever a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability heals you up to your maximum number of hit points, any excess hit points persist for 1 round per level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of hit points equal to 1/2 your character level). If the healing from the spell or spell-like ability would normally persist as temporary hit points (such as if the spell's caster were an oracle of life with the spirit boost revelation), you instead add 1/2 your character level to the spell's caster's level to determine the total number of temporary hit points that you gain. For instance, if a 4th-level oracle of life with the spirit boost revelation heals a 4th-level fighter with this feat, up to 6 points of healing could become temporary hit points for the fighter (the oracle's caster level + 1/2 the fighter's level).

Painful Cures					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE		PRETEXT:Evil alignment.		DESC:Your healing spells exacerbate rather than alleviate pain.	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:Whenever you use a spell to restore hit points to a living creature, you can cause that creature to be wracked with waves of searing pain. If you do, the spell gains the evil and pain (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 251) descriptors. The target takes nonlethal damage equal to the number of hit points restored. If the target fails its saving throw or chooses not to attempt one against your healing spell, it takes a –2 penalty on saving throws and skill checks for 10 minutes per caster level. If the spell does not normally allow a saving throw, it instead allows a Fortitude saving throw to negate this penalty (but not the nonlethal damage dealt).

Restorative Vigor					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,15	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Vigor		PRELEVEL:MIN=8	PRETEXT:Con 15, Combat Vigor, character level 8th.	DESC:You can recover from additional kinds of damage using your vigor.	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Your vigor pool gains 1 vigor point. Whenever you spend vigor points, you can recover from 1d3 points of ability score damage from one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) instead of regaining 1d6 hit points. You can choose separately for each vigor point spent. For example, if you spend 2 vigor points, you could regain 2d6 hit points; recover 2d3 points of ability damage from up to two physical ability scores total; or regain 1d6 hit points and recover from 1d3 points of ability damage from one physical ability score.


Take a Breather					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Vigor		PRELEVEL:MIN=4	PRETEXT:Con 13, Combat Vigor, character level 4th.	DESC:You can use lapses in your opponent's guard to recuperate from the wounds you have already sustained.	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Your vigor pool gains 1 vigor point. Whenever an opponent that you threaten provokes an attack of opportunity from you, as a swift action you can spend 1 or more vigor points to regain hit points as described by the Combat Vigor feat, instead of making an attack of opportunity against that opponent. Spending vigor in this manner does not count against the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make during a round.

Unconquerable Resolve					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Samurai ~ Resolve	PRECLASS:1,Samurai=1		PRETEXT:Resolve class feature, samurai level 1st.	DESC:Each time you tap into your inner strength, your bodily strength is renewed, making you much more resilient than you might look.	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Whenever you spend a daily use of the resolve class feature, you gain 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die you have. These temporary hit points are lost first when you take damage, disappear after 1 minute, and are replenished each time you use the resolve class feature. Temporary hit points gained in this way persist for 24 hours and then, if you haven't lost them, they disappear. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you take it, the number of temporary hit points you gain each time you spend a daily use of the resolve class feature increases by 1 per Hit Die you have.


Vim and Vigor					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,13	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Vigor,Endurance		PRELEVEL:MIN=3	PRETEXT:Con 13, Combat Vigor, Endurance, character level 3rd.	DESC:You rebound more quickly than normal when you draw upon your inner reserve to repair your wounds.	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Your vigor pool gains 1 vigor point. The fatigued condition that you gain from spending vigor points (as described by the Combat Vigor feat on page 14) lasts for 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. In addition, when you take this feat, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion.

Masterpiece (Endless Waltz of the Eldest)		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Masterpiece			PREVARGTEQ:MasterpieceLVL,1	PRESKILL:2,Perform (String Instruments)=4,Perform (Dance)=4				DESC:This elegant but dizzyingly fast gnome waltz calls for rapidly changing roles inspired by the many faces that the legendary Eldest of the First World wear.															SOURCEPAGE:p.19

Masterpiece (Symphony of Sylandurla's Ascent)	NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Masterpiece			PREVARGTEQ:MasterpieceLVL,1	PRESKILL:2,Perform (Percussion Instruments)=7,Perform (Wind Instruments)=7				DESC:This elaborate arrangement for traditional elven instruments evokes Sylandurla's heroic climb up the spire from the planar city of Axis to the Boneyard, where it's said that she sang 8,008 tales to win elves their immunity to magical sleep.															SOURCEPAGE:p.19
