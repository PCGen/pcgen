# Alchemist Discoveries
# ------------------------------

Neutralizing Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Neutralizing Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier			SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving throw, this bomb doesn't allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. This discovery doesn't stack with any other that modifies bombs.
Purging Mutagen			KEY:Discovery ~ Purging Mutagen		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural				SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The alchemist's mutagen combines ipecac and other purgative components. A non-alchemist who consumes the mutagen is nauseated for only 1 round, during which time her body rapidly metabolizes or expels all extant toxins, granting her an immediate second saving throw against each ongoing disease and poison currently affecting her. Each successful save counts as two consecutive successful saving throws for the purpose of curing the affliction. Any failed saving throws do not result in additional damage or other effects. A non-alchemist who consumes a second purging mutagen in a 24-hour period is instead nauseated for 1 hour. When an alchemist drinks the mutagen, he can choose whether or not to also be affected by this discovery in addition to the mutagen's other effects.
Remedy Extract			KEY:Discovery ~ Remedy Extract		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural				SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:When the alchemist creates an extract, he can add one nonmagical alchemical remedy (such as an antitoxin) to it. When the extract is consumed, both the formula and the alchemical remedy take effect. The extract has a level 1 higher than normal. This discovery cannot be combined with other methods of combining multiple consumed items or extracts into one. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.

In order to use this ability, the witch must be adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally's soul must be free and willing to return at the witch's behest. When the witch touches the creature's remains (some small portion of the creature's body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch's familiar as per familiar melding, as if the witch's familiar were the target's familiar. The creature's soul can remain within the witch's familiar for up to %1 hours. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature's soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature's soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + %2. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature's body to return it to life. If a creature's soul is in the witch's familiar and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.|WitchDeathInterruptedDuration|classlevel("Witch")		BONUS:VAR|WitchDeathInterruptedDuration|max(1,floor(classlevel("Witch")/2))		SOURCEPAGE:p.17

An ally revived in this way takes 1 point of burn + any points of burn from the kinetic healer utility wild talent (if you choose to have the ally take points of burn instead of taking it yourself). If you have the metahealer ability (such as from the kinetic chirurgeon kineticist archetype found on page 90 of Occult Adventures), this feat instead allows you to bring an ally back who died within a number of rounds equal to 3 + the ally's Constitution modifier (minimum 0) - the number of points of burn the ally had taken before it died.
