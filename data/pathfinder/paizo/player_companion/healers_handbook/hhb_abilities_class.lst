Neutralizing Bomb				KEY:Discovery ~ Neutralizing Bomb														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier																																																																																																																																																					DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving throw, this bomb doesn't allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. This discovery doesn't stack with any other that modifies bombs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Purging Mutagen				KEY:Discovery ~ Purging Mutagen														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																						DESC:The alchemist's mutagen combines ipecac and other purgative components. A non-alchemist who consumes the mutagen is nauseated for only 1 round, during which time her body rapidly metabolizes or expels all extant toxins, granting her an immediate second saving throw against each ongoing disease and poison currently affecting her. Each successful save counts as two consecutive successful saving throws for the purpose of curing the affliction. Any failed saving throws do not result in additional damage or other effects. A non-alchemist who consumes a second purging mutagen in a 24-hour period is instead nauseated for 1 hour. When an alchemist drinks the mutagen, he can choose whether or not to also be affected by this discovery in addition to the mutagen's other effects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Remedy Extract				KEY:Discovery ~ Remedy Extract														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																						DESC:When the alchemist creates an extract, he can add one nonmagical alchemical remedy (such as an antitoxin) to it. When the extract is consumed, both the formula and the alchemical remedy take effect. The extract has a level 1 higher than normal. This discovery cannot be combined with other methods of combining multiple consumed items or extracts into one. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.
