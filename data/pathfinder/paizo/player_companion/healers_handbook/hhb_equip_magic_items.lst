Gloves of Stolen Breath		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Glove.GreaterMajor		COST:54000		WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:These black leather gloves feel like warm, living skin to the touch. When the wearer delivers a coup de grace that kills an opponent, she can target a single creature within 30 feet that has died within the previous 3 rounds as a free action. The target creature is healed as if with a breath of life spell (regaining 5d8+9 hit points), and if the creature’s hit point total is then greater than a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. As with the breath of life spell, creatures brought back to life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day, but this effect can save creatures slain by death effects. This effect cannot damage undead creatures. The opponent killed by the coup de grace must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the target slain creature’s Hit Dice or the gloves’ ability is not triggered.

Healer's Satchel (Normal)		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.LesserMinor		COST:1500		WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:This well-worn physician’s bag can be slung over one shoulder or carried easily in one hand. It contains a collection of continually renewing bandages, medicines, and herbs. This acts as a healer’s kit, except spent uses are renewed every day, so the wielder can expend up to 10 uses in any 24-hour period. When the wielder expends 2 uses from a healer’s satchel to treat deadly wounds with the Heal skill, she adds her Wisdom bonus to the amount of hit points restored, and if she exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she adds 2 × her Wisdom bonus to the amount restored. The wielder also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Heal checks when she expends uses of the healer’s satchel to treat poisons and provide first aid (this does not stack with the normal +2 circumstance bonus granted for using a healer’s kit).

This also has additional enchantments and equipment to further aid in certain medical situations.

Memoriam Root		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.GreaterMinor		COST:6000		WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:This sharp wooden root looks green and alive. When plunged into the earth over a buried humanoid corpse, the root grows into a young tree in 1 hour. The appearance of the plant and the fruit it produces is a reflection of the personality the dead humanoid had in life, and the resulting tree and the buried corpse cannot be moved from the location without killing the tree. The tree produces 1d4 pieces of magical fruit each day, regardless of the local climate or weather. Each fruit provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature and restores 1 hit point when eaten. Consumed fruit also grants additional effects depending on the alignment the corpse had while alive.

Nursing Necklace (Ant)		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.LesserMedium		COST:8000		WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:This large, vermin-shaped medallion can crawl free from its setting to heal the wearer’s ills. On command, the vermin can animate to perform any function allowable by the Heal skill on the wearer only. The vermin has a +12 bonus on Heal checks for these purposes and acts as if it had unlimited uses of a healer’s kit (the circumstance bonus for using a healer’s kit is factored into the vermin’s bonus on Heal checks). Alternatively, the vermin can aid a healer working to treat the wearer. In this case, the vermin grants the healer a +10 circumstance bonus on Heal checks for this purpose. If the wearer’s hit point total is negative, the vermin automatically activates and, on the wearer’s next turn, performs first aid (even if the wearer is unconscious).

Alternatively, the vermin can aid a healer working to treat the wearer. In this case, the vermin grants the healer a +10 circumstance bonus on Heal checks for this purpose. On command, the vermin can use the Heal skill to provide long-term care for up to six creatures (which may or may not include the wearer), as long as the targets remain within 30 feet of the wearer for the duration of their rest. (This does not count as the wearer performing long-term care on herself; therefore the vermin can include her in the long-term care given.)

The vermin has a +12 bonus on Heal checks for these purposes and acts as if it had unlimited uses of a healer’s kit (the circumstance bonus for using a healer’s kit is factored into the vermin’s bonus on Heal checks). Alternatively, the vermin can aid a healer working to treat the wearer. In this case, the vermin grants the healer a +10 circumstance bonus on Heal checks for this purpose. Once per day on command, the vermin can suck impurities from the blood. This ends any ongoing poison effect if the vermin succeeds at a Heal skill check with a DC equal to the poison’s saving throw DC. On a failure, the wearer still receives a +4 competence bonus on her next saving throw against the poison.

Nursing Necklace (Spider)		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet.LesserMedium		COST:8000		WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:This large, vermin-shaped medallion can crawl free from its setting to heal the wearer’s ills.

Alternatively, the vermin can aid a healer working to treat the wearer. In this case, the vermin grants the healer a +10 circumstance bonus on Heal checks for this purpose.  Three times per day on command, the vermin can fire silk webbing over the wounds of a creature within 30 feet. This allows the vermin to attempt a Heal check to stabilize the creature or stop bleed damage at range.

Phoenix Feather		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.GreaterMinor		COST:4500		WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:This vibrant red feather is surrounded by a faint, soothing golden glow that makes it appear preternaturally shiny and pristine. As an immediate action, the user can activate the phoenix feather to attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect with the death descriptor, even if the spell or effect does not normally allow a saving throw. If the spell or effect normally allows a saving throw for reduced damage or a partial effect, the bearer suffers only the reduced damage or partial effect on a failed saving throw, and completely negates all damage and effects on a successful saving throw. If the spell or effect does not normally allow a saving throw, calculate the DC of the saving throw this item provides as if it did. Alternatively, when a single attack, spell, or effect deals hit point damage to the user that would reduce her to negative hit points, after the hit point damage is rolled but before it is applied to her, she can activate the phoenix feather as a free action. If she does, she reduces the amount of hit point damage she takes by up to 5d8 + 9 points. (She can never reduce the amount of damage taken to less than 0.) A phoenix feather is usable once, after which it immediately burns away in a fiery flash before being reduced to ash.

Ring of Resumption		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Ring.LesserMajor		COST:30800		WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:This adamantine ring contains a moving, notched golden circle that whirs with healing energy when activated. Once per day when the wearer takes hit point damage by any means, she can activate the ring as an immediate action. This immediately allows a living wearer to regain 5 hit points per round and recover from an equal amount of nonlethal damage. The wearer regenerates a total number of hit points equal only to the damage taken when the ring was activated, and only a single attack (or another single instance) can activate the ring. If the wearer sustains damage from multiple sources simultaneously, she must pick which source activates the ring. When either all of this damage is healed or the wearer’s hit points reach her hit point maximum (whichever comes first), the hit point regeneration ceases. In addition, the wearer is immune to bleed damage while the ring’s regeneration is active. If the wearer lost a limb, an organ, or any other body part as a result of the effect she used to activate the ring, the ring regenerates it as per regenerate. As with the spell, if the severed members are not present and touching the creature, this regenerate effect takes 2d10 rounds (this may cause the regenerate effect affecting a lost limb or organ to last longer than the hit point regeneration).

Silver Soul Cord		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Belt.GreaterMedium		COST:25000		WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:This shimmering metallic belt is composed of dozens of looped silver cords tied together in elaborate braids and knots. As a standard action, the wearer can touch his animal companion to attach an invisible, incorporeal cord to it that, if it can be seen by anyone, appears to be superficially tied to the silver soul cord. This forms a deeper bond between the wearer and the animal companion. It can be attached to only one animal companion at a time. If the animal companion is killed or the link is broken while the cord is attached in this manner (though very few things can destroy the incorporeal cord), the wearer and the animal companion each gain a negative level and the silver soul cord cannot be reattached to any creature for 24 hours. The cord can extend for a length of up to 1 mile, but if the attached animal companion moves farther away from the wearer than this, the cord automatically detaches and the bond ends, though it is not considered to be broken and therefore does impart any negative levels. The wearer can remove the cord as a standard action. While the silver cord is attached, the wearer gains an empathic link with an animal companion as if it were a familiar (per the wizard arcane bond class feature). Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can sacrifice his own hit points to heal the animal companion through this bond. The creature regains 1 hit point for every 1 hit point the wearer sacrifices. The wearer can sacrifice a maximum number of hit points per turn equal to his Hit Dice, and can’t sacrifice hit points if doing so would reduce him to 0 hit points or fewer.

Soothing Lyre		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Instrument.String.LesserMajor		COST:45000		WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This ornate string instrument looks as if it were crafted from gold and silver but is as light as hollow wood. When the proper chords are struck (a standard action), the bearer can target all creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst with a lullaby spell (DC 13) that lasts as long as the bearer concentrates plus up to 13 rounds. Additionally, once per day as a standard action, she can strum the lyre to affect up to nine creatures with mass cure light wounds, as per the spell. If the character has the bardic performance class feature, instead of this effect, she can perform a soothing performance once per day, even if she is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability (this still requires 4 rounds of continuous performance and still uses her bard level as the caster level). A bard who can use soothing performance and who plays the lyre as part of her performance increases her effective caster level for that ability by 1.

Trollskin Tourniquet		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.LesserMinor		COST:3850		WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This roll of flexible green leather can be easily wrapped around the stump of a severed limb (a finger, toe, hand, foot, arm, leg, tail, or even neckthough the last works only in the case of multi- headed creatures). The body part regrows over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed. While a creature wears a trollskin tourniquet, it does not need to remain entirely still. However, if it sustain an amount of hit points of damage equal to or greater than 3 × its Hit Dice, the tourniquet is jostled out of position and must be reset. This also resets the regrowth time period required; the tourniquet must remain on the stump for 24 hours from the time it was reset to regrow the limb. While a trollskin tourniquet can’t restore a dead creature to life, it can repair a corpse to make it easier to resurrect. This requires at least a partially whole decomposed or skeletonized inanimate corpse, and the tourniquet must be placed around an intact limb, the chest, or some other portion of the corpse. The corpse regenerates over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed (if the tourniquet is jostled, the regrowth time resets, as described above with regard to a living creature). At the end of this time, the corpse becomes whole and any missing parts are restored. The deceased creature is treated as having been dead for no more than 1 day for the purposes of resurrection magic. Each trollskin tourniquet is usable once.

Unicorn's Blackened Horn		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.GreaterMajor		COST:50000		WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This long ivory horn is twisted, elegant, and shining, but marring its beautiful length are black, diseased lines of corruption. This item is an intact unicorn’s horn that has been horribly tainted by evil forces. The wielder of the unicorn’s blackened horn can be healed by positive energy as well as negative energy, regardless of her creature type, as long as she holds the horn. When holding the horn, a spellcaster can also use its corrupted innocence to shape both positive and negative energy. Furthermore, if the spellcaster is able to spontaneously cast either cure or inflict spells (for an example, see the cleric’s spontaneous casting ability), then she can spontaneously cast both cure and inflict spells while wielding the unicorn’s blackened horn. If the wielder can channel energy using a class feature, twice per day she can channel the opposite type of energy that she normally channels. The unicorn’s horn imposes 1 permanent negative level on any good creature that is attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the horn is held in hand and disappears when the horn is no longer held.
