DESC:Itâ€™s in the Cards! Pierce the veil of mystery surrounding the occult symbolism of the harrow! Steeped in ancient tradition, harrow decks have been used for centuries to foretell the future, perform magical feats, send coded messages and warnings, and manipulate fate. Divine your fortune, learn games of skill and chance, summon allies, curse enemies, or even build a character based on harrow archetypes as you delve into the lore and secrets of the cards.
