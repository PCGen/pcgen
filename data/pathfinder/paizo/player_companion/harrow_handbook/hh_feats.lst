Description																																					Bonus Ability Pool					Source Page		Aspects						Benefits
All-Consuming Swing																CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack,Cleave,Vital Strike																				PRETOTALAB:8	PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_STR,13				DESC:You deliver unchecked destruction when you stand against multiple foes, sometimes to your own detriment.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.19								BENEFIT:Whenever you use Cleave or Great Cleave, you can apply the additional damage you would gain from Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike to the initial target of your attack. When you do so, the strain on your body causes you to take an amount of damage equal to the extra damage dealt by your Vital Strike feat. This self-inflicted damage is not reduced by damage reduction.
Bear's Balance																	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Iron Will	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Rage																											DESC:Your anger is always available below the surfce, but can be careflly directed. Those who would frce you to lose control encounter an unpleasant surprise.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.19								BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when not raging. When you fail a saving throw against a fear effect, you can choose to enter your rage rather than succumb to fear. You can not voluntarily end your rage until the fear effect expires or is ended in some other way (such as due to the death of the fear-inducing creature) or you exhaust your rounds of rage for the day. This feat has no effect if you are already raging when exposed to a fear effect.
Deadly Dealer																	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Arcane Strike									PRESKILL:1,Sleight of Hand=5																						DESC:Your skill with handling a deck and your arcane talents allow you to turn mundane cards into weapons.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.15								BENEFIT:You can throw a card as though it were a dart, with the same damage, range, and other features . You must use the Arcane Strike feat when throwing a card in this way, or else the card lacks the magical force and precision to deal lethal damage . A card is destroyed when thrown in this way. Harrow cards are treated as masterwork weapons when thrown using this feat, but are still destroyed after they are thrown . A harrow deck can no longer be used as a fortune-telling device after even a single card is thrown. A spellcaster with this feat can enhance a deck of cards as though it were a ranged weapon with S4 pieces of ammunition . This enhancement functions only when used in tandem with this feat, and has no affect on any other way the cards might be used . Only a character who possesses this feat can use an enhanced deck of cards; she must still use the Arcane Strike feat to activate the cards' enhancement. [SPECIAL] The Deadly Dealer feat allows a character to enhance sets of 54 harrow cards with any enhancement that would normally be able to apply to ammunition, for the same price that it would normally cost to enhance 50 pieces of ammunition. Only harrow decks may be enhanced in this way. Decks of cards made of special materials are not available for purchase.
Harrowed Summoning																CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Harrowed																																				DESC:Your summoned creatures are empowered by the magic of the harrow.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.14								BENEFIT:When you cast a conjuration (summoning) spell or use a spell-like ability to summon one or more creatures, you can draw two random cards from a complete harrow deck you own. Doing so adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the harrow deck) to the spell, but does not increase the spell's casting time. For the duration of the spell, each summoned creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability scores of the drawn card's suits. If both cards are the same suit, each summoned creature gains a +6 bonus to that ability score instead. If either card's alignment is a true match for the summoned creatures' alignment, the duration of the spell is doubled, while drawing an opposite match halves the duration of the spell. If both a true match and an opposite match are drawn, the spell's duration is unchanged. A creature summoned in this way is distinctly altered by the cards drawn. Its physical appearance reflects the visual elements of the cards (for example, a creature summoned with The Publican might have only one eye). The creature's personality is also influenced by the cards, but not so much as to alter its alignment (for example, The Snakebite might summon a creature that likes to gossip).
Merciless Beating																	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise,Gang Up																								PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_INT,13				DESC:When you have the numbers on your side, you can lend your strength to the group to give your shared enemy a savage pummeling.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.19								BENEFIT:Whenever you and two or more allies threaten an opponent, you can choose to forgo your flanking bonus to grant each of your allies a +1 flanking bonus on their attack rolls against the threatened creature. This bonus stacks with any flanking bonuses your allies might already have.

At any one time for the rest of that day, you may apply a +2 bonus on any d20 roll modified by the card's suit.

BENEFIT:As a result of being raised in a land steeped in tradition and superstition, you are skilled at communicating with the spirit world. Whenever you cast a spell from the divination school, you may use your Focus Item instead of the spell's material component, as long as the cost of the material component is no more than 1,000 gp. If you choose to perform the spell using your Focus Item and the spell's normal material component (regardless of that component's cost), you cast the spell at +1 caster level.
