No two suit seekers seem to share the same vision, though, and so most of these harrow-wielding inquisitors end up at odds with other diviners throughout Avistan and even one another.

Improvised Array						KEY:Suit Seeker ~ Improvised Array				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Inquisitor Class Feature.SuitSeekerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.22		DESC:The suit seeker can call upon the harrow to help her choose an appropriate judgment and bolster her effectiveness with that judgment. As part of activating her judgment ability, the suit seeker can draw an impromptu array of two cards from a complete harrow deck she owns. Once drawn, the array remains the same until the judgment effect ends, though the inquisitor can change her judgment at any time as a swift action, as normal. The act of drawing an improvised array requires a free hand, though the suit seeker can keep a drawn array in her belt or otherwise on her person to perform actions with both hands while still maintaining the cards' benefits. At 1st level, as long as the suit seeker has at least one card in her improvised array that matches her current judgment, she increases her effective inquisitor level by a number of levels equal to the number of matching cards for the purpose of determining that judgment's effects. At 8th level, when a suit seeker gains her second judgment, she can forgo pronouncing a second judgment and instead draw four cards for her improvised array. At 16th level, she can forgo pronouncing a second and third judgment and instead draw up to six cards for her improvised array, or she can forgo only her third judgment and draw an array of four cards. In addition to increasing her effective inquisitor level for the purpose of the corresponding judgment, a suit seeker with three or more cards of the same suit in her improvised array gains immunity to ability damage to the corresponding ability score. A suit seeker with five or more cards of the same suit in her improvised array gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability score. These benefts last until the suit seeker's judgment effect ends.

A suit seeker makes the following adjustments to her judgments. [Smiting] At 6th level, while the suit seeker has her smiting judgment active, her weapons can only count as an alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction if the selected alignment is represented on one of the suit seeker's cards in her current improvised array. If multiple alignments are represented in the improvised array, the suit seeker must select one. If the array contains only neutral cards, the suit seeker cannot beneft fom this judgment. She can change the alignment of her judgment to another alignment represented in the array as a swift action. [Resiliency] At 10th level, the DR provided by this judgment can change from magic to an alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) only if the selected alignment is represented on one of the suit seeker's cards in her current improvised array. If multiple alignments are represented in the improvised array, the suit seeker must select one. If the array contains only neutral cards, the suit seeker cannot beneft fom this judgment. She can change the alignment of this judgment to another alignment represented in the array as a swift action. This ability modifes judgment, second judgment, and thirdjudgment.
