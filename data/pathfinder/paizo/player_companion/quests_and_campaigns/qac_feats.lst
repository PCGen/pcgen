Completion Benefit: You learn how to coax the most out of your magic items.

SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based checks involving good-aligned outsiders and a +1 bonus to the DC of spells and spell-like abilities you use against such creatures.

You take a -2 penalty on Charisma-based checks involving good-aligned outsiders. Goal: Successfully trade your soul to an evil outsider. Completion Benefit: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to an ability score of your choice. This enhancement bonus can't be dispelled or removed save by the direct intervention of a deity, and counts as a supernatural ability. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks (including dispel checks and checks to bypass spell resistance) against good-aligned outsiders. If you die while under the effects of this agreement, you can't be brought back from the dead unless the evil outsider permits it. You lose your story benefits immediately and permanently if you renege on the arrangement by which you traded your soul, though you keep the feat's basic benefits.
Dynasty Founder	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: You must have lived in the chosen city for at least 1 year or be the heir of a former city leader.																																																							DESC:You will claim rulership of a city, whether under a larger government or independently.							SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:You gain followers as if you had the Leadership feat, although you cannot attract followers of a level higher than your level - 2. If you also have the Leadership feat, increase your Leadership score by 3 for the purpose of determining how many followers you have. Goal: Thwart all rivals to rulership over the chosen region, including at least one challenging foe. Completion Benefit: You gain control of the settlement (see the settlement rules in the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). Upon gaining this benefit and once per year thereafter, you can attempt to alter the settlement in one of the following ways by attempting a DC 25 Diplomacy check modified by the settlement's Society modifier or a DC 25 Intimidate check modified by its Law modifier: Move the settlement's alignment 1 step closer to yours along either the good-evil or law-chaos axis. Replace one settlement quality with another. Change the government type. Significantly alter the laws. Failure indicates that popular opinion in the city successfully opposes you. In addition, from now on, your followers gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws as long as they can see you. Special: For groups using the kingdom-building rules from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, you can optionally use the rules for establishing a settlement to complete the goal of this story feat.

Goal: Cross through a dangerous place without a map or a guide knowledgeable about the area, stopping for no longer than 16 hours at a time, and along the way overcome an appropriate number of natural hazards, obstacles, and/or enemies, at least one of which must qualify as a challenging foe. Completion Benefit: You and one ally per 3 ranks of Survival can move overland without being slowed by difficult terrain (allies must remain within 30 feet of you to be affected). Once per day, you can make a preternaturally accurate estimate regarding your path, as if you had cast find the path on yourself (caster level equals your character level).
Foeslayer		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: You must have been defeated and robbed of at least half your possessions by a particular group of humanoids or monstrous humanoids, or have the An Eye for an Eye, Hated Foe, Raiders, or Vengeance background (see Ultimate Campaign).

DESC:Your feud with your enemies can be quenched only with blood.												SOURCEPAGE:p.10	BENEFIT:The save DCs for any of your spells or abilities increase by 1 when used against the chosen group, and you receive a +1 dodge bonus to AC against their attacks.

Your dodge bonus to AC against such foes increases to +2.
Liberator		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: You must have been enslaved for at least 6 months, or have the Imprisoned or Kidnapped background (see Ultimate Campaign).

In addition, as a standard action you can inspire slaves and former slaves within 120 feet, giving them temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your character level and a +1 bonus on saving throws. These benefits last for 1 hour, and a given creature can receive this benefit only once per day. These are mind-affecting effects, and the inspiring bonus is language-dependent.
Planar Traveler	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: You must be related to an outsider or have been born on a plane other than the Material Plane.																																																								DESC:The confines of the Material Plane cannot sate your wanderlust, and you walk between alternate spheres of reality unhindered.

Goal: Spend at least 24 consecutive hours on three different planes of existence other than your home plane or more than a month on a single plane other than your home plane. Demiplanes do not count for the purposes of fulfilling this goal. Completion Benefit: Whenever you cast a spell or use a magic item to travel to another plane, you always arrive exactly where you had intended. In addition, when identifying portals with the first benefit of this feat, you gain a glimpse of what you would see, hear, and smell upon arriving on the other end of the portal.
Prophet		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to cast divine spells, and you must either have received a vision from your god (or another appropriate supernatural entity) or have the Marked by the Gods background (see Ultimate Campaign).

SOURCEPAGE:p.12	BENEFIT:If you are nonevil and worship a nonevil deity, whenever you cast a beneficial spell on an ally you gain a +1 sacred bonus to AC for 1 round per spell level. If you are evil or worship an evil deity, whenever you cast a harmful spell on an enemy you gain a +1 profane bonus to AC for 1 round per spell level. Casting a spell on yourself does not count unless it also affects an ally. Goal: Convert an appropriate number of creatures to the worship of your deity.

Truth-Seeker	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: You must have visited a ruin or forgotten place that has been abandoned for at least five times as long as you've been alive.																																																			DESC:A tantalizing secret from the past calls to you, and you intend to discover it.								SOURCEPAGE:p.13	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (history) checks.

In addition, whenever you attempt a Will save to disbelieve an illusion, you may roll twice and take the better result.
Object of Legend	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: You must have some highly personal stake in attaining the object of your quest as determined collectively by you and the GM-such as needing an ancestral weapon to exact your revenge against a known betrayer, seeking to destroy the artifact that caused your family's downfall generations ago, or attempting to behead a monster that ravaged your homeland during your youth.										DESC:The object of your quest drives you ever forward.													SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:When you gain this feat, select one of the quest objects on this page or the facing page, or devise a quest object with your GM based on the quest objects presented in this section. You gain a +2 bonus on any Knowledge checks to gain information on the object of your quest. If you have 10 or more ranks in the Knowledge skill in question, the bonus increases to +4. In addition, once per day when you threaten a critical hit against a foe who specifically aims to stop you from completing your quest, you gain a +10 bonus on your confirmation roll against that opponent. You must announce the use of this ability after threatening the critical hit and before rolling your confirmation roll. This bonus does not stack with bonuses on confirmation rolls from other feats, such as Critical Focus. Goal: Attain the object of your quest, as determined by you and the GM upon taking this feat. This likely means decidedly obtaining the item for yourself, though in some cases (such as when the quest object is more abstract or intangible) this might mean slaying a certain foe, achieving a certain honor, or completing some other set of predetermined objectives. Completion Benefit: You gain renown throughout a region, perhaps even an entire continent. You are sung of in bardic tales and can be the subject of spells such as legend lore, regardless of your actual level. Commoners in nearby lands know of your deeds, and your reputation precedes you in numerous lands. In addition, you gain a specific benefit keyed to the object of your quest. See the quest objects in this section for examples of completion benefits when devising your own quest objects for use with this feat. Special: This feat may be taken more than once. Each time it is taken, select a new quest object to strive for. As with all story feats, a character cannot take this feat again until she has completed the goal of the feat's first iteration.

###Block: Feats
# Ability Name		Category of Ability	Type			Required Ability					Required Stat	Required Text															Description																						Source Page		Benefits
Center of Power		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Leadership score 13, hold a leadership role related to running a kingdom.	DESC:You have posted loyal followers in the most vital places.													SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:Choose a building in your kingdom as your center of power, and dedicate one of the followers granted to you by the Leadership feat to overseeing that location. For every kingdom turn in which that follower does nothing but oversee that location, the benefits that building grants to your kingdom's Economy, Fame, Loyalty, and Stability are doubled and any penalties are negated. This feat does not allow a building to grant benefits it does not normally provide, and has no effect on a building's other effects. This feat only applies to one building, and committing multiple followers to this or different buildings has no effect-the selected location is treated as being of particular importance to you, and its uniqueness combined with the follower's loyalty grants it special efficiencies. The same follower does not have to oversee your center of power every month, but you must keep at least one follower dedicated to this location for the entire month to gain this feat's benefits. Once per year, you may change which building is your center of power.
Expert Trainer		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												DESC:You have a special knack for a certain profession and take to it with ease.										SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:Choose three character classes. For the purposes of retraining, you are always considered to have a retraining synergy with these classes, regardless of your current class. Additionally, retraining any class option takes you half the time it normally would (and thus half the gp cost), though retraining a class still takes the normal amount of time (5 days for a class with which you have synergy, 7 for a class with which you don't). If you take this feat via retraining or replace it with another feat in the same manner, the retraining time takes twice as long as normal in regards to this feat only.
Focused Overseer		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Focused Worker				PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Focused Worker.											DESC:Your attention to detail provides you with insights into how to more effectively and economically gain certain commodities.		SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You can spend a day of downtime to purchase one type of capital for half its normal cost (see Purchasing Capital on page 77 of Ultimate Campaign). This capital must be the same as the focus capital you chose for the Focused Worker feat. However, the cost of the neglected capital, chosen as part of the same Focused Worker feat, increases by half again its normal amount. These changes in price apply to both the purchased cost and the earned cost of the affected forms of capital. Special: You may take this feat twice, but only if you have also chosen the Focused Worker feat twice. This feat only affects one feat's focus capital. The second time you take this feat, choose the other focus capital from your Focused Worker feats.
Focused Worker		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												DESC:Your attention to detail provides you with an excess of some commodities, at the cost of others.							SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You excel at performing skilled work for a certain type of capital, but are less adept at generating another type of capital (see page 78 of Ultimate Campaign). Choose one of the following types of capital to be your focus capital: Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic. Whenever you spend downtime to perform skilled work to gain focus capital, you gain half again the normal amount (rounded down). However, you must also choose a second, separate type of capital from the same list to be your neglected capital. Whenever you spend downtime to perform skilled work to gain neglected capital, you gain only half the amount you normally would. This feat only affects capital you gain by performing skilled work, not capital you might gain by performing unskilled work, purchasing capital, or running a business. For example, say you chose Goods as your focus capital and Magic as your neglected capital. If you spent a day performing skilled work to gain Goods, and the result of your Sleight of Hands skill check is a 33, you would gain 4 Goods (rather than the usual 3 for a result of 30 or higher). However, if you were to spend the following day using your Spellcraft check to perform skilled work and again got a result of 33, you would only gain 2 Magic rather than the usual 3. Special: You may take this feat twice. The second time, you must choose the other two types of capital to be a focus and a neglected capital.
Fortunate Ruler		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Hold the Ruler leadership role for a kingdom.						DESC:Your good luck shines on your people, even in the most trying times.											SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:During a kingdom's Event phase, once an event's type and danger level has been determined, you may choose to roll twice on the applicable kingdom or settlement table and choose either result. You must declare you are using this feat before the results of the initial roll are revealed.
Fortunate Manager		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Own at least one building.									DESC:Your good luck helps you and your business persevere even during the most troublesome times.							SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:During the Event phase of downtime, if an event occurs and the GM rolls on a building event table or organization event table (see pages 114-129 of Ultimate Campaign), you may, once per week, choose to roll twice on the applicable table and choose either result. You must declare you are using this feat before the results of the initial roll are revealed.
Inspirational Commander	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General								PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Charisma 13.												DESC:Armies under your command enjoy higher morale thanks to your excellent leadership.									SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:You or any army that is under your command gains a +2 bonus on Morale checks. Additionally, you gain two additional boons of your choice (see page 240 of Ultimate Campaign).
Natural Ruler		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Hold a leadership role related to running a kingdom.					DESC:You have a special talent for ruling a nation, and take to the task with ease.										SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:Choose an ability score. Any time your leadership role calls for that ability score to affect one of your kingdom's attributes, your modifier to that ability score is treated as being +2 higher. For example, if you choose Charisma and occupy the General or High Priest leadership role, your Charisma modifier to affect your kingdom's stability would be +2 higher than normal. However, if you occupied the Spymaster leadership role-which employs the Intelligence and Wisdom ability scores-this feat would grant no benefit. Additionally, the entire kingdom gains +2 Stability for as long as you occupy a leadership role. Special: You may gain this feat multiple times, but each time you must choose a different ability score. The bonus to Stability gained from this feat stacks.
Precocious Youth		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Young age category.											DESC:Even in youth, you seek to be more adult than your childish peers, a personal trait that will no doubt aid you in future years.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:You lose one of the penalties associated with the young age category, either -2 Constitution, -2 Strength, or -2 Wisdom. Upon reaching adulthood you may exchange this feat for Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes. Special: You may take this feat up to three times. Each time you do, it affects a different penalty and must be exchanged for a different feat upon reaching adulthood.
Superintendent		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Own at least one room.										DESC:You have a nearly endless arsenal of tricks and methods to keep your buildings in top shape.							SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:When a room you own gains the broken condition, you may repair it for half the normal cost in gold pieces and other capital, rounded up (see page 90 of Ultimate Campaign). Additionally, buildings and organizations you've created are not affected by capital attrition (see page 81 of Ultimate Campaign) until 1 month of your absence. From that point, capital attrition affects your buildings and organizations as normal.
