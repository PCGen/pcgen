###Block: Feats
# Ability Name		Category of Ability	Type			Required Ability					Required Stat	Required Text															Description																						Source Page		Benefits
Center of Power		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Leadership score 13, hold a leadership role related to running a kingdom.	DESC:You have posted loyal fllowers in the most vital places.													SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:Choose a building in your kingdom as your center of power, and dedicate one of the fllowers granted to you by the Leadership feat to overseeing that location. For every kingdom turn in which that fllower does nothing but oversee that location, the benefits that building grants to your kingdom's Economy, Fame, Loyalty, and Stability are doubled and any penalties are negated. This feat does not allow a building to grant benefits it does not normally provide, and has no efect on a building's other efects. This feat only applies to one building, and committing multiple fllowers to this or diferent buildings has no efect-the selected location is treated as being of particular importance to you, and its uniqueness combined with the fllower's loyalty grants it special eficiencies. The same fllower does not have to oversee your center of power every month, but you must keep at least one fllower dedicated to this location for the entire month to gain this feat's benefits. Once per year, you may change which building is your center of power.
Expert Trainer		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												DESC:You have a special knack for a certain profession and take to it with ease.										SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:Choose three character classes. For the purposes of retraining, you are always considered to have a retraining synergy with these classes, regardless of your current class. Additionally, retraining any class option takes you half the time it normally would (and thus half the gp cost), though retraining a class still takes the normal amount of time (s days for a class with which you have synergy, 7 for a class with which you don't). If you take this feat via retraining or replace it with another feat in the same manner, the retraining time takes twice as long as normal in regards to this feat only.
Focused Overseer		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Focused Worker				PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Focused Worker.											DESC:Your attention to detail provides you with insights into how to more efectively and economically gain certain commodities.		SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You can spend a day of downtime to purchase one type of capital for half its normal cost see Purchasing Capital on page 77 of Ultimate Campaign. This capital must be the same as the focus capital you chose for the Focused Worker feat. However, the cost of the neglected capital, chosen as part of the same Focused Worker fat, increases by half again its normal amount. These changes in price apply to both the purchased cost and the earned cost of the afected frms of capital. Special: You may take this feat twice, but only if you have also chosen the Focused Worker feat twice. This feat only afects one feat's focus capital. The second time you take this feat, choose the other focus capital from your Focused Worker feats.
Focused Worker		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												DESC:Your attention to detail provides you with an excess of some commodities, at the cost of others.							SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You excel at perfrming skilled work for a certain type of capital, but are less adept at generating another type of capital (see page 78 of Ultimate CampaiJn). Choose one of the fllowing types of capital to be your focus capital: Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic. Whenever you spend downtime to perfrm skilled work to gain focus capital, you gain half again the normal amount (rounded down). However, you must also choose a second, separate type of capital fom the same list to be your neglected capital. Whenever you spend downtime to perfrm skilled work to gain neglected capital, you gain only half the amount you normally would. This feat only afects capital you gain by perfrming skilled work, not capital you might gain by perfrming unskilled work, purchasing capital, or running a business. For example, say you chose Goods as your focus capital and Magic as your neglected capital. If you spent a day perfrming skilled work to gain Goods, and the result of your Sleight of Hands skill check is a 33, you would gain 4 Goods (rather than the usual 3 for a result of30 or higher). However, if you were to spend the fllowing day using your Spellcraft check to perfrm skilled work and again got a result of 33, you would only gain 2 Magic rather than the usual 3. Special: You may take this feat twice. The second time, you must choose the other two types of capital to be a focus and a neglected capital.
Fortunate Ruler		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Hold the Ruler leadership role for a kingdom.						DESC:Your good luck shines on your people, even in the most trying times.

Natural Ruler		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Hold a leadership role related to running a kingdom.					DESC:You have a special talent for ruling a nation, and take to the task with ease.										SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:Choose an ability score. Any time your leadership role calls for that ability score to affect one of your kingdom's attributes, your modifer to that ability score is treated as being +2 higher. For example, if you choose Charisma and occupy the General or High Priest leadership role, your Charisma modifer to afect your kingdom's stability would be +2 higher than normal. However, if you occupied the Spymaster leadership role-which employs the Intelligence and Wisdom ability scores-this feat would grant no benefit. Additionally, the entire kingdom gains +2 Stability for as long as you occupy a leadership role. Special: You may gain this feat multiple times, but each time you must choose a diferent ability score. The bonus to Stability gained fom this feat stacks.
Precocious Youth		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Young age category.											DESC:Even in youth, you seek to be more adult than your childish peers, a personal trait that will no doubt aid you in future years.

Upon reaching adulthood you may exchange this feat for Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes. Special: You may take this feat up to three times. Each time you do, it afects a diferent penalty and must be exchanged for a diferent feat upon reaching adulthood.
Superintendent		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Own at least one room.										DESC:You have a nearly endless arsenal of tricks and methods to keep your buildings in top shape.							SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:When a room you own gains the broken condition, you may repair it for half the normal cost in gold pieces and other capital, rounded up (see page 90 of Ultimate CampaiJn). Additionally, buildings and organizations you've created are not afected by capital attrition (see page 81 of Ultimate Campai1n) until 1 month of your absence. From that point, capital attrition afects your buildings and organizations as normal.
