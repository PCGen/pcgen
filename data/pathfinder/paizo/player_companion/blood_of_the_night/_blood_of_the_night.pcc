DESC:Inherit the night and reclaim the power that is rightfully yours! Fight off the vampiric hordes that threaten the safety of humanity, or join their undead ranks in your pursuit of unholy strength. Will you vanquish the blood-sucking villains that seek to rule the streets beneath the cover of darkness? Or will your undead heritage prove that you are more monster than mortal? While others sleep, you find renewed vigor beneath the starlit sky, and whether you seek the blood of the living or the dead, one thing remains certain: the hunt is on.
