They have spent long years mastering the Aldori dueling sword, against both other dueling swords and all manner of other weaponry.

All creatures within 30 feet treat you as if you belonged there, effectively ignoring you. Creatures outside of this area may notice that you appear out of place, but as soon as they approach within 30 feet they are affected by the magic and no longer think something is amiss. If you interact with an affected creature in any way, it gains a Will save (DC %1) to disbelieve the illusion and notice you. The effect lasts for %2 minutes, or until the illusion is dispelled. The minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a mind-affecting phantasm effect. This ability does not turn you invisible and opponents are not considered flat-footed. It does not allow you to disguise yourself as a specific individual, type of person, or member of another race, so you cannot blend into a group of uniformed guards or appear as a member of an individual's family, and a human cannot blend into a group of gnolls. You can blend in with any group made up of different types of people, such as a crowd of courtiers in a king's throne room, and you can disguise yourself (either through magic or more mundane means) to appear as a specific type of person or another race (such as a uniformed guard or a gnoll) before using this ability.|MageOfTheVeilFaceInTheCrowdDC|MageOfTheVeilFaceInTheCrowdDuration																					BONUS:VAR|MageOfTheVeilFaceInTheCrowdDC|10+(IllusionSchoolLVL/2)+INT	BONUS:VAR|MageOfTheVeilFaceInTheCrowdDuration|IllusionSchoolLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|MageOfTheVeilFaceInTheCrowdDuration	ASPECT:CheckType|Minutes per day
