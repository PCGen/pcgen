Pact						KEY:Pact Wizard ~ Pact					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Features.PactWizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																												DESC:A pact wizard enters into a bargain with an extraplanar being in order to gain increased wizardly powers. At 1st level, he selects a patron belonging to one specific subtype of outsider for which there exists an improved familiar option (such as devil or azata). The pact wizard can select a subtype of outsider even with a diametrically opposed alignment; in this case, the patron being offers the pact in an attempt to tempt or redeem the pact wizard. A pact wizard whose alignment shifts away from the chosen outsider subtype, who grossly abuses his familiar or any outsider of the chosen subtype, or who commits egregious acts against the alignment of the patron loses all the benefits of this archetype (but keeps the additional opposition school) until he receives an atonement.

#Spirit Binder
Soulbound Familiar			KEY:Spirit Binder ~ Soulbound Familiar		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Features.PactWizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																												DESC:A spirit binder must select a familiar for his arcane bond. Unlike in a normal familiar-summoning ritual, a spirit binder created his special familiar through a dangerous ritual catalyzed by the death of a loved one. Before the loved one's spirit passed on to the Boneyard, the spirit binder was able to bind the spirit to an animal or vermin, which then became his familiar. A soulbound familiar's personality is that of the lost loved one, rather than a servant of the spirit binder. It can have any alignment, even one that is diametrically opposed to the spirit binder's. A soulbound familiar has the base attack bonus and base saving throws of the loved one's favored class (using the spirit binder's level as its level). If the loved one died before the beginning of the campaign, the spirit binder selects the familiar's favored class at 1st level and it cannot be changed. This ability alters arcane bond. [Altered Base Attack and Saves are NOT IMPLEMENTED!!]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.9

While the familiar is melded, its body becomes part of the synergist's and can't be targeted or affected by any means (including ongoing effects), though the familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically. The symbiosis causes the synergist to adopt some basic physical features of the familiar and grants additional abilities based on the synergist's level.

This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute intervals. Additionally, during symbiosis the synergist gains a single natural attack of a type possessed by its familiar. The attack deals 1d6 points of damage if a primary attack (1d6 for Small synergists) and 1d4 points of damage if a secondary attack (1d3 for Small synergists).|WitchLVL|PRECLASS:1,Witch=8|!PRECLASS:1,Witch=11	DESC:During symbiosis the synergist gains any of the following abilities the familiar possesses; Burrow 30 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 90 feet (good maneuverability), swim 90 feet, blindsense 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, constrict, ferocity, grab, jet, poison, pounce, rake, trample, trip, and web.
