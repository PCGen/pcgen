# Ability											Description																								Benefit
CATEGORY=Special Ability|AgathionBlooded ~ Enlightened Warrior.MOD																																																																						DESC:You have always found it easy to maintain inner peace and enlightenment that translate well to the battlefield. You may take levels in monk even while maintaining a neutral or neutral good alignment.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|AgathionBlooded ~ Speech of the Wilds.MOD																																																																						DESC:Like your agathion ancestor, you have a knack for communicating with other creatures, and you are adept at breaking down language barriers. You can speak one extra language.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|AngelBlooded ~ Celestial Tracker.MOD																																																																							DESC:You share the same talent for tracking evildoers that your angelic ancestor possessed. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks made to follow tracks. In addition, you treat trails as being up to 24 hours fresher than they actually are when using the Survival skill to follow tracks.																																																			BONUS:SITUATION|Survival=Follow or identify tracks|1|TYPE=Trait
CATEGORY=Special Ability|AngelBlooded ~ Planetar's Visions.MOD																																																																							DESC:Ever since you were a child, you've experienced vivid dreams of cutting down hordes of shrieking, twisted Azatas. Whenever you succeed at a critical hit with a melee weapon against an evil outsider, you ignore an amount of the outsider's damage reduction (if any) equal to the critical multiplier of your weapon (this cannot reduce a creature's damage reduction to below 0).
CATEGORY=Special Ability|ArchonBlooded ~ Good Influence.MOD																																																																								DESC:You possess an innate ability to motivate and inspire others to do the right thing. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks when attempting to persuade a nongood creature to make a decision that benefits the cause of good, and when persuading a nonlawful creature to make a decision in line with the laws of the region. These bonuses stack if you attempt to persuade a nongood, nonlawful creature to take a lawful good action.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|ArchonBlooded ~ Lantern Spirit.MOD																																																																								DESC:Your celestial ancestor was a lantern archon for centuries before ascending to a higher rank. You feel a strange sense of nostalgia whenever you use your continual flame spell-like ability, and can use it as a move action instead of a standard action.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|AzataBlooded ~ Bralani's Step.MOD																																																																								DESC:Your ancestor was a bralani, an azata known for its untamed speed in battle. When in combat, you feel a fierce surge of energy through your limbs. Once per day, you may move an additional 5 feet as part of a move action.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|AzataBlooded ~ Lillend's Harp.MOD																																																																								DESC:Your ancestor was a lillend, a being of exceptional grace and singular musical talent. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perform (string) checks. This bonus increases to +2 when you make a Perform check as part of a bardic performance.																																																																							BONUS:SKILL|Perform (String Instruments)|1|TYPE=Trait
CATEGORY=Special Ability|GarudaBlooded ~ Snake Hater.MOD																																																																								DESC:You've always loathed serpents and other slithering monsters, ever since you can remember, and have studied them extensively. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and Knowledge (dungeoneering) is always a class skill for you.																																																																				BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (Dungeoneering)|2|TYPE=Trait					CSKILL:Knowledge (Dungeoneering)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|GarudaBlooded ~ Toxophilite.MOD																																																																								DESC:You've inherited some of your celestial ancestor's prowess with the bow, and gain a +2 trait bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits with bows.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|PeriBlooded ~ Burnished Skin.MOD																																																																								DESC:Sometime during your adolescence, you suffered severe burns in a devastating fire. Along with your scars, you developed the uncanny ability to tell what is and isn't real, gaining a +2 trait bonus on saving throws made to disbelieve illusions.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|PeriBlooded ~ Pyronmancer.MOD																																																																								DESC:You're especially adept at casting flamebased spells. You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls for any spell you cast with the fire descriptor. Spells that do not deal damage do not benefit from this trait.

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Adrift.MOD																																																																										DESC:You never felt like you belonged in your family.  You were different, an outsider, and you grew up unable to bond with the people around you. Now, as an adult, you are still a little odd and others have a hard time understanding what makes you tick. You receive a +1 trait bonus on saving throws made to resist charm and compulsion effects.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Clergy Member.MOD																																																																									DESC:You belong to a particular faith, and your religious leaders see you as a mortal aspect of their deity. You are treated with respect and graciousness whenever you visit a temple of your faith. You receive a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks when interacting with ordained members of your religion, and once per week you can request aid from a temple of your faith. The GM has final say in what sort of aid you can reasonably request, but in general you may ask for the casting of a 1st-level spell or for a nonmagical item worth 5o gp or less.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Ethical Leader.MOD																																																																									DESC:You attract followers who agree with your philosophical outlook on life. Your followers and cohorts are more willing to serve you because of their confidence in your strong moral position. You gain a +1 trait bonus to your Leadership score if all your cohorts and followers have an alignment within one step of your alignment.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Faith Healer.MOD																																																																									DESC:You have an unearthly appearance and soothing aura about you that make people believe you are gifted with divine powers. You learned at a young age to make use of your gift in order to make money, and you've found ways to ethically justify your work. You can make a Heal check weekly to earn money as though making a Profession check. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Heal checks.																																													BONUS:SKILL|Heal|1|TYPE=Trait
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Innocent.MOD																																																																										DESC:No one can believe someone as pure as you could be deceptive in any way. You have an air of innocence about you, and people have a hard time believing you could ever do anyone harm. When you make a Bluff check to tell a lie, your target always wants to believe you, granting you the standard +5 bonus on your Bluff check. This bonus only applies if the lie you tell is either believable or unlikely.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Planar Negotiator.MOD																																																																								DESC:You are skilled at convincing outsiders that you require their aid. Whenever you cast lesser planar ally, planar ally, or greater planar ally, you receive a 10%% discount on the monetary cost required by the summoned outsiders. This bonus has no effect on services the outsiders may demand in order to strike a bargain.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Selective Health.MOD																																																																								DESC:You are resistant to most illnesses that strike those around you, but vulnerable to the contagions of evil. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saves against diseases. However, whenever you must make a Fortitude saving throw against a disease inflicted by an undead creature or evil outsider (such as mummy rot or a vrock's spores), you do not gain this bonus, and instead take a -2 penalty on your Fortitude save.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Wary.MOD																																																																										DESC:You grew up around people who were jealous of and hostile toward you. Perhaps your parents were not pleased to have a child touched by the divine-they may have berated or beaten you, or even sold you into slavery for an exorbitant price. You grew up mistrustful of others and believing your unique appearance to be a curse. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disguise and Sense Motive checks.																																													BONUS:SKILL|Disguise|1|TYPE=Trait	BONUS:SKILL|Sense motive|1|TYPE=Trait

Pallavi of Nirvana's Blossoming	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Pallavi of Nirvanas Blossoming	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:PallaviOfNirDC|0			DESC:You begin your dance slowly, focusing on exact posture, the position of your limbs, even the direction of your gaze, then build to a blur of motion. Upon completing the performance, you summon a fixed aura of divine sunlight that glows in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on you. The divine sunlight acts as true daylight and affects creatures damaged or destroyed by such light. The light is as bright as sunlight at full noon and counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower. If the dance is performed in an area of more powerful magical darkness, both the divine sunlight and darkness are temporarily negated so that otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Within the area of the sunlight, plants grow and blossom rapidly, becoming a overgrown tangle. This effect mimics the overgrowth version of plant growth. You and one ally per three bard levels are immune to the movement-impairing effects of the overgrowth. The divine sunlight and all its associated effects last for 1 minute per bard level you possess. Use: 3 bardic performance rounds. Action: 3 full rounds.|PallaviOfNirDC	BONUS:VAR|PallaviOfNirDC|10+(MasterpieceLVL/2)+CHA		SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Rondeau of Heavenly Order		KEY:Masterpiece ~ Rondeau of Heavenly Order		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:RondeauHeavenlyorderDC|0	DESC:This song follows a set repetition of verses and refrains with a pattern of syllables that remains constant from line to line. As you sing, listeners find their actions bound by your song's relentless order. One enemy per bard level within listening range must make a successful Will save or find its movements hampered. A creature that fails its save can move only in a straight line each turn. The creature can choose which direction it wishes to move each turn, but it can move only along a straight line in that direction, and cannot move around corners or otherwise deviate from this line until its next turn. This effect lasts as long as you maintain the performance. Although this song has words, it is not language-dependent. Use: 1 bardic performance rounds. Action: 1 full rounds.|RondeauHeavenlyOrderDC																																																								BONUS:VAR|RondeauHeavenlyorderDC|10+(MasterpieceLVL/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Symphony of the Elysian Heart		KEY:Masterpiece ~ Symphony of the Elysian Heart		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:SymphonyElysianHeartDC|0	DESC:The complex arpeggios in this piece follow each other so quickly that the music can sound jumbled and disjointed at first. As the piece progresses, however, distinct phrases emerge, creating a wild but harmonious piece that inspires feelings of unfettered freedom. You and up to one ally per bard level within 30 feet who can hear you can move and attack normally for the duration of your performance, even if under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement. This effect is identical to that of freedom of movement, except that this masterpiece does not allow subjects to move and attack normally while underwater unless these creatures would already be able to do so, and only lasts as long as you continue the performance. Use: 1 bardic performance rounds. Action: 1 full rounds.|SymphonyElysianHeartDC																																																								BONUS:VAR|SymphonyElysianHeartDC|10+(MasterpieceLVL/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.28
