CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aasimar ~ Clergy Member.MOD	DESC:You belong to a particular faith, and your religious leaders see you as a mortal aspect of their deity.	BENEFIT:.CLEAR|You belong to a particular faith, and your religious leaders see you as a mortal aspect of their deity. You are treated with respect and graciousness whenever you visit a temple of your faith. You receive a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks when interacting with ordained members of your religion, and once per scenario you can request aid from a temple of your faith. The GM has final say in what sort of aid you can reasonably request, but in general you may ask for the casting of a 1st-level spell or for a nonmagical item worth 50 gp or less.
