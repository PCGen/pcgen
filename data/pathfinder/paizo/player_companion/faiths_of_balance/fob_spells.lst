###Block: Full Spell Descriptions
# Spell Name			Description
Fairness.MOD			DESC:Humanoid creatures affected by this spell must trade fairly with others to the best of their knowledge. If they know the fair value (or even an estimated fair value) of a good or service, they cannot allow a trade to proceed if it would benefit one side unfairly, preventing them from cheating another while under the influence of this spell. The symbol of Abadar appears above the heads of those affected by this spell, making those affected and unaffected by the spell immediately apparent.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Seducer's Eyes.MOD		DESC:This spell increases your physical allure. You gain a +(min(1+floor(CASTERLEVEL/4)),5) bonus on Charisma-based skill checks, but only benefits you when interacting with those who might conceivably find you sexually attractive. You do not gain this bonus against those you or your allies are attacking or threatening.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lighten Object.MOD		DESC:This spell decreases the target's weight by half. If cast on armor, it improves the armor check penalty by 1, though it does not change the armor's categorization as light, medium, or heavy.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lighten Object (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell decreases up to (CASTERLEVEL/2) targets' weight by half. If cast on armor, it improves the armor check penalty by 1, though it does not change the armor's categorization as light, medium, or heavy.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Read Weather.MOD			DESC:This spell allows you to precisely forecast the weather at your current location for the next 48 hours, providing you with advance warning of storms, blizzards, tornadoes, and other such meteorological phenomena. It applies only to the weather that would arise normally and naturally, and does not take into account any magical occurrences that might change the weather of an area.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sky Swim.MOD			DESC:This spell grants the target the ability to swim through the air. Creatures with a swim speed can move through the air at that speed. Those without a swim speed must make Swim checks to move as normal. Still air is treated as calm water, light or moderate wind is treated as rough water, strong or severe wind is treated as stormy water, and stronger winds cannot be swum through (see Core Rulebook page 439). This spell does not grant the ability to breathe air to creatures that normally can't.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Abstemiousness.MOD		DESC:Not everyone can achieve the physical stamina of the monk, but sometimes Irori smiles on his worshipers and allows them a reprieve from physical hungers and wants. This spell magically enhances a handful of simple food, imbuing it with enough nutrition to satisfy a Medium or smaller creature for a full day. The spell does not create food, and as such will not alone prevent someone from starving, but it can extend even limited reserves for extended periods. |PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Gauge.MOD			DESC:Upon casting this spell, you immediately know a selection of the spells the target creature has prepared or knows. The number of spells revealed to you is equal to your caster level. The target's lowest-level spells are revealed first - ignoring 0-level spells - in a random order. Once all of the target's 1st-levels spells are revealed, the spell begins revealing 2nd-level spells, then 3rd-level spells. This spell does not reveal spells of 4th level or higher, nor does it reveal spell-like abilities or other special abilities. If cast on a creature that is not a spellcaster, that only has spells of 0 level or of 4th level or higher prepared, that has expended all of its spells, or that has not prepared any spells that day, the spell is expended without effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Early Judgment.MOD		DESC:You show one creature the effect of its life so far and what it might expect when it passes under Pharasma's impartial gaze at the end of its life. Depending on the creature's alignment and its adherence to its ethos, you can provide it a brief glimpse of the reward or punishment that waits for it when it dies by showing it a mental image of its destined plane in the Great Beyond. If your target is good-aligned, it must save or be fascinated for 1d4 rounds. If your target is neutral-aligned, it must save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. If your target is evil-aligned, it must save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
