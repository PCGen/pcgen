DESC:Command the battlefield from afar with Ranged Tactics Toolbox! The fresh new tips, tricks, and tactics in this volume enable your Pathfinder RPG character to perform a huge variety of daring deeds from a distance—whether you're launching fearsome warning shots at distant foes, hurling axes that swirl with cyclonic energy, or shooting your bow while clinging to a rope with your legs.
