# Spell Name		Type				Classes of caster											School			Sub-School			Descriptor			Components	Casting Time			Range					Target Area or Effect												Duration								Save Info				Spell Resistance		Source Page		Description
Augmenting Wall		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=5								SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:See Text	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:20-ft.-high wall of energy whose area is up to (CASTERLEVEL) 10-ft. squares	DURATION:(floor(CASTERLEVEL/2)) rounds (see text)	SAVEINFO:None (object)		SPELLRES:No (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:You create a wall of elemental energy. Upon casting the spell, choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The spell gains the chosen descriptor, and any thrown weapons or ammunition that pass through the augmenting wall as part of a ranged attack deal 1d6 points of energy damage of the specified type in addition to their normal damage. The wall has no effect on melee weapons. As you cast the spell, you can limit the wall so that it only affects ranged weapons passing through it in the direction of your choice. Doing so halves the spell's duration.
Bloody Arrows		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Inquisitor,Magus,Ranger=3|Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=4	SCHOOL:Necromancy										COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One living creature										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:None (harmless)	SPELLRES:No (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:When the spell's target hits a creature with a ranged weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, the struck creature takes 1 point of bleed damage. The bleed damage dealt by this spell is cumulative up to a maximum of %1 points of bleed damage.|min(5,floor(CASTERLEVEL/2))
Calm Air			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Summoner=4|Sorcerer,Wizard=5						SCHOOL:Abjuration						DESCRIPTOR:Air		COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long				TARGETAREA:Cylinder ((CASTERLEVEL*5)-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes				SAVEINFO:None (object)		SPELLRES:No (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:This spell calms the air and disperses fog, dust, and other particles. The wind force in the area is reduced in strength by %1 steps (to a minimum wind force of light) and clouds are dispersed. If a magical cloud or wind's point of origin is inside the area of a calm air spell, the whole effect is suppressed; otherwise, only the part inside the area is suppressed. Suppression requires a caster level check (DC 11 + effect's caster level). You can move the effect as a standard action.|floor(CASTERLEVEL/4)
Conversing Wind		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=4								SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Air		COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:(CASTERLEVEL) miles	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius spread										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours					SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:As whispering wind, except after delivering its first message the wind waits for 1 round, then copies what it hear, and returns at the same speed and by the same route. It delivers what it heard to the location where the spell was originally cast. The wind continues back and forth in this way until the duration ends or the spell is dismissed.
Rain of Arrows		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation					COMPS:V,S,M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long				TARGETAREA:15-ft.-radius cloud of arrows									DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex halves		SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You conjure a cloud of magical arrows that rain down on any creatures and objects in the indicated area. You must have line of sight to the intended area. The arrows deal %1d6 points of piercing damage to each creature and object in a 15-foot radius centered on the targeted square or intersection. If the arrows used as a material component are all made of the same material (such as cold iron), the arrows created by the spell are also made of that material.|min(20,CASTERLEVEL)
Telekinetic Volley	TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2								SCHOOL:Transmutation									COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Up to (CASTERLEVEL) touched objects weighing up to 5 lbs. each			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or until discharged [D]	SAVEINFO:None (object)		SPELLRES:No (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:When you cast the spell and once per round thereafter, you can launch one item at a target of your choice as a standard action. The ranged attack is made as if you had thrown the item unless it's ammunition for a weapon, in which case the attack is made as if fired from the appropriate weapon (arrows as from a composite longbow with a +2 Strength rating and a firearm pellet functions as a shuriken). You take the usual â€“4 penalty for throwing an improvised weapon if you launch an item not intended to be used as a weapon. The attack roll is made at +%1. Range increment and proficiency penalties apply as normal. The attack has an effective Strength bonus, if applicable, of %2. The spell is discharged when all touched items have been launched.|CasterLevel+max(INT,CHA)|max(INT,CHA)
