Craft Mount					KEY:Construct Rider ~ Craft Mount				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.ConstructRiderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Animal Companion			DEFINE:CompanionIsConstruct|0													SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:A construct rider assembles a construct mount shaped like a riding animal. A Medium alchemist can select a camel or a horse. A Small alchemist can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he's at least 4th level. The GM may approve other animals as mounts. &nl; This construct mount acts in most ways as a druid animal companion, using the character's alchemist level as his effective druid level. A construct mount is a construct, but uses the appropriate animal companion's statistics, gaining Hit Dice, skills, feats, and Strength and Dexterity adjustments as the alchemist advances in level. A construct mount has no Constitution score, and instead gains bonus hit points appropriate for a construct of its size. It has an Intelligence score (and skill points), a lower base attack bonus, and better saving throws than a normal construct of its Hit Dice. The mount has all the immunities of a construct (except immunity to mind-affecting effects, since it has a mind). A construct rider can use Craft (alchemy) instead of Handle Animal for all purposes involving his construct mount, though the check still takes a -5 penalty due to the construct mount's unusual nature. &nl; To create a construct with a mind and body that are constantly changing and improving, the construct rider must manufacture vast quantities of clockwork or animating reagents. As such, the construct rider can never gain the mutagen or cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class. &nl; At first, his mount is a singular masterpiece created during a momentary stroke of brilliance.

As a move action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, the construct mount can apply the potion or extract to itself. Refilling the reservoir is a complicated process that requires a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. Failure destroys the potion or extract. The process requires 1 minute, and provokes attacks of opportunity.

Loading the bomb requires the same process as loading an extract or potion. A construct mount loaded with a bomb can unleash it as a breath weapon in a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line as a standard action, dealing damage as a direct hit against all targets in the area of effect. The alchemist selects a line or cone area when loading the reservoir. Because the construct mount lacks the alchemist's Throw Anything ability, the alchemist's Intelligence bonus doesn't apply to this damage.

Material Mastery				KEY:Discovery ~ Material Mastery				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																								SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:Your superior knowledge of the nature of matter enables you to ignore spell requirements more easily when crafting magic items. By expending an extract of the same school and level as a spell prerequisite when crafting a magic item, you take only a -2 penalty for ignoring that requirement, instead of -5.
Spell Knowledge				KEY:Discovery ~ Spell Knowledge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																										SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:Your studies into how all things are interconnected have taught you to cast a very limited number of spells. Select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least 2 levels lower than your highest-level extract known. You can prepare and cast this spell as an arcane spell. Preparing the spell uses up an extract slot 1 level higher than the spell's level. Your caster level is equal to your alchemist level, and your save DCs and concentration checks are Intelligence-based. You're considered to have this spell on your spell list for purposes of prerequisites, spell completion items, and spell trigger items. You may select this discovery more than once. Each time, it grants you access to another spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.		MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLS|CLASSLIST=Wizard[LEVELMIN=0;LEVELMAX=MAXCASTABLE-2]
Syringe Stirge				KEY:Discovery ~ Syringe Stirge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural.AlchemistBombModifier														PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,6	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:As a full-round action, you can expend two daily uses of bombs to create a syringe stirge, a tiny construct primed with a bomb (if you have multiple types of bombs, you must select which type the syringe stirge carries when created). Undirected, they take no actions except to flock around you in your square and follow you as best they can. They can be attacked normally, but gain cover while occupying your square. As a swift action, you can order one of your syringe stirges to attack an enemy it can see. Once ordered to attack that enemy, the syringe stirge will continue to attack every round, attempting to attach and deliver its payload. &nl; A syringe stirge has all of the statistics of a stirge (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 260) but lacks the blood drain ability. If it ends its turn attached to an opponent, it injects your bomb into the opponent's bloodstream, dealing damage as a direct hit plus the alchemist's Intelligence modifier (as the Throw Anything feat - this injection is a direct attack and doesn't deal splash damage). A syringe stirge dies immediately after injecting its bomb. A syringe stirge lasts for 1 minute per alchemist level or until destroyed; if it has not attached to an enemy before the end of its life span it and its bomb payload fall inert.

Aide-De-Camp				KEY:Esquire ~ Aide-De-Camp					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.EsquireClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:An esquire acquires the services of a loyal aide-de-camp. This NPC functions similarly to a cohort, though the aide-de-camp must advance in a class that grants proficiency with all martial weapons and cannot multiclass until the esquire reaches 7th level (though the aide-de-camp can select an archetype). If the aide-de-camp is a cavalier, he must follow the same order as the esquire. &nl; The aide-de-camp gains Swift Aid (APG) as a bonus feat, and provides a +2 (rather than +1) bonus when using this feat to aid the esquire. As a move action, the aide-de-camp can retrieve a stored item or an item on the ground and hand it to the esquire. The esquire does not have to take an action to receive the item, though he must be conscious and have a free hand. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the aide-de-camp or esquire. &nl; If the aide-de-camp dies performing an act that directly supports the edicts of the esquire's order (GM's discretion), the esquire does not take a penalty to his Leadership score. If an aide-de-camp dies, or is released from the esquire's service, the esquire may gain a new aide-de-camp by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town. This requires 1 day per 5 levels of the aide-de-camp to be recruited. 
Teamwork					KEY:Esquire ~ Teamwork						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.EsquireClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:As long as an esquire and his aide-de-camp are adjacent, the aide-de-camp is treated as having any teamwork feats the esquire has. They also share any teamwork feats that function when two or more allies threaten the same target, as long as they both threaten the same target. 
Shared Challenge				KEY:Esquire ~ Shared Challenge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.EsquireClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:Whenever an esquire challenges an opponent when his aide-de-camp is within 30 feet, he may grant his aide-de-camp bonuses equal to one-half of the bonuses he gains from challenge, including bonuses derived from the cavalier's order. If the aide-de- camp is also a cavalier and challenges the same target, these bonuses do not stack. Like the esquire, his aide-de-camp takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class against attacks from creatures other than the challenged opponent.
Banner					KEY:Esquire ~ Banner						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.EsquireClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:An aide-de-camp can carry an esquire's banner for him and still grant allies within range the banner's bonuses. While doing so the aide-de-camp gains double the normal morale bonuses provided by the banner. This ability modifies banner.
Avenge Me					KEY:Esquire ~ Avenge Me						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.EsquireClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:Whenever the esquire is killed, dying, stunned, dazed, or otherwise unable to take actions, his aide-de-camp gains the full benefits of the esquire's challenge and order abilities against all creatures that attacked the esquire in the previous round. If the aide-de-camp is also a cavalier and challenges the same target, these bonuses do not stack. These benefits last until the esquire regains the ability to take actions, or until the aide-de-camp or the triggering opponents are killed. If his aide-de-camp is killed, dying, or otherwise unable to take actions the esquire may declare one creature of his choice that attacked the aide-de-camp in the past round as his quarry; this functions identically to the ranger class ability. These bonuses last until the aide-de-camp recovers or until the cavalier or the triggering opponents are killed.
Fight As One				KEY:Esquire ~ Fight As One					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.EsquireClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:The shared challenge ability increases in power, granting the aide-de-camp full benefit of the esquire's challenge. In addition, if the esquire and aide-de-camp both confirm a critical hit against the same target within the same round, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC %1) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.|10+CavalierLVL/2+CHA

Demand Attention				KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Demand Attention				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RogueTalent																										SOURCEPAGE:p.27	DESC:The first time each round that you deal sneak attack damage to an opponent, you can forgo sneak attack damage to distract the creature. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of sneak attack dice sacrificed + your Charisma modifier) or become distracted until the start of your next turn. Distracted opponents are entirely focused on you, and pay little attention to their surroundings; they are not considered to be observing other characters within 30 feet, allowing them to attempt Stealth checks to hide.

This has no effect on creatures you could not flank with that ally, even if the ally was properly positioned.

Apprentice					KEY:Instructor ~ Apprentice					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.InstructorClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																							SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:An instructor acquires the services of a loyal apprentice. She functions similarly to a cohort, though your apprentice begins as a 1st-level commoner with Magical Aptitude as their 1st-level feat and NPC ability scores (13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 before racial modifiers). When the instructor reaches 3rd level, if his Leadership score is at least 2, the apprentice becomes a 1st-level wizard of the same school specialization as the instructor, and she gains heroic ability scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 before racial modifiers). The apprentice never gains item creation feats, but otherwise follows the normal rules for a cohort. &nl; Each time the instructor gains a level, he may dismiss his existing apprentice as graduated (or expelled, depending on her performance), and gain a new cohort following the same rules. If an apprentice dies in service to the instructor, the instructor takes a -2 penalty to his Leadership score. This penalty is reduced by 1 for every level the instructor gains after the death, to a minimum of 0. &nl; Because cohorts are most interested in the instructor's magical ability, the instructor uses his Intelligence modifier, rather than Charisma, to determine his Leadership score. At 7th level, an instructor may select the Leadership feat-using his Intelligence modifier to determine his Leadership score-but doing so only provides followers, never a second cohort.
