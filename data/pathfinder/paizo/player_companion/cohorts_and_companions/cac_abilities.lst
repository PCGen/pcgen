(You need not wait until you have actually committed an act of betrayal.) You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks, increasing to +4 on checks specifically made to conceal or deny your infidelity. It is possible to regain the Tight Bonds trait, for either the same or a different relationship, but it requires substantial in-character work.
