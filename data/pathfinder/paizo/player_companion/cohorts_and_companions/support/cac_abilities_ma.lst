Binding Ritual		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Binding Ritual		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,3	DESC:You have learned the eldritch rituals required to draw creatures from the planes into your presence. If you are a spellcaster, you add the following spells to your list of spells known: binding, dimensional anchor, magic circle against chaos, magic circle against evil, magic circle against good, magic circle against law, planar binding, planar binding (greater), and planar binding (lesser). If these spells are not normally on your class list, you add them to your list of spells known at the level they appear on the sorcerer/wizard spell list, though you do not gain spells whose level exceeds the level of spells your class can cast. &nl; Whether or not you are a spellcaster, you can expend one use of your mythic power to create a magic circle (of any type) as part of a calling diagram; if you expend an additional use of your mythic power, this diagram is fortified with dimensional anchor. If you are at least 9th level, you may also spend two uses of your mythic power to cast lesser planar binding as a spell-like ability. If you are at least 11th level and 6th tier, you can expend three uses of your mythic power to cast planar binding as a spell-like ability. If you are at least 15th level and 9th tier, you can expend four uses of your mythic power to cast greater planar binding as a spell-like ability. For all these effects, treat your mythic tier as your caster level, unless your own caster level is higher.
