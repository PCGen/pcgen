Basic Harmony				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Teamwork		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Performance,TYPE.BardicPerformance																																										DESC:Your performance interweaves with and enriches your ally's skills.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.6	BENEFIT:You can attempt a DC 10 Perform check to aid the Perform check of an ally who also has this feat. If you succeed, your ally gains a +1 bonus for each 5 points of your check result; a check result of 10 grants a +2 bonus, a result of 15 grants a +3 bonus, and so on. If you fail, the discord applies a -5 penalty on your ally's check. Normal: Aid another checks grant a +2 bonus.
Blazing Channel				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Channel Positive Energy				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Turn Undead																																			DESC:Your holy power burns the undead like fire.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you use your Turn Undead feat, undead failing their saving throw are engulfed in holy fire. This functions identically to catching on fire (CRB 444), but the damage dealt is divine (like the divine damage from flame strike) rather than fire. Water cannot extinguish this holy fire, but any negative energy effect that heals the creature of at least 5 points of damage extinguishes the flames instantly.
Channel Surge				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Channel Positive Energy,TYPE.Channel Negative Energy,TYPE.Lay on Hands																																						DESC:You are a mighty conduit of sacred or profane power.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you channel energy or lay on hands, you may expend two uses of the ability as a full-round action to increase the amount of healing or damage you do by +50%%.
Charming Performance			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Performance,TYPE.BardicPerformance													PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=1	PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CHA,13																			DESC:Your musical skill, dramatic timing, or mastery of language make you seem more personable.														SOURCEPAGE:p.6	BENEFIT:You can use Perform, rather than Diplomacy, to improve an NPC's starting attitude toward you. Alternatively, by praising another character, you may use Perform to improve an NPC's starting attitude toward another character, though the DC for doing so is increased by 5. Either use of this feat requires at least 5 minutes of performance. You can't improve an NPC's attitude beyond friendly in this way, but if you would have made them helpful, you gain a +2 bonus on your next normal Diplomacy check against that NPC attempted within 24 hours. If the campaign uses the contact rules (Ultimate Campaign 148), seeing you perform can count as up to four of the five positive interactions required to cultivate a contact.
Charnel Soldiers				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Teamwork									PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Command Undead],[PRESPELL:1,Animate Dead,Control Undead,Create Undead,Create Greater Undead,Control Undead]																	DESC:The mindless undead you command fight together like seasoned warriors.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you create undead, they gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat, though they gain its benefits only when cooperating with you or with other undead that you have created. If you control undead with the Command Undead feat or a spell like command undead, they likewise gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat as long as they remain under your control. Intelligent undead gain no benefit from this feat.
Compelling Harmony			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Teamwork		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Performance,TYPE.BardicPerformance	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Basic Harmony						PRESKILL:1,Perform (Keyboard Instruments)=10,Perform (Percussion Instruments)=10,Perform (Sing)=10,Perform (String Instruments)=10,Perform (Wind Instruments)=10			DESC:Your harmonies reinforce and empower your allies' magic.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you may expend one round of bardic performance to boost the effectiveness of the bardic performance of an ally within 60 feet who also has this feat. Until the beginning of your next turn, if that ally uses a bardic performance that allows a saving throw, increase that saving throw DC by 2.
Counterpoint to Inspiration		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Teamwork		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Performance,TYPE.BardicPerformance	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Basic Harmony,Compelling Harmony			PRESKILL:1,Perform (Keyboard Instruments)=10,Perform (Percussion Instruments)=10,Perform (Sing)=10,Perform (String Instruments)=10,Perform (Wind Instruments)=10			DESC:As your allies' morale swells, your enemies falter.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:When an ally with this feat is within 60 feet and uses a bardic performance or raging song that grants allies a morale bonus or competence bonus, you may perform the same bardic performance or raging song to increase those bonuses by +1. This increase only lasts as long as you and your ally each maintain the same performance, and cannot be extended with effects like Lingering Performance. Additional bards with this feat beyond the second don't increase the bonuses further.
Grow Plant Creature			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:ItemCreation		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Train Plants									PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (nature)=5,Handle Animal=5																																		DESC:Through careful study and communion with nature, you have learned how to cultivate and raise plant creatures.										SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:You can grow plants and perform rituals to invest them with animating spirits, becoming assassin vines, treants, or viper vines. Each plant creature has a list of additional prerequisites, costs, and skill checks required to grow them (see Growing Plant Creatures p.20). At the GM's discretion, characters with this feat may grow other plant creatures as well.
Monstrous Companion			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Animal Companion,TYPE.Mount,TYPE.Special Mount													PRESKILL:1,Handle Animal=7	PREMULT:1,[PREVARGT:AnimalCompanionLVL,6],[PREVARGT:SpecialMountLVL,6],[PREVARGT:CavalierMountLVL,6],[PREVARGT:HunterAnimalCompanionLVL,6]	DESC:You have formed a bond with a creature far more exotic than an animal.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:You can select a magical beast as a cohort in place of your animal companion class feature (for more information on monster cohorts see Bestiary 316).
Recruits					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CHA,13	PRELEVEL:MIN=5																																																DESC:Be they students, retainers, new recruits to your order, or neophyte members of your faith, you have access to a small set of dedicated servants.				SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:You gain a number of cohorts (as the Leadership feat) that represent NPCs you are responsible for instructing and overseeing. You have a number of such cohorts equal to half your character level. Unlike normal cohorts, these minor cohorts must be at least 4 levels lower than your character level. Since these students must spend most of their time studying and gaining experience, you can only have one minor cohort travel with you at a time (though they all gain experience at the same rate, as those not present are assumed to be studying and growing independently). Whenever you are in a major town or city, you may exchange your current minor cohort for a different member of your recruits. As minor cohorts are busy learning and studying the basics of their careers, those not traveling with you cannot engage in mundane or magical crafting or Profession checks. Minor cohorts not traveling with you can serve as managers for your holdings if you are using downtime rules (Ultimate Campaign 88). If a minor cohort dies, you take only a -1 penalty to your Leadership score. [Special] Recruits counts as the Leadership feat for purposes of prerequisites. A character cannot have both Leadership and Recruits. A character with Recruits that later qualifies for Leadership may exchange this feat for Leadership immediately upon qualifying (selecting one minor cohort to become a full cohort, while the rest move on).

Rouse Emotions				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Performance,TYPE.BardicPerformance	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Charming Performance					PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=5																									DESC:You can sway the hearts of an entire crowd with your art, or turn them against your enemies.													SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:You can use Charming Performance on all creatures within 60 feet. In addition to swaying the crowd's starting attitude toward a single person, you may choose to sway the crowd's attitude toward a well-defined group with which they are familiar (such as a specific nation, organization, or religion). An attempt to rouse emotions about a group takes a -5 penalty due to the difficulty of creating strong feelings toward an entire group rather than a specific individual. The DC for this check is 30 + 1 for every five people in the crowd to be affected. You can't use Rouse Emotions to change a crowd's attitude by more than one step, or to make it helpful or hostile.
Secret Language				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Teamwork		PRESKILL:3,Bluff=1,Linguistics=1,Sense Motive=1																																																	DESC:You and your allies have worked out a complex set of codes and phrases that allow you to secretly pass information back and forth.							SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to pass secret messages to other characters that have this feat, and can communicate as much information as you could normally say in one round as a swift action.
Solar Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																										DESC:Your spells erupt with the searing light of the sun, blinding or burning creatures of evil.									ADDSPELLLEVEL:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Any spell you cast with the light descriptor is fortified with the cleansing energies of the sun. If the spell creates an area of light, all creatures are dazzled for as long as they remain within the spell's area. Oozes, fungal creatures, creatures from the Shadow Plane, and undead must also succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + the spell level + your Wisdom or Charisma bonus) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for as long as they remain within the spell's area. If the spell normally dazzles or blinds affected creatures with a duration other than instantaneous or permanent, the duration of that effect is increased by a number of rounds equal to the spell's original level. Saving throws to remove the effect early still apply and can bypass this increase. If the spell deals more damage against oozes, fungal creatures, creatures from the Shadow Plane, or undead with a specific vulnerability to sunlight, the spell deals 1 additional point of damage per die against such creatures. A solar spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
Train Plants				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (nature)=5,Handle Animal=5																																																	DESC:After years of practice, cautious experiments, or sheer stubbornness, you have gained the ability to teach unintelligent plant creatures to follow simple commands.	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:A character with this feat treats creatures of the plant type with Intelligence scores of 3 or lower as animals for the purposes of the Handle Animal skill. Plant creatures without an Intelligence score are treated as animals with an Intelligence of 1 for these purposes. Ordinary plants lack Wisdom and Charisma scores-they aren't creatures and can't be trained.
