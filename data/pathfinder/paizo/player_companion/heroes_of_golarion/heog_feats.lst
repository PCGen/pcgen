You must meet additional prerequisites to select a companion with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, as described in each creature's entry.
Beast Speaker Mastery		SOURCEPAGE:p.21	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																PREMULT:4,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Beast Speaker],[PREVARGTEQ:TL,BeastSpeakerMasteryPreLvl],[PREVARNEQ:BeastSpeakerMasteryPreLvl,0],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.BeastSpeakerCompanion]																																				DESC:Your magical beast has developed abilities that only its wild kin would normally have.																		BONUS:VAR|MasterHasBeastSpeakerMastery|1|TYPE=Boolean	BENEFIT:Your beast companion gains the abilities and bonuses listed in the mastery entry in its stat block. You must be of at least the indicated level for the companion to use these abilities, so if you dismiss a companion and gain a new beast companion of a different type, you retain the feat but might not yet be of sufficient level for the new companion to gain its mastery benefits.

BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can spend 1 grit point to convert your gun's damage into acid, fire, electricity, or cold damage for 1 round.

BENEFIT:While your gun is imbued with power from the Arcane Strike feat, you can spend a standard action to cast a spell of 3rd level or lower and deliver it via a force bullet. The spell must have a range of touch or produce a ray; if the spell would produce multiple rays, the bullet delivers the effect of only one ray. If the force bullet strikes a target, it deals its force damage and also delivers the effects of the spell. If the force bullet critically hits a target, the spell deals double damage.
Mental Stare			SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Stare		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare																																																																									DESC:Blind mesmerists have learned to navigate the world without relying on sight and can use their hypnotic stare regardless of their sight level.

BENEFIT:While your gun is imbued with power from the Arcane Strike feat, you can fire force bullets instead of regular ammunition.

###Block: Wyrwood Feats
# Ability Name	Source Page		Category of Ability	Type			Required Ability													Req. Att.	Required Race	Required Skill		Required Text			Description																Ability						Bonus to Situation						Benefits
Consume Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																		PRERACE:1,Wyrwood	PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=3						DESC:You can absorb magic items to gain a boost in power.																								BENEFIT:Once per day as a full-round action, you can consume a single magical item in your possession. The item is destroyed upon consumption, but you regain 1d6 hit points + 1 additional hit point per caster level of the item. You also gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to the caster level of the item.
Expressionless	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																		PRERACE:1,Wyrwood										DESC:Other races have difficulty reading your wooden features.														BONUS:SITUATION|Bluff=Dealing with non-Wyrwoods|2	BENEFIT:Your lack of emotion make it difficult for non-wyrwoods to relate to you. When dealing with any race other than your own, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, creatures of other races take a �"2 penalty on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks attempted against you.
Freeze in Place	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																			PRERACE:1,Wyrwood	PRESKILL:1,Stealth=5						DESC:You become an expert of hiding in plain sight.									ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Freeze										BENEFIT:You gain the freeze universal monster rule, allowing you to appear as an ordinary statue. If you attack a creature unaware of you while using this ability, you double your critical threat range. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of your attacks or weapons.
Ioun Resonance	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																		PRERACE:1,Wyrwood										DESC:You can create a magic link between your ioun heart and an ioun stone in your possession.																		BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can create a link between your ioun core and an active ioun stone you hold or carry. For as long as you gain the benefits of the linked stone, any numerical bonuses and penalties granted by the stone are increased by 1. You can maintain a link with only one ioun stoneat a time. Creating a link to a new stone ends any previous links.
Lifecrafting	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:ItemCreation	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Construct,Leadership									PRERACE:1,Wyrwood										DESC:Your crafting skill and the secret knowledge of your people allows you to create new wyrwoods.																	BENEFIT:By completing a unique ritual, you can create a wyrwood. While you can use any Small wooden construct to create the base of a wyrwood, infusing it with life and consciousness requires a specific process. The process requires a flawless ioun stone worth at least 10,000 gp. For the ritual to succeed, you must spend 1 month in complete isolation with the construct that will become a wyrwood. Each week, you must succeed at a DC 30 Craft (carpentry) or Craft (sculpture) check. Failure requires you to start again, although the materials can be reused. Over this time, the construct reshapes itself around the ioun stone until it finds the form it will take permanently — thus even non-humanoid constructs become humanoid as they become wyrwoods. While wyrwoods are born as fully formed adults, they lack any skill or training, so they have only 1 level in the commoner class.
Magical Heart	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Arcane Strike,Improved Unarmed Strike							PRERACE:1,Wyrwood										DESC:Through intense focus, your magical strikes reinforce your ioun heart.

BENEFIT:You can invest mental focus in your body rather than an implement. When you invest mental focus this way, you treat your body as an implement of any implement school you know. You do not gain the resonant power for the chosen school, but you treat your occultist level as 1 higher for the purposes of that school's focus powers. You can change which implement school is tied to your body when you invest your chosen implements for the day.
Sword's Shadow	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deft Hands									PREATT:7	PRERACE:1,Wyrwood										DESC:You attack with a second strike before your opponent can recover from the first.																			BENEFIT:When you successfully damage an enemy with the first attack of a full attack, you can attempt a Sleight of Hand check against that enemy's CMD as an immediate action.
