Blessed Claws	KEY:Holy Beast ~ Blessed Claws	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																					DESC:This ability functions as the shifter’s claws class feature, except the holy beast shifter’s default claws are long and thin, dealing piercing damage. At 3rd level, her claws are treated as one type of aligned weapon (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) within one step of her deity’s alignment in addition to ignoring DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. If multiple alignment components are available to the holy beast, she selects one; this choice cannot be changed later.

She gains the ranger’s favored enemy class feature, except she can select only an outsider type from the favored enemy table. The bonus against her favored enemy automatically increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, she can forgo gaining an additional shifter aspect to instead gain an additional outsider type as her favored enemy. Her bonuses from the favored enemy feature against new outsider types chosen in this way are equal to the bonus for the type chosen at 1st level.
