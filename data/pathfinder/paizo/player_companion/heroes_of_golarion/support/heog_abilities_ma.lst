Mythic Medium						KEY:Mythic Ability ~ Mythic Medium			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Ability.SpecialQuality														DESC:In a way, every medium gets a small taste of mythic power through the spirits they channel, each of which is tied closely to one of the six mythic paths. In rare cases, the spirits become taken with a particular medium and bestow upon him a greater portion of their power. When a medium first gains mythic power, he can do so normally, or he can tie his mythic power to the spirits he channels. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.	DESC:If he ties his mythic power to his spirits, then whenever he performs a seance, his mythic path changes to match the spirit he is channeling that day. This does not allow the medium to change which path abilities he has chosen for a given path. Instead, whenever he gains a new mythic path ability, he must select an ability for each mythic path, and he gains access to those abilities only when channeling the spirit associated with that path. Mediums who select this option cannot gain the Dual Path feat, and they cannot select universal path abilities.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Mythic Medium ~ Gain Mythic Powers Normally	DESC:Mediums who do not take this option tend to prefer the trickster path (sometimes referred to by mediums as the many-faced path).
