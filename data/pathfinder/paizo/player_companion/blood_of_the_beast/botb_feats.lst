##No way to enforce "racial bonus to Dexterity" for Graceful Athelete, Mobile Acrobat.

Cooperative Swarmer			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ratfolk ~ Swarming																																										PRETEXT:Swarming racial trait.																							DESC:You're a team player and help out those normally too large or clumsy to fight in close quarters with you.								SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:You can share a square with an ally your size or larger, even if your ally does not have the swarming racial trait. Neither you nor the creature you share a space with count as flanking your targets, but you gain a +2 shield bonus to AC while sharing a square with a larger ally. If you perform an aid another action to aid your ally's attack roll or AC, increase the bonus you provide by 1.
Cunning Killer				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRETOTALAB:2			PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=3,Knowledge (dungeoneering)=3,Knowledge (local)=3,Knowledge (nature)=3,Knowledge (planes)=3,Knowledge (religion)=3																						PRETEXT:Base attack bonus +2, Knowledge (arcana, dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks.										DESC:You mercilessly dispatch those creatures that you outwit.	DEFINE:CunningKillerMaxInt|0	DEFINE:CunningKillerLimit|0	DEFINE:CunningKillerBonus|0	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	BENEFIT:When you succeed at a Knowledge check to identify a creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or less, you gain a +%2 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature for %3 rounds.|CunningKillerMaxInt|CunningKillerBonus|INT																																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|CunningKillerMaxInt|MIN(12,CunningKillerLimit)	BONUS:VAR|CunningKillerLimit|MIN(INTSCORE-5,((BAB/4)*2)+2)	BONUS:VAR|CunningKillerBonus|MIN(4,(BAB/6)+1)
Empty Threats				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Bluff=5																																																PRETEXT:Bluff 5 ranks.																									DESC:You have a gift for making authentic-sounding threats you never intend to follow through on.										SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:You can use the Bluff skill to demoralize opponents in combat instead of Intimidate. You can attempt a Bluff check in place of an Intimidate check when using the Dazzling Display feat and feats that list Dazzling Display as a prerequisite. If you use the Bluff skill to demoralize, you cannot use it to feint until the beginning of your next turn, and vice versa.
Entwining Stare				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Stare	PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=7		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																																				PRETEXT:Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.																			DESC:Your painful stare makes your enemies easier to grab and constrict.														SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:When you trigger your painful stare to add damage to an attack with grab, the target takes a –4 penalty to its CMD against the grab's grapple combat maneuver attempt.
Graceful Athlete				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:2,Acrobatics=1,Climb=1	PRESIZEGT:T																																												PRETEXT:Acrobatics 1 rank, Climb 1 rank, Swim 1 rank, racial bonus to Dexterity.															DESC:You can use your lean, agile body to scale tall heights.																SOURCEPAGE:p.6	BENEFIT:Add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength bonus to Climb and Swim checks. If you have a Strength penalty, you must apply both your Strength penalty and your Dexterity modifier. This feat grants no benefit to creatures that already add their Dexterity modifier to Climb and Swim checks (such as all Tiny or smaller creatures).																																																																																							BONUS:SKILL|Climb,Swim|MAX(STR,DEX-STR)|PRESTAT:1,STR=10	BONUS:SKILL|Climb,Swim|DEX|!PRESTAT:1,STR=10
Human Guise					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.ChangeShape	PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Shapechanger																																				PRETEXT:Change shape ability, shapechanger subtype, must be able to change shape into a human or must have a true form that appears human.					DESC:You have the ability to perfectly emulate a human.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	BENEFIT:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] You count as both human and your race for the purpose of taking character options, such as archetypes, feats, spells, traits, and prestige classes. In addition, you count as human for all other effects whenever you would otherwise appear human. For instance, a +1 human bane arrow would deal additional damage to a kitsune with this feat while she was in her human form (as per change shape), but not in her true form.
Knotted Nets				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork		PRETOTALAB:1			PREWEAPONPROF:1,Net																																											PRETEXT:Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net), base attack bonus +1.																		DESC:You are capable of entangling far greater prey with the help of your allies.													SOURCEPAGE:p.11	BENEFIT:If you ready an attack with a net to entangle a creature when an ally of your size who also has this feat attempts to entangle that creature with a net, the two of you can entangle the creature as if you were one size category larger. The entangled creature can attempt to escape both nets as though they were a single net, using the lower of the nets' hit points, hardness (if any), and DCs to break or escape. Only you or your ally can attempt to control the entangled creature's movement with an opposed Strength check, but your ally grants you a +1 bonus on the check. If you work with three other allies of the same size who have this feat, you can entangle a creature as if you were two size categories larger. If you work with seven other allies in this way, you can instead entangle a creature as if you were three size categories larger.
Lovable Scoundrel				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:2,Bluff=1,Diplomacy=1					PRERACE:1,Tengu,RACESUBTYPE=Tengu																																				PRETEXT:Bluff 1 rank, Diplomacy 1 rank, tengu.																					DESC:You're charming enough that others assume your criminal inclinations are delightful quirks.										SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:If you fail a Bluff check to deceive, an Intimidate check to gain a target's cooperation, or a Sleight of Hand check to steal from another creature, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check against the same DC as a free action. If you succeed, your target assumes your actions were in jest or just some awkward tengu tradition, and its attitude toward you does not immediately worsen (though later actions can still shift its attitude toward hostile). You can use this feat only once per day per target.
Lucky						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Black Cat,Lucky Halfling	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Halfling ~ Halfling Luck],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Halfling ~ Adaptable Luck],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Catfolk ~ Cat's Luck]									PRETEXT:Black Cat or Lucky Halfling; must have a racial trait with “luck” in its name. A character with the Defiant Luck feat can ignore this feat's prerequisites.	DESC:Your luck-based abilities seem limitless.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.6	BENEFIT:You gain additional uses of your chosen luck-based feat.																																																																																																																																						ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Lucky Bonus ~ Defiant Luck Choice|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Defiant Luck		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Lucky Bonus ~ Black Cat|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Black Cat		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Lucky Bonus ~ Lucky Halfling|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Lucky Halfling
Mobile Acrobat				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																						PRETEXT:Racial bonus to Dexterity.																							DESC:You harness your acrobatic momentum to quickly propel yourself forward.														SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:When attempting an Acrobatics check that would reduce your speed, treat your base speed as 10 feet faster before making speed reductions.
Rat Stack					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ratfolk ~ Swarming		PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13																																			PRETEXT:Dex 13, swarming racial trait.																						DESC:You coordinate efficiently in tight spaces.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You can occupy the same square with up to two other creatures that also have this feat. If all participants also have the Tunnel Rat feat, up to four creatures can share the same space.
Rending Swarm				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Rat Stack	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ratfolk ~ Swarming		PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,15																												PRETEXT:Dex 15, Rat Stack, swarming racial trait.																				DESC:Together, you and your allies tear through enemies' defenses.															SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You gain a +1 bonus on all melee damage rolls for each allied creature you share a square with that also has this feat. If two or more allies sharing a square have this feat and hit the same adjacent creature in a round, they tear it in different directions, dealing additional damage at the end of the round. This rend attack deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + the highest Strength modifier of all qualifying allies in the same square who struck the target this round.
Shapechanging Savage			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREMULT:1,[PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.ChangeShape],[PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Shapechanger]],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape]		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Feint],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Vigilante Talent ~ Cunning Feint]	PRETEXT:Improved Feint or canny feint vigilante talent, change shape ability, shapechanger subtype.												DESC:You catch foes off guard when changing your shape.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	BENEFIT:Whenever you use your change shape ability to assume a new form or to return to your true form, you can attempt a Bluff check as a swift action to feint one opponent within 30 feet who witnessed your transformation. You take a –4 penalty on Bluff checks to feint an opponent who is aware that you are a shapechanger. You don't take the usual penalties for feinting a creature of a different type or a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 when feinting in this manner. [Special] A character with the wild shape class feature counts as having the change shape ability and shapechanger subtype for the purpose of meeting this feat's prerequisites. A character with wild shape can use this feat's benefit whenever she uses wild shape to assume a new form or return to her true form.
Squirming Pile				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ratfolk ~ Swarming		PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=5																																					PRETEXT:Acrobatics 5 ranks, swarming racial trait.																				DESC:Your body is easily lost in the muddy chaos of fighting as a swarm, making your vital areas difficult to target.							SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:While sharing a square with an ally who has this feat, you gain a 25%% chance of negating the additional damage from a successful critical hit or sneak attack; if you negate the damage, it is instead rolled normally. This negation chance doesn't stack with similar protection provided by any other source, such as the fortification armor special ability.
Startling Shapechange			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREMULT:1,[PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.ChangeShape],[PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Shapechanger]],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape]		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dazzling Display															PRETEXT:Dazzling Display, change shape ability, shapechanger subtype.																	DESC:You use your shapechanging abilities in order to demoralize your enemies.													SOURCEPAGE:p.13	BENEFIT:You abruptly change shape, startling those who aren't prepared for your reveal. Whenever you use your change shape ability to assume a new form or return to your true form, you can also use Dazzling Display as a free action. Reduce the result of your Intimidate check by 5 against opponents who know that you are a shapechanger. When using Dazzling Display in this manner, you can use the feat without needing a weapon in hand. [Special] A character with the wild shape class feature counts as having the change shape ability and shapechanger subtype for the purpose of meeting this feat's prerequisites. A character with wild shape can use this feat's benefit whenever she uses wild shape to assume a new form or return to her true form.
Underfoot					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ratfolk ~ Swarming		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge																																			PRETEXT:Dodge, swarming racial trait.																						DESC:You clamber in and around your enemies' personal space to devastating effect.													SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Benefit: You are able to share a space with a hostile creature at least one size category larger than you. You gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC while occupying an opponent's space, as well as a +2 bonus on all attack rolls against the creature whose space you share. Creatures you share a square with take a –2 penalty on all concentration checks. Entering a space occupied by an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity. This ability does not stack with similar abilities providing a creature benefits for being in another creature's space, such as a mouser swashbuckler's underfoot attack deed. Special: This feat counts as the Disruptive feat for the purpose of qualifying for other feats that have Disruptive as a prerequisite.																					SERVESAS:ABILITY=FEAT|Disruptive
Venomous Stare				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Stare	PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=11		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																																				PRETEXT:Mesmerist level 11th, painful stare class feature.																			DESC:Your stare is toxic to your enemies.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:When you trigger your painful stare, the target immediately becomes envenomed by the following poison: painful stare—injury; save Fort DC %1; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex; cure 2 saves. Whether your target succeeds at or fails its save, you can't use Venomous Stare against that particular foe for 24 hours.|10+(MesmeristLVL/2)+CHA
