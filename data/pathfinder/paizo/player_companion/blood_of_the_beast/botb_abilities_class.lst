####Shared Seance was included because it apperars to be a sub-ability tied to Spirit (mentioned in the main Spirit description in OA). Taboo was included because taboos were mentioned in Spirit description in BotB description. No errata or support available at this time to confirm or refute these assumptions.
Spirit												KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Spirit														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		DEFINE:ProwlerSpiritBonus|0	DEFINE:ProwlerSpiritHideLocation|0																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:A prowler at world's end serves as a vessel to channel spirits-astral echoes of powerful souls from ages past that live on in myth and legend. Each day, a prowler at world's end can channel a spirit through a ritual known as a seance. Seances take 1 hour to perform and require the prowler at world's end's concentration. At the end of a seance, the prowler at world's end invites a local spirit to inhabit him and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one of four legends. Though the prowler at world's end can choose the legend to which the spirit he channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their legends. The prowler at world's end gains the spirit's listed seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours.	DESC:The prowler at world's end also gains the spirit's intermediate spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:BloodragerLVL,8	DESC:, and its greater spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:BloodragerLVL,16	DESC:. After 24 hours, the prowler at world's end loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform another seance. A prowler at world's end can invite his allies to participate in his seance-shared seance and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike the prowler at world's end, other participating characters can take other actions during this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can participate in a seance. In addition to granting power to the prowler at world's end, a channeled spirit can influence the prowler at world's end. By channeling a spirit, the prowler at world's end allows the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the prowler at world's end loses that 1 point of influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before the next seance, the spirit's influence over the prowler at world's end resets to 0. Certain abilities allow the prowler at world's end to gain additional power in exchange for allowing the spirit more influence over him. When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the prowler at world's end, the dual impulses housed within the same body cause the prowler at world's end to meld with his spirit's consciousness. The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the prowler at world's end to take a -2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific additional penalty. However, the spirit's mental presence grants the prowler at world's end a +4 bonus against possession effects and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are not related to possession. If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the prowler at world's end, the prowler at world's end completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. During his seance, the prowler at world's end can choose to channel a weaker spirit to gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so, he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the prowler at world's end can use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence.

This can cause the check to succeed instead of fail. The prowler at world's end must be conscious and aware to use this ability, and he can use this ability at most once per round.

All allies who participate in the prowler at world's end's seance gain the channeled spirit's seance boon for 24 hours.

Taboo													KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Taboo														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				DESC:During his daily seance, a prowler at world's end can accept a taboo in order to appease his spirit. Each spirit lists example taboos, and the GM may allow additional taboos as well. Accepting a taboo allows the prowler at world's end to use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence. The prowler at world's end can select only a single taboo. The prowler at world's end is not magically prevented from breaking his taboo, but if he breaks the taboo for any reason, he takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 hour and his spirit gains 1 point of influence over him. If the prowler at world's end continues violating the taboo while taking the penalty, the duration of the penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the prowler at world's end. If a spirit attains 5 points of influence because of a violated taboo, instead of possessing the prowler at world's end, the spirit leaves the prowler at world's end's body entirely, and the prowler at world's end loses access to his spirit powers, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities until the next time he can perform a seance. Banishing a spirit in this way damages the prowler at world's end's connection to that spirit's legend; the prowler at world's end cannot channel spirits of that legend for 1 week, and the next time the prowler at world's end channels a spirit of that legend, it starts with 2 points of influence over him instead of 1.

He must assume the form of a great cat of the same kind as a channeled spirit (cheetah, leopard, lion, or tiger). This effect lasts for as long as the prowler continues bloodraging, regardless of its normal duration, and using it does not consume a spell slot.

This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week. Finally, once per day, the first mother's fang can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the first mother's fang must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the first mother's fang (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger.|CavalierLVL/2|CavalierLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													BONUS:SITUATION|Diplomacy=Gather Information|CavalierLVL/2

This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends and air of menace while facing down his enemies. A first mother's fang can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village if using settlement statistics). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week, all NPCs treat their starting attitude toward him as one category better, as long as their initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the Diplomacy skills on pages 93-94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). While he gains renown, he also spreads rumors and tales about himself. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate skill checks. This bonus applies only while he is within %1 miles of the community in which he has gained renown. A first mother's fang can hold renown in only a limited number of communities (one or possibly two at higher levels). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These bonuses and abilities are subject to GM approval.

For example, the poison darter can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab.
Celestial Poisons											KEY:Discovery ~ Celestial Poisons														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoisonDarterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.PoisonDarterDiscoveryChoice																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:The poison darter is able to infuse poisons with celestial power so they can affect evil creatures that are normally immune to poison. Any poison the poison darter administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its save, the poison acts as normal, but may have no effect on the creature, depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing Constitution damage to undead).
Malignant Poison											KEY:Discovery ~ Malignant Poison														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoisonDarterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.PoisonDarterDiscoveryChoice																																																																																																																																																																																																																												PREVARGTEQ:RangerLVL,10																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:As a full-round action, the poison darter can increase the save DC of any poison by 4 and increase its duration by 2 frequency increments (for example, large scorpion venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6 and drow poison lasts 4 minutes instead of 2). Additionally, malignant poisons take effect immediately and do not have an onset time. This alchemical change lasts until the poison's extended duration ends or for %1 minutes, whichever comes first. After that, the poison reverts back to its original state.|RangerLVL

Furious Paint											KEY:War Painter ~ Furious Paint														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skald Class Feature.War Painter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:By spending 10 minutes preparing and applying special paints to his or an ally's skin, a war painter can create patterns that store the effects of one of his raging songs. The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter's ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos) but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint's effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action. A war painter can apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering Song feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint at a time. This ability modifies the raging song class feature and does not prevent a war painter from performing other raging songs.

This grants the painted ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious paints. The war painter does not need to know the rage power, but it must be one for which he qualifies. Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 80) or a totem rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 74). If the war painter already has a different blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite. He can apply this ability multiple times to the same creature, though only to give it rage powers that use the granted rage power as a prerequisite (such as beast totem and greater beast totem).

The spell ends when the paint's other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast.

Obscurity												KEY:Social Talent ~ Obscurity															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																							!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Obscurity	!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Celebrity Discount,Social Talent ~ Celebrity Perks,Social Talent ~ Great Renown,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown,Social Talent ~ Instant Recognition,Social Talent ~ Renown																																																																																																																																																					SERVESAS:ABILITY=Special Ability|Social Talent ~ Renown																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:The vigilante is relatively unknown socially. In fact, he makes a point of keeping the life of his social identity as ordinary as possible. This social talent functions exactly as the renown social talent, but instead of improving the starting attitude of all NPCs within the community, it empowers the vigilante so that he no longer needs to succeed at Disguise checks to appear as his social identity while assuming that identity within his area of obscurity. He still has to attempt Disguise checks when NPCs within this settlement are confronted with indisputable proof that the vigilante could be more than he appears to be, such as when he uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity. This social talent counts as renown for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of social talents that list renown as a prerequisite and can be improved by such talents. A vigilante with this talent cannot select renown, nor can he select any social talent that requires him to be famous (such as celebrity discount or celebrity perks).

The vigilante adds his seamless guise bonus to the bonus on Disguise checks that he gains to assume the shape of another creature with a polymorph spell or effect.

Transformation Sequence										KEY:Social Talent ~ Transformation Sequence												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																							!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Transformation Sequence																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:The vigilante's transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. The vigilante can complete the switch between his identities in 5 rounds, improving to a standard action if he has the quick change social talent, and to a swift action if he has the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation causes quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions. A vigilante can select this talent only if he is able to cast spells or spell-like abilities (this needn't be from his vigilante class). A vigilante with the magical child archetype effectively gets this social talent for free at 1st level.

Brutal Maneuver											KEY:Vigilante Talent ~ Brutal Maneuver													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Vigilante Talent ~ Brutal Maneuver																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									DESC:The first time each round that the vigilante uses a weapon, including a natural attack or unarmed strike, to perform a combat maneuver in place of making an attack (such as by performing a disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver in place of making a melee attack), he can choose to take a -5 penalty on all his attack rolls during the round. If he does so and succeeds at his combat maneuver check, the vigilante deals damage to the target of his combat maneuver as if he had hit that target with a normal hit from his weapon.

He can take a -4 penalty on his check in order to inflict two different conditions on his foe if he succeeds at his check. If the vigilante is successful, the target can remove both conditions as a standard action. A vigilante must have Greater Dirty Trick and Improved Dirty Trick in order to select this vigilante talent.

Racial Paragon											KEY:Vigilante Talent ~ Racial Paragon													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Vigilante Talent ~ Racial Paragon																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									DESC:The vigilante can take a move action to gain the benefit of a feat with a racial prerequisite he meets but doesn't have. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The vigilante must meet all the feat's prerequisites. He can use this ability %1 times per day. The vigilante can use this ability again before the duration expires to replace a previous racial feat with another choice. If a feat temporarily gained in this way has a daily use limitation, any uses of that feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit. This vigilante talent can be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected after the first, the vigilante can use this ability to gain the benefits of one additional racial feat at the same time, or to reduce the action required to activate this talent by one step (a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes an immediate action). If the vigilante chooses to gain the benefits of multiple feats, the feats selected must share the same racial prerequisite. He can use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of a second feat; doing so means he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.|MAX(4,(VigilanteLVL/2)+3)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.15

While they lack any ability to truly eliminate bad luck, they are uniquely gifted at making others believe otherwise. Many of these ancient traditions have been forgotten as tengus spread across the world and assimilated into other cultures, but a rare few tengus still practice this curious art of misdirection and dealing in ill fortune. A jinx witch's patron is normally Deception, Shadow, or Trickery.

Jinx-Eating												KEY:Jinx Witch ~ Jinx-Eating															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.Jinx Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:A jinx witch learns to absorb (or "eat") antagonistic magical effects targeting her. If a jinx witch succeeds at a Will or Fortitude saving throw that negates a hostile spell effect, she can consume the spell energy as an immediate action. The witch treats her caster level as 1 higher when casting the next prepared spell she casts after eating a jinx in this manner. If the spell cast is of the same school as the eaten spell, the witch instead treats her caster level as 2 higher. A jinx witch can store only one eaten spell at a time, and can use this ability %1 times each day. If the jinx witch uses this ability to eat a spell that targets more than one creature or that creates an area of effect, it uses 2 of her daily uses of the ability and all other targets or creatures in the area of effect receive a +2 bonus on their respective saving throws. If the jinx witch does not use the bonus provided by an eaten spell within 1 hour, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.|3+INT																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.25

She cannot affect the spell with metamagic or other effects that would change its effective spell level.

If the eaten spell is not on her spell list or is of a spell level higher than the witch is capable of casting herself, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order to cast it; failing this check results in the loss of the spell-like ability with no effect.
