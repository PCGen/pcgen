Spirit									KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Spirit							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																							DEFINE:ProwlerSpiritBonus|0	DEFINE:ProwlerSpiritHideLocation|0					DESC:A prowler at world's end serves as a vessel to channel spirits-astral echoes of powerful souls from ages past that live on in myth and legend. Each day, a prowler at world's end can channel a spirit through a ritual known as a seance. Seances take 1 hour to perform and require the prowler at world's end's concentration. At the end of a seance, the prowler at world's end invites a local spirit to inhabit him and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one of four legends. Though the prowler at world's end can choose the legend to which the spirit he channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their legends. The prowler at world's end gains the spirit's listed seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours.	DESC:The prowler at world's end also gains the spirit's intermediate spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:BloodragerLVL,8	DESC:, and its greater spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:BloodragerLVL,16	DESC:. After 24 hours, the prowler at world's end loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform another seance. A prowler at world's end can invite his allies to participate in his seance-shared seance and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike the prowler at world's end, other participating characters can take other actions during this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can participate in a seance. In addition to granting power to the prowler at world's end, a channeled spirit can influence the prowler at world's end. By channeling a spirit, the prowler at world's end allows the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the prowler at world's end loses that 1 point of influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before the next seance, the spirit's influence over the prowler at world's end resets to 0. Certain abilities allow the prowler at world's end to gain additional power in exchange for allowing the spirit more influence over him. When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the prowler at world's end, the dual impulses housed within the same body cause the prowler at world's end to meld with his spirit's consciousness. The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the prowler at world's end to take a -2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific additional penalty. However, the spirit's mental presence grants the prowler at world's end a +4 bonus against possession effects and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are not related to possession. If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the prowler at world's end, the prowler at world's end completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. During his seance, the prowler at world's end can choose to channel a weaker spirit to gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so, he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the prowler at world's end can use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence.

Spirit Surge								KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Spirit Surge						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																						DESC:After failing a d20 roll that was modified by his spirit bonus, a prowler at world's end can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him in order to add 1d6 to the check's result without taking an action. This can cause the check to succeed instead of fail. The prowler at world's end must be conscious and aware to use this ability, and he can use this ability at most once per round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Shared Seance								KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Shared Seance					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																						DESC:A prowler at world's end can share his channeled spirit's aid with his allies. All allies who participate in the prowler at world's end's seance gain the channeled spirit's seance boon for 24 hours.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Taboo										KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Taboo							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																						DESC:During his daily seance, a prowler at world's end can accept a taboo in order to appease his spirit. Each spirit lists example taboos, and the GM may allow additional taboos as well. Accepting a taboo allows the prowler at world's end to use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence. The prowler at world's end can select only a single taboo. The prowler at world's end is not magically prevented from breaking his taboo, but if he breaks the taboo for any reason, he takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 hour and his spirit gains 1 point of influence over him. If the prowler at world's end continues violating the taboo while taking the penalty, the duration of the penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the prowler at world's end. If a spirit attains 5 points of influence because of a violated taboo, instead of possessing the prowler at world's end, the spirit leaves the prowler at world's end's body entirely, and the prowler at world's end loses access to his spirit powers, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities until the next time he can perform a seance. Banishing a spirit in this way damages the prowler at world's end's connection to that spirit's legend; the prowler at world's end cannot channel spirits of that legend for 1 week, and the next time the prowler at world's end channels a spirit of that legend, it starts with 2 points of influence over him instead of 1.

Chosen of the Spirits							KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Chosen of the Spirits				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																						DESC:Whenever a prowler at world's end enters a bloodrage, he can apply the effects of beast shape IV to himself instead of using greater bloodrage or mighty bloodrage to apply the effects of a bloodrager spell to himself. He must assume the form of a great cat of the same kind as a channeled spirit (cheetah, leopard, lion, or tiger). This effect lasts for as long as the prowler continues bloodraging, regardless of its normal duration, and using it does not consume a spell slot.

Shapeshifted Spellcasting						KEY:Prowler at World's End ~ Shapeshifted Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Feature.Prowler at Worlds End Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																						DESC:The prowler at world's end can cast spells while under the effects of chosen of the spirits.

You never count as an ally for the purpose of gaining benefits from another creature's abilities, nor do you count as a willing target for spells. Anyone attempting to target you with a touch range spell, even a beneficial spell, must succeed at a melee touch attack, though you need not attempt saving throws against harmless spells. You gain no benefit from another creature's aid another attempts, as you are too busy making sure they aren't secretly tricking or sabotaging you.

Any poison the poison darter administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its save, the poison acts as normal, but may have no effect on the creature, depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing Constitution damage to undead).

Additionally, malignant poisons take effect immediately and do not have an onset time. This alchemical change lasts until the poison's extended duration ends or for %1 minutes, whichever comes first. After that, the poison reverts back to its original state.|RangerLVL

Furious Paint											KEY:War Painter ~ Furious Paint						CATEGORY:Special Ability			TYPE:Skald Class Feature.War Painter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:By spending 10 minutes preparing and applying special paints to his or an ally's skin, a war painter can create patterns that store the effects of one of his raging songs. The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter's ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos) but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint's effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action. A war painter can apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering Song feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint at a time. This ability modifies the raging song class feature and does not prevent a war painter from performing other raging songs.

Thousand Totems											KEY:War Painter ~ Thousand Totems						CATEGORY:Special Ability			TYPE:Skald Class Feature.War Painter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:A war painter can channel a powerful totem into his furious paints while applying the pigments on an ally. This grants the painted ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious paints. The war painter does not need to know the rage power, but it must be one for which he qualifies. Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 80) or a totem rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 74). If the war painter already has a different blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite. He can apply this ability multiple times to the same creature, though only to give it rage powers that use the granted rage power as a prerequisite (such as beast totem and greater beast totem).

Once while benefiting from the paint's raging song, the painted ally can use a standard action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it. The spell ends when the paint's other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally, even if its range is personal.

In fact, he makes a point of keeping the life of his social identity as ordinary as possible. This social talent functions exactly as the renown social talent, but instead of improving the starting attitude of all NPCs within the community, it empowers the vigilante so that he no longer needs to succeed at Disguise checks to appear as his social identity while assuming that identity within his area of obscurity. He still has to attempt Disguise checks when NPCs within this settlement are confronted with indisputable proof that the vigilante could be more than he appears to be, such as when he uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity. This social talent counts as renown for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of social talents that list renown as a prerequisite and can be improved by such talents. A vigilante with this talent cannot select renown, nor can he select any social talent that requires him to be famous (such as celebrity discount or celebrity perks).

SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Transformation Sequence						KEY:Social Talent ~ Transformation Sequence								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																												!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Transformation Sequence																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:The vigilante's transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. The vigilante can complete the switch between his identities in 5 rounds, improving to a standard action if he has the quick change social talent, and to a swift action if he has the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation causes quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions. A vigilante can select this talent only if he is able to cast spells or spell-like abilities (this needn't be from his vigilante class). A vigilante with the magical child archetype effectively gets this social talent for free at 1st level.

Brutal Maneuver							KEY:Vigilante Talent ~ Brutal Maneuver									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Vigilante Talent ~ Brutal Maneuver																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:The first time each round that the vigilante uses a weapon, including a natural attack or unarmed strike, to perform a combat maneuver in place of making an attack (such as by performing a disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver in place of making a melee attack), he can choose to take a -5 penalty on all his attack rolls during the round. If he does so and succeeds at his combat maneuver check, the vigilante deals damage to the target of his combat maneuver as if he had hit that target with a normal hit from his weapon.

He can take a -4 penalty on his check in order to inflict two different conditions on his foe if he succeeds at his check. If the vigilante is successful, the target can remove both conditions as a standard action. A vigilante must have Greater Dirty Trick and Improved Dirty Trick in order to select this vigilante talent.

Racial Paragon							KEY:Vigilante Talent ~ Racial Paragon									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Vigilante Talent ~ Racial Paragon																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:The vigilante can take a move action to gain the benefit of a feat with a racial prerequisite he meets but doesn't have. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The vigilante must meet all the feat's prerequisites. He can use this ability %1 times per day. The vigilante can use this ability again before the duration expires to replace a previous racial feat with another choice. If a feat temporarily gained in this way has a daily use limitation, any uses of that feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit. This vigilante talent can be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected after the first, the vigilante can use this ability to gain the benefits of one additional racial feat at the same time, or to reduce the action required to activate this talent by one step (a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes an immediate action). If the vigilante chooses to gain the benefits of multiple feats, the feats selected must share the same racial prerequisite. He can use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of a second feat; doing so means he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.|MAX(4,(VigilanteLVL/2)+3)	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.15

If a jinx witch succeeds at a Will or Fortitude saving throw that negates a hostile spell effect, she can consume the spell energy as an immediate action. The witch treats her caster level as 1 higher when casting the next prepared spell she casts after eating a jinx in this manner. If the spell cast is of the same school as the eaten spell, the witch instead treats her caster level as 2 higher. A jinx witch can store only one eaten spell at a time, and can use this ability %1 times each day. If the jinx witch uses this ability to eat a spell that targets more than one creature or that creates an area of effect, it uses 2 of her daily uses of the ability and all other targets or creatures in the area of effect receive a +2 bonus on their respective saving throws.

Jinx-Feast								KEY:Jinx Witch ~ Jinx-Feast											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.Jinx Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:When the jinx witch uses her jinx-eating ability, she also gains the ability to cast the eaten spell as a spell-like ability, using her witch level as her caster level and her Intelligence modifier to determine the spell-like ability's saving throw DC. If the eaten spell is not on her spell list or is of a spell level higher than the witch is capable of casting herself, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order to cast it; failing this check results in the loss of the spell-like ability with no effect.
