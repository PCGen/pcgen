Ancestor				KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Ancestor		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Whether created by bonding with the soul of a petitioner that was the summoner's ancestor in life or calling upon the impressions of such a soul left behind on the Ethereal Plane or the Akashic Record, ancestor eidolons are outsiders cast in the mold of mortals, and exhibit extraordinary skill and talent. They usually appear as idealized versions of the bodies they possessed while still alive, but distinctive and proud. Ancestor eidolons lend whatever aid they can to their summoner, who typically has some form of familial connection with the eidolon, be it by blood, honor, or devotion. The humanoid appearance of an ancestor eidolon retains fantastical elements that clearly mark it as a supernatural creature.

Eidolon Progession Lv.1		KEY:Ancestor ~ Unchained Eidolon LVL01	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AncestorLVL1		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 1st level, an ancestor eidolon gains all of the racial traits associated with its summoner's race; a summoner who isn't a 0-Hit Die creature must choose one 0-Hit Die race of his choice from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. For any effect dependent on class level, an ancestor eidolon uses its total Hit Dice instead (such as with the human's skilled racial trait). An ancestor eidolon counts as a creature of its chosen race's type and subtype for all effects, except for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisite requirements. An ancestor eidolon gains only the standard racial traits of its race; it cannot select alternate racial traits. Do not apply racial adjustments to ability scores, speed, size, or languages. An ancestor eidolon cannot take feats or other abilities that would circumvent the archetype's restriction on qualifying for feats based on race.
Eidolon Progession Lv.4		KEY:Ancestor ~ Unchained Eidolon LVL04	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AncestorLVL4		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 4th level, the ancestor eidolon chooses one of the following simple class templates (Monster Codex 246): fighter, rogue, or sorcerer. It gains the abilities noted under the template's quick rules as if it were a creature with 1 Hit Die. The eidolon does not gain any abilities that a character with 1 level in the class associated with the chosen template wouldn't have. For instance, a 1-HD creature with the rogue simple template would normally gain the evasion and uncanny dodge abilities, but an ancestor eidolon that chooses the rogue simple template does not gain these abilities since a 1st-level rogue would not have evasion or uncanny dodge. Instead of gaining a +4 bonus to a specific ability score at 4th level, an ancestor eidolon gains the ability increase evolution for that ability score at 4th level. Ancestor eidolons with the rogue template gain 1d6 sneak attack at 4th level instead of rounding down "a number of sneak attack dice equal to 1/2 its HD" as specified in the rogue template to 0 dice of sneak attack.
Eidolon Progession Lv.8		KEY:Ancestor ~ Unchained Eidolon LVL08	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AncestorLVL8		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 8th level, the ancestor eidolon gains the skilled evolution with two skills that are on the list of class skills of the class associated with the eidolon's chosen simple class template. The eidolon gains the evolution a second time for the same ability score at 8th level that it received at 4th level.
Eidolon Progession Lv.12	KEY:Ancestor ~ Unchained Eidolon LVL12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AncestorLVL12		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 12th level, the ancestor eidolon gains the abilities noted under its chosen simple class templates as if it were a creature with 5 Hit Dice, rather than 1 Hit Die. The eidolon doesn't gain any abilities that a character with 5 levels in the class associated with the chosen template wouldn't have.
Eidolon Progession Lv.16	KEY:Ancestor ~ Unchained Eidolon LVL16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AncestorLVL16		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 16th level, the ancestor eidolon gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Toughness, or any feat that lists the eidolon's chosen race as a prerequisite. The eidolon must meet all of the chosen feat's prerequisites.
Eidolon Progession Lv.20	KEY:Ancestor ~ Unchained Eidolon LVL20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AncestorLVL20		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 20th level, the ancestor eidolon gains the abilities noted under its chosen simple class templates as if it were a creature with 10 Hit Dice, rather than 5 Hit Dice. The eidolon doesn't gain any abilities that a character with 10 levels in the class associated with the chosen template wouldn't have.
