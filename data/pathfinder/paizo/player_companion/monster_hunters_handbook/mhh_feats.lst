SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You can attempt a Craft or Heal check to craft a special type of trophy called an ornament from part of a creature that's been dead for less than an hour. You take a -4 penalty on this check if you or an ally didn't slay the creature. You can craft one ornament per character level per day. Each corpse provides enough material for one ornament plus one additional ornament per size category above Medium. You can wear one ornament in each magic item slot not already occupied by another item. When you craft an ornament, you choose whether it affects Armor Class, attack rolls, CMB, CMD, saving throws, or skill checks. The ornament provides a morale bonus equal to the monster's CR divided by 4 (round down, minimum 1) to the selected statistic against creatures of the same creature type as the source of the ornament. This bonus increases by 1 against creatures of the exact same variety (so a red dragon's talon provides the increased bonus against red dragons but not all dragons). An ornament remains effective for 1 day, plus 1 additional day for every 5 by which you exceed the DC to craft it. You can give ornaments to others, but gifted ornaments have a morale bonus equal to the monster's CR divided by 6 (round down, minimum 0) and remain effective for only 24 hours.

Only creatures with a CR of 1 or higher yield usable parts. The value of the parts you harvest is equal to the creature's CR squared x 10 gp (increases to CR derived from class levels or templates do not contribute to this value). This value can be used only as raw materials for crafting alchemical, masterwork, mundane, or magic items. Items crafted using creature parts must be made of a suitable material-typically bone or hide, with metal only in extraordinary cases. No more than a quarter of a crafted item's cost can be supplied with harvested parts. Harvested parts remain usable for 2 days before they rot (unless used to craft objects or somehow preserved). Creature parts that are harvested in this manner can't be bought or sold in most settlements.

SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:Your bonus to AC from the Dodge feat increases to +2 against charge attacks. When a creature charges you and misses with its attack, it loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against the next melee attack you make against it before the end of your next turn. If a creature misses with multiple attacks (such as when using the pounce ability), you can make one such attack against the creature's flat-footed AC before the end of your next turn for each of that creature's attacks that missed you.

If you have 10 or more ranks in the selected Knowledge skill, you can learn two fewer pieces of information to increase this bonus to +5. [Special] You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, you must select a different Knowledge skill.

Monstrous Crafter					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wondrous Item,Grisly Ornament,Harvest Parts																																																																				DESC:You can weave pieces of beasts into your magic items.												SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:Whenever you use the Grisly Ornament feat, you are able to permanently integrate one ornament you have crafted using the harvested creature parts into a wondrous item. The ornament grants no ongoing benefits, but once per day you can activate an integrated ornament as a free action to gain its full benefits for 1 minute. You can integrate an ornament into a wondrous item (or replace an item's existing ornament) by spending 8 hours of work and 100 gp x the creature's CR.
Monstrous Disguise				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																PRESKILL:2,Disguise=5,Knowledge (nature)=5																																										DESC:You can disguise yourself as a monstrous humanoid.												SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:You can use the Disguise skill to emulate creatures of the monstrous humanoid type, at a -5 penalty. Creating a monstrous humanoid disguise takes 1d3 hours.
Monstrous Masquerade				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Monstrous Disguise																								PRESKILL:2,Disguise=9,Knowledge (nature)=9																																										DESC:When you disguise yourself as a monstrous humanoid, you can gain some of its qualities.						SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you use the Monstrous Disguise feat to assume the shape of a monstrous humanoid, you can gain a rudimentary version of one of that creature's abilities selected from the following list: climb 10 feet, fly 20 feet (clumsy maneuverability), swim 20 feet, damage reduction 3/magic, or resistance 5 to one energy type. Preparing a disguise in this way takes 1 additional hour and costs an extra 500 gp. The bonus ability granted by this feat has a 25%% chance to cease functioning every hour after you apply the disguise. This disguise automatically falls apart after 8 hours.
Needle in a Haystack				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Skill Focus (Perception)																							PRESKILL:1,Perception=3																																														DESC:Once you have even the trace of a creature you're tracking, you can't be thrown off the trail.

If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception, this bonus increases to +4.
Pacify Animal					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Empathy																																																																								DESC:You are able to calm rampaging animals.														SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you attempt to mollify an animal or magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 and an attitude of hostile toward you or your allies. You attempt a wild empathy check (DC = 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Charisma modifier). If you succeed, the target's attitude toward you and your allies becomes indifferent for 1 minute, and it does not attack during this time. If the target is attacked during this time or if the target can see you or your allies after 1 minute, it becomes hostile again. A creature can be affected by this pacification attempt only once in a 24-hour period. &nl; [Special] Animal companions and creatures under magical compulsion are harder to pacify; the DC for such creatures equals 15 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Charisma modifier. An animal companion also applies its bonus on Will saves from the devotion ability to this DC, and attacking the animal's master also breaks this effect. An animal companion's master can direct the animal to attack again, but the DC of this Handle Animal check is increased by your wild empathy modifier.
Punishing Step					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge													PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13],[PREVARGTEQ:FeatDexRequirement,13]																																																		DESC:You can hurt a foe that uses a combat maneuver against you.

SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:When a creature hits you with a melee attack and attempts to use the grab ability, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you unless it has the Improved Grapple feat. If you hit the opponent with your attack, treat the damage you deal as 5 higher when calculating the penalty on the attacker's combat maneuver check to grapple you. [Normal] Creatures using the grab ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Shared Quarry					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ranger ~ Hunter's Bond,Ranger ~ Quarry																																																																				DESC:When working together, you and your companions are skilled at taking down particular targets.					SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:Allies sharing your favored enemy bonuses from hunter's bond gain an additional benefit against a creature you've denoted as your quarry. Affected allies gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls against your quarry; this bonus increases to +4 on attack rolls to confirm critical hits against your quarry. If your hunter's bond is with an animal companion, your companion gains the full benefits of your quarry class feature when you denote a quarry.
