Oozemaster					KEY:Alchemist Archetype ~ Oozemaster				CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.AlchemistArchetype																		SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:The oozemaster is a specialized alchemist who fights and ensnares oozes. An oozemaster carefully studies the characteristics of the oozes he hunts to help him create new and more effective mutagens and bombs.

Ooze Bomb					KEY:Oozemaster ~ Ooze Bomb						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.OozemasterClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:An oozemaster's bombs deal acid damage instead of fire damage, and they deal damage only on a direct hit; they do not splash. A creature damaged by an ooze bomb takes additional acid damage equal to the oozemaster's Intelligence modifier at the start of the oozemaster's next turn. A creature can take this delayed damage only once per round; additional hits extend the duration of the ongoing damage by 1 round each. &nl; An oozemaster cannot select discoveries that change the type of damage dealt by his bombs, nor those that affect the bomb's splash radius. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces the bomb class feature.
Ooze Toxin					KEY:Oozemaster ~ Ooze Toxin						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.OozemasterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:An oozemaster can extract deadly toxins from the bodies of slain oozes and use them against his foes, making him a deadly opponent with unpredictable stratagems. As a full-round action while adjacent to an ooze that died within the past 10 minutes, an oozemaster can attempt a Craft (alchemy) check with a DC equal to 10 + the ooze's Challenge Rating to create a toxin. If successful, the oozemaster can extract a number of doses of toxin from an ooze equal to half its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). These toxins remain potent for 1 hour before becoming inert. &nl; The oozemaster can throw an ooze toxin as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, or he can apply the toxin to a weapon as if it were an injury poison. The toxin deals 1d6 points of acid damage plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage per 3 Hit Dice the ooze had. If the ooze had any additional effects conveyed by its slam attack other than grab (such as a gelatinous cube's paralysis ability), the oozemaster can also apply these qualities to this attack. The save DC for additional abilities produced by this attack is %1. This ability replaces Brew Potion, though an oozemaster can still select Brew Potion without meeting the feat's prerequisites.|10+AlchemistLVL/2+INT		QUALIFY:ABILITY=FEAT|Brew Potion
Ooze Resistance				KEY:Oozemaster ~ Ooze Resistance					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.OozemasterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:An oozemaster becomes especially resistant to the abilities of his chosen foes.

# Alchemist Discoveries
# ==============================

Flesh-Eating Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Flesh-Eating Bomb					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier										SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:The alchemist can create bombs that devour living matter. The alchemist's bomb deals damage one die step higher than normal (regular bombs deal d8s, concussive bombs deal 1d6, and so on), but they have no effect on inorganic matter. In addition, a creature with at least a +1 armor bonus to AC is less likely to be harmed; such creatures in the bomb's splash radius take no damage on a successful Reflex save, and the target of a direct hit can attempt a Reflex save against the bomb's save DC to take only half damage.
Ooze Blight*				KEY:Discovery ~ Ooze Blight						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier										SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:A target hit by the alchemist's bomb loses the split special quality for 1d4 rounds. In addition, against creatures with the ooze type, this bomb deals untyped damage that bypasses all resistances.
Splitting Mutagen				KEY:Discovery ~ Splitting Mutagen					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistMutagenMod	PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,12				SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:Once per day while under the effects of his mutagen, the alchemist can split into two identical copies of himself as an immediate action after being damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon. Each copy has an ooze-like complexion, most often manifesting as a slimy sheen to his skin. The alchemist splits his current hit points evenly between the copies. The copies use the same statistics, share the same resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate item disappears from the other copy as well. &nl; The two copies act independently and each one has a full set of actions. At the end of the alchemist's next turn, he selects one of the copies, which loses its ooze-like complexion as it becomes the alchemist; the other copy dissolves into a fine mist and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and he gains 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed simultaneously (such as from a fireball), both copies collapse into formless goo; the alchemist can only be restored to life via resurrection or similarly powerful magic.
