Psychodermist				KEY:Occultist Archetype ~ Psychodermist				CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.OccultistArchetype																		SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:Rather than tapping the psychic energy residing within esoteric items, psychodermists form supernatural bonds with trophies taken from creatures they have slain. Through these mementos, these occultists manifest not only their own magic, but also the unique powers of their fallen foes.

Trophies					KEY:Psychodermist ~ Trophies						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.PsychodermistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:A psychodermist learns how to siphon power from pieces of creatures he has slain. The psychodermist gains Harvest Parts as a bonus feat, and he can select one monster part per implement school he knows to become a permanently preserved trophy so long as it remains in his possession. Each trophy functions as the psychodermist's implement for its associated implement school. A trophy that fits multiple implement categories, such as a hand with clawed fingers, can function for only one implement school at a time. A trophy can be integrated into another item, such as an ornament or a magic item, but otherwise does not take up a magic item slot, even when worn. A psychodermist can replace trophies with new ones harvested from slain foes, although doing so causes the old trophies to rot at their normal rate. In order to craft a trophy, the psychodermist must have been present during the creature's death. This ability alters implements.		ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Harvest Parts
Monster Hunting Lore			KEY:Psychodermist ~ Monster Hunting Lore				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.PsychodermistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary									SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:A psychodermist gains a bonus equal to half his occultist level on skill checks made to craft trophies and Knowledge checks made to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.
Discern Death				KEY:Psychodermist ~ Discern Death					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.PsychodermistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a psychodermist can glean information from a creature's corpse. The psychodermist must study at least one drop of the creature's blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as blood biography (APG), using the psychodermist's occultist level as his caster level. The psychodermist can use this ability %1 times per day.|(Occultist+1)/3
Seek Prey					KEY:Psychodermist ~ Seek Prey						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.PsychodermistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:A psychodermist can supernaturally detect creatures around him as a standard action. This functions as the spell aura sight (ACG), except the duration is 1 round and the psychodermist learns the locations and power of all auras of a specific creature type, similar to detect undead except the psychodermist can choose any creature type represented among the trophies he has selected for that day.
Residual Hatred				KEY:Psychodermist ~ Residual Hatred					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.PsychodermistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:A psychodermist can tap into the psychic death throes of the monsters his trophies are derived from, increasing his efficiency at slaying similar beasts. The psychodermist can spend mental focus invested in a trophy to gain the ranger's favored enemy class feature against the kind of creature from which the trophy was crafted. The favored enemy bonus applies against the specific creature variety, not the creature type; a psychodermist could use a red dragon scale trophy to gain favored enemy (red dragon), but not favored enemy (dragon). Each point of mental focus spent grants a cumulative +2 favored enemy bonus, to a maximum bonus of +%1. This benefit lasts until the psychodermist regains his mental focus.|2*(OccultistLVL/5)
Manifest Abilities			KEY:Psychodermist ~ Manifest Abilities				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.PsychodermistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:A psychodermist can use the latent energy within his trophies to replicate his victims' special abilities. As a standard action, he can spend 1 point of mental focus invested in a trophy to gain one of that creature's special abilities that could be granted by the spell	DESC:monstrous physique III (UM).|!PRECLASS:1,Occultist=16	DESC:monstrous physique IV (UM).|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=16	DESC:The saving throw DC for these special abilities is %1. Alternatively, he can spend 1 point of mental focus as a standard action to add any two of the creature's spell-like abilities to his list of spells known. To determine the spell's level for this ability, use the level as it appears on the spell list for an occultist, wizard, or cleric, in that order; if it appears on none of those lists, use the spell's highest spell level. For example, lesser restoration would be a 2nd-level spell, despite appearing on the paladin's 1st-level list. Both uses of this ability last for %2 minutes. He can instead spend 2 points of mental focus to activate this ability as a move action, or 3 points to activate it as a swift action.|10+OccultistLVL/2+INT|OccultistLVL
