Admonishing Ray		SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Force	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:one or more rays	DURATION:instantaneous	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes	DESC:You blast your enemies with rays of nonlethal force. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels you possess beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of nonlethal damage. This is a force effect. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be fired simultaneously and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other. The rays hit about as hard as a punch from a strong adult human, and can knock away unattended objects weighing up to 10 pounds if that amount of force could normally do so.
Enhanced Diplomacy	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:Divine	SCHOOL:Divination	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:creature touched	DURATION:1 minute or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	DESC:You imbue the subject with divine diplomacy skills. The creature gets a +2 competence bonus on a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.
Detect the Faithful	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Divine	SCHOOL:Divination	CLASSES:cleric,druid,paladin,ranger=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:60 ft.	TARGETAREA:cone-shaped emanation	DURATION:concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	DESC:You can detect other worshipers of your deity (mortal worshipers, outsider servants, and so on). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you focus on a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of the faithful. 2nd Round: Number of individual faithful in the area. 3rd Round: The exact location of each worshiper. If a fellow worshiper is outside your line of sight, then you discern his direction but not his exact location. Each round you can rotate to detect worshipers in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. The GM decides if worshipers are present. A creature's personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as you-hence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. The Green Faith counts as a deity for the purpose of this spell.
Sand Whirlwind		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Divine	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	CLASSES:cleric=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (a handful of sand, dust, or fine powder)	RANGE:medium	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (blinding only)	SPELLRES:no	DESC:A whirling cloud of sand strikes the target, blinding it and hampering its ability to speak. To speak while affected by the spell, the target must make a Concentration check (DC equal to the DC of this spell). If the target tries to cast a spell, the Concentration DC increases by the level of the spell being cast. A successful Will save negates the blindness but not the speechhampering effect.
Sand Whirlwind, Greater	KEY:Sand Whirlwind (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Divine	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	CLASSES:cleric=5	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius spread	DESC:This spell functions as sand whirlwind except as noted above.
Shield Speech		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	SCHOOL:Abjuration	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:bard,cleric,druid,sorcerer,wizard=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:you and one other creature	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	DESC:You can securely communicate with one creature within range. So long as your target remains within 10 feet of you, you and it can speak freely to each other without fear of being overheard. Communications that involve shield speech cannot be spied on, such as with a divination spell, and observers of the conversation can tell you are communicating but cannot read lips or hear the conversation unless they are the target of the spell. If you or the target speak to any other creatures, they can hear you normally (only communication between you and the target is protected). The spell does not shield writing, sign language, or any form of communication other than speaking.
Shield Speech, Greater	KEY:Shield Speech (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	SCHOOL:Abjuration	CLASSES:cleric,druid,sorcerer,wizard=4	RANGE:30 ft.	TARGETAREA:30-ft. emanation centered on you	DURATION:10 minute/level	DESC:This spell functions as shield speech, except all creatures within the dome may communicate with each other as if linked by shield speech. If they speak with anyone outside the area, those outside the area hear them normally.
Sign of the Dawnflower	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Divine	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:cleric,druid=0|paladin,ranger=1[PREDEITY:1,Sarenrae]	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:S, F	RANGE:medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:one creature/level	DURATION:1 hour/level	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no	DESC:As message, except the only information you can transmit is that you are a worshiper of Sarenrae. Once notified, the target can reply that he understands your sign. The spell transmits meaning, not sound, and transcends language barriers. Focus: your holy symbol, or a depiction of either Sarenrae's holy symbol or the goddess herself.
