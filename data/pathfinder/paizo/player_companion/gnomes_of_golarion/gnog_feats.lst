Arcane School Spirit	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.ArcaneSchoolPower	PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1						DESC:You can talk up the power of your own school of magic to such an extent that creatures find it more difficult to resist your spells.														SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you extol the virtues of your school of magic to one creature within 30 feet. Make a Bluff check opposed by a target's Sense Motive check; if you win the check, the target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws made to resist the next spell of this school that you cast. If your chosen school is universalist, choose a specific school each time you use this ability. If your Bluff check succeeds, however, your lack of true commitment to the school means the target takes only a -1 penalty on its saving throw.
Bewildering Koan		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ki Pool				PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1						DESC:You can pose unanswerable questions that leave creatures momentarily dumbfounded as they dwell on their significance.																SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:As a swift action, spend 1 point from your ki pool and make a Bluff check by asking a creature one of the impossible questions you ponder when meditating. If the creature fails its check, you choose whether it loses its next action or you gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you make against that creature for 1 round.
Blood Ties			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SorcererBloodline	PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1						DESC:Pointing out your shared kinship with someone gives you the chance to win over creatures associated with your bloodline.																			BENEFIT:When attempting a Diplomacy check to influence a creature with a plausible connection to your sorcerous bloodline, you may instead make a Bluff check. For example, a gnome sorcerer with the draconic bloodline may use this feat against dragons and their kin, but no other creatures.
Babble-Peddler		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:2,Appraise=5,Bluff=5					DESC:Your talent for flimflam allows you to trick creatures into exchanging valuable objects for whatever junk you happen to offer.															SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Caustic Slur		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FavoredEnemy		PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1						DESC:You know exactly how to insult your favored enemies in order to make them lose their heads.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a Bluff check against one sort of favored enemy. Any creature of that type within 60 feet of you must make a Will saving throw or become angered. If an affected creature attacks you, it's treated as if it were using Power Attack (taking a penalty on attack rolls but gaining a bonus on damage rolls). If the creature already has the power attack feat, the attack penalty increases by 1 and the damage bonus increases by 2. These modifiers end when combat ends. This ability does not work on creatures that cannot understand you, though sometimes a simple gesture is sufficient for an intelligent opponent to catch your gist regardless of any language barrier.
Helpless Prisoner		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:2,Bluff=5,Escape Artist=1				DESC:You can talk your way out of most restraints.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:When you are restrained or imprisoned, you can make a Bluff check against any one creature within 30 feet in which you emphasize both your own harmlessness and the pain or inconvenience of your current condition. If the creature knows you are dangerous, it adds a +4 bonus to its Sense Motive check. If you win the check, the target does something intended to make you a little more comfortable-or at least shut you up-that gives you a +5 bonus on your next Escape Artist check.
Invoke Primal Instinct	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Shape			PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1						DESC:You can use your ability to take the shape of an animal to enhance your Bluff skill, giving yourself an aura of danger or meekness that influences nearby creatures into doing what you want.				SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can pantomime or describe predator or prey-like behavior, expend one of your uses of wild shape, and make a Bluff check. All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save against your Bluff check DC regard you as a figure of either fear or contempt (your choice applies to all affected creatures). If you choose fear, the targets are frightened for 1 round per druid level. If you choose contempt, the targets consider you harmless for 1 minute, ignoring you unless you attack them or take a threatening action.
Tantrum			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage				PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1						DESC:Your crying, sputtering, and even frothing at the mouth makes you so laughably incoherent that opponents are apt to dismiss you as a threat.												SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:You may use the Bluff skill to feint while raging. The effect of the feint lasts only until the first time you hit the target.
Witty Feint			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.WeaponTraining		PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=1						DESC:Your blending of conversation and martial prowess makes it difficult for opponents to slip past your guard.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:When you successfully feint against an opponent in combat, instead of denying the opponent his Dexterity bonus, you may gain a dodge bonus to your AC against his attacks. This bonus is equal to your weapon training bonus for your current weapon. The bonus lasts until combat ends, you switch opponents, or you switch to a different weapon, whichever comes first.


Effortless Trickery	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome										DESC:Your natural knack for illusion allows you to maintain at least one illusion spell with little effort.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You can maintain concentration on one spell of the illusion school as a swift action. This has no effect on spells of other schools or on illusion spells with durations that don't depend on your active concentration. While you may only maintain one spell as a swift action, you may take your move and standard actions to maintain other spells normally, if you wish.

Extra Gnome Magic		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome							PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	DESC:The raw magic that flows through your gnome blood is stronger than normal.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You gain an additional three uses per day of your gnome spell-like abilities (dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation). You can use these in any combination; for example, you can use dancing lights four times in one day (taking all three additional uses for the same spell), or you can cast ghost sound twice, prestidigitation twice, speak with animals twice, and dancing lights once. If you have a feat, trait, or other ability that changes your racial 0-level spell-like abilities to other 0-level spells, this feat applies to them instead.

Threatening Illusion	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (Illusion)			PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome										DESC:You've mastered the art of making illusions that force foes to divide their attention in combat.																	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:You can use this metamagic feat only on Illusion (figment) spells.
