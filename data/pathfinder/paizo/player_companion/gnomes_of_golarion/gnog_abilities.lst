You finish people's sentences, blurt out the punch lines to slowly-told jokes, rarely make plans, and leap headlong into anything that looks like it might get interesting. While this has sometimes gotten you in trouble, it's also trained you to start moving a split second before everyone else, and that's saved your hide a few times as well.

Your parents taught you how to make the most of a solid mid-length sprint and how to squeeze just a little extra speed out of yourself.

Charlatan		KEY:Trait ~ Charlatan		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.MagicTrait	PREALIGN:NG,TN,NE,CG,CN,CE	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Charlatan],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.MagicTrait]		PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	DESC:Your talent for illusion goes beyond a mere knack for figments and phantasms. You can actually channel spell energy into simple illusions that augment your attempts at deception. As a swift action, you may expend one prepared spell or spell slot to gain a bonus on the next Bluff check you make, provided the check takes place before the beginning of your next turn. The bonus on this check is equal to the level of the spell consumed. You may use this ability 3 times per day.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Naturally Gifted	KEY:Trait ~ Naturally Gifted	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.MagicTrait						PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Naturally Gifted],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.MagicTrait]	PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	DESC:For unknown reasons, you have deeper reserves of magical energy than those around you. Perhaps you are descended from a family of powerful arcane casters, or maybe you believe this trait marks you as destined for magical greatness. Wherever the truth lies, you gain an additional use of one of your gnome magic spell-like abilities each day. This does not always have to be the same spell-like ability-one day you might use dancing lights twice, only to use the additional casting for speak with animals the next day.										SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Trickster		KEY:Trait ~ Gnome Trickster		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.MagicTrait						PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Gnome Trickster],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.MagicTrait]		PRERACE:1,Gnome,RACESUBTYPE=Gnome	DESC:You are particularly adept with your racial spell-like abilities, and as child you quickly learned how dancing lights and ghost sound could be used to amuse your friends and fool your elders. This natural talent for illusion continued as you grew older, and before long you were being offered training in more advanced figments and glamers. You gain a +1 trait bonus to your caster level when determining the duration, range, and area of all spells from the illusion school.

You do not gain the normal list of spell-like abilities for the gnome magic racial trait presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Instead, if you have a Wisdom of 11 of higher, you gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day-detect poison, know direction, stabilize, and speak with animals. The caster level for these effects is equal to your character level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + your Wisdom modifier.														SOURCEPAGE:p.14

DESC:You aren't just faithful to the worship of your patron deity-you are obsessively loyal to all of the faith's tenets and guidelines. Your devotion is an anchor that keeps you from drifting away into the throes of the Bleaching, and you cling to it like the life raft it is. As long as you remain completely faithful to the tenets of your faith (as determined by the GM), you never suffer from the Bleaching.

You find this strange menagerie useful in ways no non-gnome could understand. Seeking new items to add to this collection is endlessly fascinating to you, and while no one else may understand why a Chelish horsenail is worthy to add to your collection when a dwarven wheelbarrow nail is not, it all makes sense to you. Whenever you have your collection within 5 feet of you, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all %1 checks.|%LIST																																																		MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SKILL|Disable Device|Escape Artist|Spellcraft|TYPE=Craft|TYPE=Perform																	SOURCEPAGE:p.15

You are always looking around the next bend in the road or over the next hill, past the borders of where you are to where you want to be. At the beginning of each character level, select one desired terrain type from the following list: cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountains (including hills), plains, planes (other than the Material Plane), swamp, underground (including caves and dungeons), urban, or water. You gain a +2 bonus on all Survival checks made in your desired terrain type. At the beginning of each level, you must select a new desired terrain type to replace the old one (you cannot take the same desired terrain type two levels in a row).

Anytime you come across a new language, you are immediately absorbed by both how it works and what words you can co-opt from it for the Gnome language. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Linguistics checks, know one additional bonus language, and treat Linguistics as a class skill.
