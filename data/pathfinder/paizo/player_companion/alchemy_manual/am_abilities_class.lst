Drunken Rage								KEY:Drunken Rager ~ Drunken Rage			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.BarbarianFastMovement																																												DESC:A drunken rager can drink a unit of ale or other strong alcohol while raging to gain 1 drunken rage point. The act of drinking is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The barbarian can have a maximum of %1 drunken rage points. These drunken rage points last for 1 hour or until spent, whichever comes first. The barbarian can use drunken rage points only while raging. Unless otherwise noted, spending a drunken rage point is a free action. A drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point to increase her movement speed by 20 feet for 1 round, provided she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and is not carrying a heavy load. She can also spend 1 drunken rage point to gain 1 additional round of her rage class feature, which lasts for 1 hour or until used.|floor((BarbarianLVL-1)/2)+1																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.19

Drunken Swing								KEY:Drunken Rager ~ Drunken Swing			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility																																																DESC:At 12th level, a drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point as a swift action before making a melee attack to drastically increase the deadliness of her attack. The critical threat range of her next attack that round increases by 1 (for example, a critical threat range of 20 would increase to 19-20 ). This ability does not stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon. At 16th level and again at 20th level, the barbarian can spend 1 additional drunken rage point to further increase the critical threat range of her next attack (to a maximum critical threat range increase of 3 at 20th level). This ability replaces the rage power gained at 12th level.
