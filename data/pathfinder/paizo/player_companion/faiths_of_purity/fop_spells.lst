###Block: Full Spell Descriptions
# Spell Name			Description
Deadeye's Lore.MOD		DESC:While subject to this spell, you take upon yourself the mantle of the outdoorsman, channeling a small sliver of Erastil's divine knowledge of the wild. You gain a +4 sacred bonus on all Survival checks for the duration of the spell, and you do not have to move at half your speed while traveling through the wilderness or while tracking.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enhance Water.MOD			DESC:This spell transforms water into an alcoholic beverage, typically ale, beer, mead, or wine. The alcohol is of middling quality but drinkable. The spell also serves to remove poisons, disease, minerals, and other toxins from the water as it transforms. The more contaminants exist in the water, the darker the ale and the more full-bodied the wine. The alcohol content does not change. This spell does not work on unholy water, potions, or other liquids with magical power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hairline Fractures.MOD		DESC:With a single touch, you create momentary hairline fractures in a piece of stone or a creature with the earth subtype. If you cast this spell on a section of stone, you reduce its hardness to 5 and its hit points to 10/inch of thickness. If you cast this spell on a creature with the earth subtype, that creature takes a -2 penalty to AC for  the spell's duration. A Make Whole spell reverses this spell's effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Haze of Dreams.MOD		DESC:You fill an enemy's head with waking dreams, a reminder of the pleasures, delights, and terrors to be found in the dream world. While in this strange dream state, the target moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed. Multiple haze of dreams effects do not stack, nor does this spell's effect stack with Slow.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sun Metal.MOD			DESC:The target weapon ignites into flame that does not hurt the weapon or the wielder, but damages those hit by the weapon. When the weapon's wielder hits with this weapon, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage. This damage is not multiplied in the case of a critical hit. This effect immediately ends if the weapon is submerged in water. This effect does not stack with the flaming or flaming burst weapon special ability or any other effect that grants the weapon extra fire damage. It does not function on weapons with the frost or icy burst weapon special ability or any other effect that grants a weapon extra cold damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tap Inner Beauty.MOD		DESC:This spell allows you to tap into the natural beauty of your soul and let it shine from your eyes and your speech. While the spell is active, you gain a +2 insight bonus on all Charisma ability checks and Charisma-based skill checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trail of the Rose.MOD		DESC:This spell creates an illusory trail in the form of a misty and visible scent coming from the rose used as this spell's material component. When you cast this spell, the scent of the rose leaves a faint pink-tinged illusion that ripples and flows in the area. Only you and up to six creatures you designate upon casting the spell can see the illusion. To designate a creature, you must know it well. It is not enough simply to have met that creature once or heard of the creature. When you move, this illusory scent leaves a trail, though there are no telltale signs of which direction you moved if creatures designated by this spell find a middle section of the trail. This is typically used to create backtracking method for the caster's handpicked allies, useful for navigating in and out of mazes or labyrinthine cave complexes without leaving behind an obvious trail.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weapons Against Evil.MOD	DESC:The weapons this spell affects each shine with pale light that dimly illuminates a 5-foot square. These weapons also ignore the DR of evil creatures that have DR 5 or lower as long as it is not DR/epic.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
