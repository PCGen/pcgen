When a bow nomad makes a full attack with two bows, twoweapon penalties apply and can be offset with TwoWeapon Fighting feats. Since bows aren't light weapons, a bow nomad with Two-Weapon Fighting takes a -4 penalty on attacks with each ofher bows. Extra attacks from other sources, such as those granted by Manyshot or Rapid Shot, can be applied to only one of the wielded bows per round. This ability replaces wild empathy.		SOURCEPAGE:p.8

In addition to the normal benefit of Manyshot, the bow nomad can specify the bow in her off hands as the source of the second arrow (precision damage and critical damage are still only added once). The bow nomad takes no two-weapon penalties when using this ability, but she cannot use it and Two-Weapon Fighting in the same round. The nomad can still choose to use Manyshot in the normal manner. At 11th and 16th level, the bow nomad can apply this ability to each of her iterative attacks. This ability alters the 6th-level combat style feat and replaces camouflage and hide in plain sight.

If the bow nomad's attack roll exceeds her opponent's CMD, the opponent is pinned and cannot move from its current position. As a move action, the opponent can attempt a Strength check to free itself (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bow nomad's ranger level + her Strength modifier). Only creatures adjacent to a solid, anchored, penetrable surface can be affected by this ability.

If he does so during a surprise round, any allies not normally able to act in the surprise round can act.

Whether or not it is a surprise round, when the outrider uses this ability, allies within range are no longer flat-footed (assuming they were to begin with). This ability replaces greater banner.

Spirit of Summer: The season keeper's animal companion projects a is-foot-radius aura of cooling and vigor. Allies in the aura can exist comfortably in hot conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Summer born Triaxian. At 3rd level, the aura increases the power of the season keeper's healing magic-whenever the season keeper targets an ally with a spell that has the healing descriptor, the target also gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. At 9th level, allies within the aura leave no trails in natural grassy or forest environments, thus can't be tracked in such terrain. At isth level, the duration of the fast healing effect increases to 2 rounds per spell level and affected allies can ignore difficult terrain caused by natural undergrowth such as nonmagical thorns, briars, overgrowth, and similar terrain. Spirit of Winter: The season keeper's animal companion projects a is-foot-radius aura of warmth and calm. This aura allows allies to exist comfortably in cold conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Winterborn Triaxian. At 3rd level, allies gain resistance io to cold as long as they remain within the aura. At 9th level, affected allies leave no trails in natural snow or ice, thus can't be tracked in such terrain. At isth level, affected allies gain resistance 20 to cold and can ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow. This ability modifies nature bond and replaces trackless step, venom immunity, and timeless body.

A season keeper cannot use wild shape to assume the form of an elemental except an ice elemental, and can assume that shape only if her animal companion has the spirit of winter. Similarly, she can assume a plant form only if her animal companion has the spirit of summer. This ability modifies wild shape.
