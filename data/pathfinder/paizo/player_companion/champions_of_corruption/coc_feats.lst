Ally Shield			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork																																																				DESC:You are willing to use your allies as shields to ward off attacks aimed at you.											SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:Whenever you are the target of an attack and are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can pull the abettor into harm's way or dodge behind the abettor as an immediate action.
Callous Casting		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork																													PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=1					PRETEXT:Spellcraft 1 rank.											DESC:You don't care if your allies are harmed by your spells. The smart ones know this and start running.								SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:You initiate this feat by including an abetting ally in the area of any spell that deals damage of a type to which the abettor is not immune. The callousness of the attack disheartens foes in the area.
Chairbreaker		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Catch Off-Guard																													PRETEXT:Catch Off-Guard, base attack bonus +1.					PRETOTALAB:1	DESC:You deal more damage by breaking nearby objects against your enemies.													SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:When you attack a target with an improvised weapon, you can give that weapon the broken condition to deal 1d4 points of additional damage on that attack. You gain a +4 bonus on the roll to confirm a critical hit with this attack. If you confirm the crit, the extra damage granted by this feat is also multiplied and the improvised weapon is destroyed.
Craft Shadow Piercing	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:ItemCreation																						PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5				PRESKILL:1,Craft (Jewelry)=1				PRETEXT:Craft (jewelry) 5 ranks, caster level 5th.							DESC:You can craft magical piercings infused with the power of shadow.														SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You can create special wondrous items that adorn piercings in the wearer's flesh and grant magical abilities. Both you and the recipient of the piercing (if not yourself) must be present for the entire piercing process.
Destructive Persuasion	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																						PRESKILL:1,Intimidate=1		PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PRETEXT:Str 13, Power Attack, Intimidate 1 rank.							DESC:Sometimes, you have to break things if you want people to get your point.												SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can attempt to smash an unattended inanimate object while attempting an Intimidate check (see Smashing an Object, CRB 173). If you break the object, you gain a bonus to the Intimidate check equal to half its hardness (minimum +1). If you destroy the object, the bonus is equal to its hardness (minimum +1).
Fiendskin			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Damnation																																						PRETEXT:The patronage of a powerful evil outsider.							DESC:The forces of darkness gird you against the light.																SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:You gain defensive abilities related to your patron's outsider subtype. For example, if your patron is a devil, the abilities tie into the devil subtype (see Creature Subtypes, Bestiary p.310). The number of damnation feats you possess determines the exact benefit this feat provides.
Friendly Fire		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Precise Shot																														PRETEXT:Precise Shot.												DESC:Your ranged attacks startle your enemies, partly because you're not even trying to avoid hitting your allies.						SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you make a ranged attack against a foe engaged in melee with at least one abettor. You gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll if the attack passes through an abettor's space. If your shot misses the target, you must immediately make a second attack roll against the abettor. When the attack resolves (regardless of the result), the intended target's startled reaction provokes an attack of opportunity from the abettor.
Maleficium			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Damnation																																						PRETEXT:The patronage of a powerful evil outsider.							DESC:You are a master of dark magic.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:You cast spells with the evil descriptor with increased potency. The number of damnation feats you possess determines the exact benefit this feat provides.
Mask of Virtue		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Damnation																																						PRETEXT:The patronage of a powerful evil outsider.							DESC:Your alignment is known to you and you alone.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:Those who try to learn your true alignment find it hidden or receive a false result. Depending on the number of damnation feats you possess, spells or special abilities that would normally reveal your alignment return a vague or incorrect result.
Reckless Moves		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork																													PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=3					PRETEXT:Acrobatics 3 ranks.											DESC:You and your teammates push and pull each other to maintain your balance in precarious circumstances.								SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:If you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can initiate this feat as a free action to use the ally as a counterweight to improve your balance. You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks while the abettor takes a -2 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks as long as this feat remains in effect.
Shrapnel Strike		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Sunder,Power Attack																								PRESTAT:1,STR=15	PRETEXT:Str 15, Improved Sunder, Power Attack.								DESC:You can bash things to damage nearby opponents.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:When you break an object that can shatter (nothing made of soft, pliable material), you can send shards of its material flying out in all directions, dealing an amount of piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage equal to all creatures within 10 feet of the object, including yourself. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.
Soulless Gaze		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Damnation																																						PRETEXT:The patronage of a powerful evil outsider.							DESC:Otherworldly dread infuses your gaze.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:You can use the Intimidate skill to manipulate and terrify others.  The number of damnation feats you possess determines the exact benefit this feat provides.
Splash Volley		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork																																					PRETEXT:Base attack bonus +1.								PRETOTALAB:1	DESC:Your allies are used to being in the splash zone of your hurled weapons, and try to ensure that at least your opponent gets hit.			SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You initiate this feat whenever you throw a splash weapon into a square within the reach of an ally who also has this feat but miss your target. Rather than you rolling to see where the weapon lands, the abettor can try to redirect it as an immediate action by making a melee touch attack against any adjacent foe. If the abettor's attack hits that foe, the splash weapon impacts in the nearest square the targeted foe occupies.
Stunning Irruption	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																											PRESTAT:1,STR=15	PRETEXT:Str 15, Power Attack, base attack bonus +5.				PRETOTALAB:5	DESC:When you smash your way into a room, you gain more than just the element of surprise.										SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Before starting combat, you can attempt to break through a door, window, or wall to enter a room. If you succeed, the violence of your arrival is so great that all characters within 20 feet of your entry point must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned instead of acting in the surprise round (if there is one) plus 1 round thereafter. Characters who succeed at this save are instead shaken for 1d4 rounds.
Vile Leadership		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Leadership									PRELEVEL:MIN=7									PRETEXT:Character level 7th, good standing with an evil organization.				DESC:You rule over your own cabal of minions with a villainous cohort as your lieutenant.											SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:You can attract a loyal cohort and a number of cowed followers to assist you in your journeys. This feat is similar to Leadership, except Vile Leadership rewards-rather than hinders-leaders who have cruel reputations or who cause the deaths of their followers. Once you take this feat, you cannot take the Leadership feat without retraining your feat selection.
Wild Flanking		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																														PRETEXT:Power Attack, base attack bonus +4.					PRETOTALAB:4	DESC:When flanking, you use your position to rain grievous blows upon a trapped foe, with little regard to the well-being of your flanking partner.	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:When you are flanking an opponent with an ally who also possesses this feat, you can attack in such a way that your opponent takes extra damage, at the risk of these attacks striking your ally as well.
Summon Evil Monster	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																			PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE																	PRETEXT:Evil alignment.												DESC:You can summon the aid of creatures driven their very nature to destroy goodness.											SOURCEPAGE:p.33	BENEFIT:When casting a summon monster spell, you gain access to a list of powerful, evil creatures you can summon.

Damnation Feat	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DEFINE:DamnationFeatCount|0	
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Damnation Feat.MOD	DESC:Upon taking a damnation feat, the character's soul becomes ensnared by dark, otherworldly forces. From that point on, if the character dies, returning him to life proves to be more difficult. Any nonevil spellcaster who attempts to bring the character back from the dead must attempt a caster level check (DC = 10 + the slain character's Hit Dice). Success means the spell functions as normal, while failure means the spell fails and cannot be attempted again for 24 hours. Evil spellcasters, however, can raise the slain character normally, without a check.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Damnation Feat.MOD	DESC:Upon taking a second damnation feat, the character becomes even more ensnared by his doom. He remains difficult to return from the dead (as noted above), and he can't be affected by breath of life or raise dead, even when these spells are cast by an evil spellcaster. Also, the character's alignment shifts one step toward evil (typically toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron).|PREVARGTEQ:DamnationFeatCount,2
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Damnation Feat.MOD	DESC:This corruption continues if the character takes a third damnation feat. He is affected as previously noted, and in addition, the spell resurrection no longer affects him. The character's alignment again shifts one step toward evil (typically toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron).|PREVARGTEQ:DamnationFeatCount,3
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Damnation Feat.MOD	DESC:Finally, upon taking a fourth damnation feat, the character can no longer be returned from the dead by any method short of a wish or miracle. The character's alignment shifts one more step toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron.|PREVARGTEQ:DamnationFeatCount,4
