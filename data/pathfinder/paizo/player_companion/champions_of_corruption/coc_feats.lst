Callous Casting		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork																													PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=1					PRETEXT:Spellcraft 1 rank.											DESC:You don't care if your allies are harmed by your spells. The smart ones know this and start running.								SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:You initiate this feat by including an abetting ally in the area of any spell that deals damage of a type to which the abettor is not immune. The callousness of the attack disheartens foes in the area.

Fiendskin			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Damnation																																						PRETEXT:The patronage of a powerful evil outsider.							DESC:The forces of darkness gird you against the light.																SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:You gain defensive abilities related to your patron's outsider subtype. For example, if your patron is a devil, the abilities tie into the devil subtype (see Creature Subtypes, Bestiary p.310).

Friendly Fire		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Precise Shot																														PRETEXT:Precise Shot.												DESC:Your ranged attacks startle your enemies, partly because you're not even trying to avoid hitting your allies.						SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you make a ranged attack against a foe engaged in melee with at least one abettor. You gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll if the attack passes through an abettor's space. If your shot misses the target, you must immediately make a second attack roll against the abettor.

DESC:Your alignment is known to you and you alone.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:Those who try to learn your true alignment find it hidden or receive a false result. Depending on the number of damnation feats you possess, spells or special abilities that would normally reveal your alignment return a vague or incorrect result.
Reckless Moves		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork																													PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=3					PRETEXT:Acrobatics 3 ranks.											DESC:You and your teammates push and pull each other to maintain your balance in precarious circumstances.								SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:If you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can initiate this feat as a free action to use the ally as a counterweight to improve your balance. You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks while the abettor takes a -2 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks as long as this feat remains in effect.

Soulless Gaze		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Damnation																																						PRETEXT:The patronage of a powerful evil outsider.							DESC:Otherworldly dread infuses your gaze.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:You can use the Intimidate skill to manipulate and terrify others.  The number of damnation feats you possess determines the exact benefit this feat provides.
Splash Volley		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork																																					PRETEXT:Base attack bonus +1.								PRETOTALAB:1	DESC:Your allies are used to being in the splash zone of your hurled weapons, and try to ensure that at least your opponent gets hit.			SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You initiate this feat whenever you throw a splash weapon into a square within the reach of an ally who also has this feat but miss your target. Rather than you rolling to see where the weapon lands, the abettor can try to redirect it as an immediate action by making a melee touch attack against any adjacent foe. If the abettor's attack hits that foe, the splash weapon impacts in the nearest square the targeted foe occupies.
Stunning Irruption	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																											PRESTAT:1,STR=15	PRETEXT:Str 15, Power Attack, base attack bonus +5.

SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Before starting combat, you can attempt to break through a door, window, or wall to enter a room. If you succeed, the violence of your arrival is so great that all characters within 20 feet of your entry point must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned instead of acting in the surprise round (if there is one) plus 1 round thereafter. Characters who succeed at this save are instead shaken for 1d4 rounds.
Vile Leadership		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Leadership									PRELEVEL:MIN=7									PRETEXT:Character level 7th, good standing with an evil organization.

This feat is similar to Leadership, except Vile Leadership rewards-rather than hinders-leaders who have cruel reputations or who cause the deaths of their followers. Once you take this feat, you cannot take the Leadership feat without retraining your feat selection.
Wild Flanking		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Betrayal.Teamwork	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																														PRETEXT:Power Attack, base attack bonus +4.					PRETOTALAB:4	DESC:When flanking, you use your position to rain grievous blows upon a trapped foe, with little regard to the well-being of your flanking partner.	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:When you are flanking an opponent with an ally who also possesses this feat, you can attack in such a way that your opponent takes extra damage, at the risk of these attacks striking your ally as well.
Summon Evil Monster	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																			PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE																	PRETEXT:Evil alignment.												DESC:You can summon the aid of creatures driven their very nature to destroy goodness.											SOURCEPAGE:p.33	BENEFIT:When casting a summon monster spell, you gain access to a list of powerful, evil creatures you can summon.
