Half of this damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to fire-based attacks. On a successful save, the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal but does not take any of the heavenly fire damage. A crimson templar can use heavenly fire %2 times per day.|10+CrimsonTemplarLVL+CHA|CrimsonTemplarLVL
