Bladed Brush					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Focus (glaive)															PREDEITY:1,Shelyn					DESC:You know how to balance a polearm perfectly, striking with artful, yet deadly precision.												SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a glaive sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon. When wielding a glaive, you can treat it as a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon and as if you were not making attacks with your off-hand for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist’s or swashbuckler’s precise strike). As a move action, you can shorten your grip on the glaive, treating it as though it lacked the reach weapon property. You can adjust your grip to grant the weapon the reach property as a move action.																																																																																																																																			BONUS:WEAPONPROF=Glaive|TOHIT|((max(STR,DEX)-STR)+SHIELDACCHECK)
Daring Exploit					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Darechaser ~ Dare,Gunslinger ~ Deeds,Investigator ~ Inspiration,Swashbuckler ~ Deeds,TYPE.Deeds								DESC:Your determination allows you to accomplish great things, at a risk of great failure.												SOURCEPAGE:p.11	BENEFIT:%1 times per day before using the derring-do deed, a dare, or a similar ability that allows you to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, you can roll the bonus die twice and take the higher result. If rolling a high result would allow you to roll the bonus dice additional times, you gain the benefits of this feat only on the first roll.|1+(TL/4)
Erastil's Blessing	NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Focus (longbow)															PREDEITY:1,Erastil	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:Old Deadeye's favor grants you prowess with a bow that far exceeds your own physical capabilities.										SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:You can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier on ranged attack rolls when using a bow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																													BONUS:WEAPONPROF=TYPE.Bow|TOHIT|(max(DEX,WIS)-DEX)
Favored Prestige Class				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																															DESC:Levels gained in your favored prestige class grant additional benefits in a way similar to those you gain for taking levels in your base favored class.	SOURCEPAGE:p.3	BENEFIT:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Choose one prestige class and one skill that is a class skill for that prestige class. Whenever you gain a level in that prestige class, you receive +1 hit point or +1 skill rank. You gain a +2 bonus on checks using the skill you chose from that prestige class’s class skills. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Skill Focus, but does not stack with a bonus granted by any other feat (such as Magical Aptitude or Persuasive). The choice of favored prestige class cannot be changed once you make it. Levels in a favored prestige class are not the same as levels in a regular favored class, and as such levels in a favored prestige class can never be used to qualify or gain favored class options like those introduced in Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide. You can have only one favored prestige class, but can still have a favored base class as well. You can select this feat before you gain levels in your chosen favored prestige class, but the benefits of the feat do not apply until you actually gain at least 1 level in that prestige class. [Normal] Prestige classes cannot be a favored class, and cannot benefit from the additional hit point or skill rank afforded to those who take levels in a favored class.
Flame Blade Dervish				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat																									PRESPELL:1,Flame Blade				DESC:You move effortlessly when wielding a flame blade.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	BENEFIT:When you cast flame blade, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your base speed as long as the spell persists, along with a +4 competence bonus on all Acrobatics checks. You add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls with your flame blade, and ignore the first 10 points of fire resistance possessed by a creature you hit with the flame blade for the purposes of determining the damage dealt by the flame blade. Against undead foes, you ignore the first 30 points of fire resistance. Immunity to fire still completely protects against damage from your flame blade.
Ghost Whisperer					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																								PRESPELLTYPE:1,ANY=3				DESC:Your words soothe the dead and undead alike, and can even affect haunts.															SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:You gain Necril as a bonus language, and gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against undead creatures or when you speak Necril. Add speak with dead to your list of spells known. As soon as you gain the ability to cast 4th-level spells, add speak with haunt ACG to your list of spells known. Whenever you cast speak with dead or speak with haunt, treat your alignment as identical to that of the dead creature or haunt with which you are speaking, and increase the effective caster level of the spell by 2.

Guided Star						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Starry Grace																	PREDEITY:1,Desna		DESCISPI:YES	DESC:The grace of Desna guides your starknife to its target and back to your hand.														SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:You can empower a starknife with magical power once per day per character level as a swift action. Until the end of your turn, add your Wisdom modifier to your damage rolls with the starknife in addition to any other modifiers you normally add. If you throw the starknife during that time, it returns to you at the beginning of your next turn (as per the returning weapon special ability).
Prestigious Spellcaster				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Favored Prestige Class																						DESC:You gain 1 additional effective spellcaster level from your prestige class levels.													SOURCEPAGE:p.3	BENEFIT:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] The first time you gain a level in your favored prestige class and the spells per day class feature does not grant an increase in effective level for the purpose of casting spells, you gain new spells per day as if the prestige class did grant +1 level of spellcasting for that level. This effect is retroactive if you gain this feat at a level beyond the point where your favored prestige class would normally have not advanced your spellcasting. The Prestigious Spellcaster feat does not have any effect if your favored prestige class does not have the spells per day class feature, or if it does have the spells per day class feature but already grants a level increase for every level of the prestige class (as do the arcane trickster and loremaster prestige classes). [Special] You can select the Prestigious Spellcaster feat multiple times. Each time you select the Prestigious Spellcaster feat, your effective caster level increases by 1. However, regardless of the number of times you choose this feat, the total increase to your effective caster level cannot exceed your actual prestige class level. This feat also applies to prestige classes that grant extracts per day instead of spells per day.
Smite Evil Magic					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Smite Evil																						DESC:You can slice apart foul enchantments.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:You can expend a use of your smite evil class ability to perform a sunder combat maneuver against an ongoing spell effect created by an evil creature. For any effect other than one on a creature, the CMD equals 15 + the effect’s caster level. When sundering an effect on a creature, use the creature’s CMD + 5, ignoring any miss chance caused by a spell or spell-like ability. If successful, you suppress the effect for 1d4+1 rounds. If you exceed the CMD by 10 or more, the effect is dispelled. If an evil outsider, evil dragon, or undead creature created the spell effect, add your Charisma bonus to your combat maneuver check.
Strike True						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise																PRETOTALAB:6					DESC:Rather than attempting a series of wild blows, you line up a perfect attack.														SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:You can focus yourself as a move action. When focused, you gain a +4 bonus on your next melee attack roll before the end of your turn.
Two-Weapon Drunkard				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Catch Off-Guard,Two-Weapon Fighting																				DESC:You effortlessly wield tankards in your off hand, and can use them to drink from and as deadly weapons in a battle with equal ease.					SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:When you wield a tankard as an improvised weapon in your off hand, it functions as a light mace, including for the purpose of determining the effects of feats like Weapon Focus. If you worship Cayden Cailean, your off-hand tankard functions as a divine focus and does not interfere with somatic spell components. When you fight with two weapons and have the sickened condition, you do not apply the penalties from being sickened to attack rolls or weapon damage rolls. [Normal] A tankard wielded as an improvised weapon normally functions as a gauntlet.
Uncanny Ally					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Alertness					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Uncanny Dodge											DESC:You have learned to use your senses to protect others.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When you are conscious and able to move freely, allies adjacent to you who can see and hear you gain the benefit of your uncanny dodge. If you have improved uncanny dodge, as a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can designate one adjacent ally to receive the benefit of that ability as well. The ally can be sneak attacked by foes with 4 more rogue levels than your character level or your ally’s character level, whichever is lower.
