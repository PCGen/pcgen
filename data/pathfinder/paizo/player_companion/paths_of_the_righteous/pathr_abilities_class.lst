Sacred sentinel levels stack with levels in the selected class when determining the effectiveness of her familiar, animal companion, or bond class feature. Whenever the sacred sentinel uses strategic protection, her familiar, animal companion, or bonded companion is automatically included in its protection if in range, without counting toward the maximum number of creatures the sacred sentinel can affect. A sacred sentinel without an appropriate class feature from another class instead increases the number of creatures she can protect with her bastion of protection by 1 upon gaining this class feature, and by another 1 at 6th level. If the sacred sentinel has cavalier, paladin, or warpriest class levels, she selects one of those classes and adds half her sacred sentinel level to those class levels to determine her effective class level for a specific class feature.
