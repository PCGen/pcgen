When she does so with an alchemist extract, the draught functions as if enhanced by the infusion discovery. Spells can be distilled only if they qualify to be created as a potion or oil from the spell but without the limitation of being a 3rd- or lower-level spell. Once a draught is created, it persists for up to 24 hours, even if it is no longer in the brewkeeper’s possession. After this point, the draught becomes inert and the brewkeeper regains the use of that extract or spell slot (although she must still prepare that slot normally, as if she had cast the spell or used the extract from that slot during the day). As long as the draught remains potent, it continues to occupy one of the brewkeeper’s daily extract or spell slots. A draught functions as a potion or oil, and can be used by any creature.

The target can attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the effect of the harmful homebrew (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brewkeeper’s caster level + the brewkeeper’s highest mental ability score modifier). On a successful save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round (as if suffering, temporarily, the effects of intoxication), but on a failed save, the target is afflicted with the harmful homebrew’s effect, as chosen by the brewkeeper from the options below. Conditions inflicted by hindering homebrews don’t stack. At 3rd level, the brewkeeper can select one of the following effects when she successfully affects a creature with a harmful homebrew.

Although many announce these dares aloud, the ability functions as long as she can coherently and mentally articulate her dare; she cannot use this ability while confused, dazed, stunned, or panicked. She can use it while using the rage class feature, but only if she loudly announces the dare (treat this as having audible components—it can be defeated by magical silence). Once she declares her dare, the darechaser can add 1d%1 to the result of any one attack roll, saving throw, or other check that directly helps her fulfill the dare. If the result of the d%1 roll is a natural %1, she can roll another 1d%1 and add it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural %1s, up to %1 times. A darechaser thrives on challenging herself to accomplish difficult goals, and she receives little satisfaction when fulfilling easy objectives. If her check succeeded only because of the additional die’s (or dice’s) result, she benefits from one of the following effects (chosen by her) immediately after fulfilling the dare. If she succeeds at the check despite the added die’s result, she gains no additional benefit. &nl; [Daring Endurance] The darechaser immediately gains temporary hit points equal to 1d8+%3.

If the sacred sentinel has levels in a class with an animal companion, familiar, or a class feature with “bond” in the name (such as arcane bond, divine bond, or sacred bond), she selects one such class upon gaining her 1st level of sacred sentinel. Sacred sentinel levels stack with levels in the selected class when determining the effectiveness of her familiar, animal companion, or bond class feature. Whenever the sacred sentinel uses strategic protection, her familiar, animal companion, or bonded companion is automatically included in its protection if in range, without counting toward the maximum number of creatures the sacred sentinel can affect. A sacred sentinel without an appropriate class feature from another class instead increases the number of creatures she can protect with her bastion of protection by 1 upon gaining this class feature, and by another 1 at 6th level. If the sacred sentinel has cavalier, paladin, or warpriest class levels, she selects one of those classes and adds half her sacred sentinel level to those class levels to determine her effective class level for a specific class feature. For cavaliers, this determines the effectiveness of her challenge class feature. For paladins, this determines the effectiveness of her smite evil class feature.
