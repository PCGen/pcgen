Blend with Surroundings											TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard,Witch=1				SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Glamer									COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:This spell changes the appearance of the affected creature so that it better blends in with its surroundings. As chosen by you, the affected creature takes on the appearance of a statue, furniture, a tree, a bush, a rock, or another object of similar size. As long as the target stays still, it gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks, and it can use Stealth even if it is being observed. The target's armor blends in perfectly with the illusory shape, and the target's armor check penalty on Stealth checks is negated for the duration of the spell. If the target moves at all while this spell is in effect, the spell ends.
Body Double													TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Bard,Bloodrager,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Glamer									COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Two creatures; see text												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:Upon casting this spell, choose a primary target and a secondary target, both of which must be within range. If the primary target fails or forfeits its saving throw, its appearance, scent, sounds, and mannerisms change to match those of the secondary target. As long as the two targets are of the same size category, they are indistinguishable. As a consequence, if the targets are adjacent and a creature takes an action that would affect one of the targets, that action has a 50%% chance of affecting the other target instead. Any action that would affect both of the creatures affects them both normally. This spell does not deceive creatures that have true seeing. Likewise, a creature that can't perceive one of the targets is not fooled by this spell (even if the spell fooled that creature earlier), and its attacks, targeted spells, and other actions affect targets as normal.
Drain Poison												TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Witch=3					SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Poison				COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One weapon or a single piece of ammunition									DURATION:24 hours							SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:By touching a weapon to the fang of a poisonous creature during casting drains 1 dose of the creature's poison and applies it to your weapon without risk of poisoning yourself. The poison remains on the weapon until it strikes a creature or you wipe off the poison. It otherwise functions exactly like a dose of a manufactured poison applied to a weapon. You can use this spell with natural as well as manufactured weapons. This spell does not prevent you from exposing yourself to the poison if you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll. The spell has no effect if the creature whose fang is touched is a summoned creature, if it has been dead for more than 1 minute, or if its poison has already been extracted from it.
Garden of Peril												TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=2 					SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Creation		DESCRIPTOR:Poison				COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) poisonous mushrooms, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:Poisonous mushrooms instantly spring into existence in squares you select, on any solid surface, even growing horizontally or upside down. Once per round as a move action, starting the round after you cast this spell, you can command the mushrooms to release poisonous spores. Each creature adjacent to a mushroom or in a mushroom's square must then succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. The condition of creatures that fail multiple saving throws does not worsen, but each additional failed saving throw adds 1d4 rounds to the duration the creature is sickened. The mushrooms are Tiny and cannot provide cover, but they are fairly sturdy (AC 7, hp 30, break DC 20). Creatures can move through squares containing mushrooms as normal. When destroyed, a mushroom evaporates and releases one last cloud of spores.
Grasping Tentacles											TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Bloodrager,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=3					SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Creation								COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius spread												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:This spell functions as black tentacles, except instead of grapple attempts, the tentacles attempt dirty trick combat maneuver checks (CMB = %1). Roll to determine the effect of a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check.  d%% Effect - 1–20 Blinded. 21–40 Deafened. 41–60 Entangled. 61–80 Shaken. 81–100 Sickened.|CASTERLEVEL+5
Grease (Greater)				OUTPUTNAME:Grease, Greater				TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Bard,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=5							SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Creation								COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(floor(CASTERLEVEL/2)) objects or 10-ft. squares; see text						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]				SAVEINFO:See text					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:This spell functions like grease, except as noted here. When you use this spell to cover a solid surface with slippery grease, the 10-foot squares must form a continuous area, each part of which must be within the spell's range. When you use this spell to create a greasy coating on items, no two of the targeted items can be more than 30 feet apart. You cannot target both items and surfaces with a single casting of this spell.
Hide Weapon													TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bloodrager,Inquisitor,Magus,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:Upon casting this spell, a light or one-handed melee weapon in your hand melds with your flesh. The weapon disappears completely inside your arm, and thereafter for the duration of the spell, you can extend and retract the weapon as a move action. While extended, the weapon remains partially melded with your hand and arm, providing a +5 bonus to your CMD against disarm combat maneuvers. While the weapon is retracted, its shape adjusts to fit inside your arm, and you retain the use of your hand. Spotting the weapon on casual inspection is impossible, but anyone frisking you can attempt a DC 25 Perception check to notice a light weapon or a DC 20 Perception check to notice a one-handed weapon hidden inside your arm. If the weapon grants a bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to hide it (as does a dagger), the bonus is added to the DC to find the item. Anyone who sees you casting this spell doesn't need to succeed at a Perception check to know you have the hidden weapon. If you cast this spell a second time, you can hide another weapon inside your other arm. You can extend and retract both weapons as part of the same action.
Invigorating Poison											TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Druid,Shaman=2								SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:When a poison would cause ability damage to the target creature, the target instead gains a +4 alchemical bonus to that ability score. The spell then immediately ends, but the bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of ability damage the poison would have caused. If the poison would deal more than one type of ability damage, each bonus has a separate duration. If the poison has effects other than ability damage (such as unconsciousness or ability drain), these effects apply normally. This spell affects only a single poison; if multiple poisons affect the target simultaneously, this spell prevents only ability damage and grants the appropriate bonuses for the poison that would cause the most damage.
Neutralize Poison (Greater)		OUTPUTNAME:Neutralize Poison, Greater		TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid=5|Alchemist,Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Witch=6					SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Healing									COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature or object of up to (CASTERLEVEL) cu. ft. touched						DURATION:Instantaneous or (CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:This spell functions as neutralize poison, except as noted here. You automatically succeed at all caster level checks to neutralize any poisons affecting the target creature. The spell also reverses all instantaneous or permanent effects caused by poisons, such as temporary ability damage or permanent ability drain (it does not heal ability drain caused by anything other than poison, however). If you use the spell to neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object, the duration is %1 hours rather than %2 minutes. If the spell is cast on a creature, the creature can negate the effect by succeeding at a Will saving throw.|CASTERLEVEL|CASTERLEVEL*10
Poison Breath												TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid=6|Cleric,Witch=7									SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Poison				COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:15 ft.	TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst													DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:You expel a cone-shaped burst of toxic mist from your mouth, subjecting everyone caught in the area to a deadly poison, as per the poison spell. (1d3 Con damage per round for 6 rounds, Fort saves ends affliction) 
Selective Invisibility											TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Bard,Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Glamer									COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:You and one other creature											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:Upon casting this spell, you turn invisible, as per the invisibility spell, and you choose a second target. That creature can still see you as though you were not invisible, and you can attack that creature without ending the invisibility effect on you. However, if you attack any other creature, this spell ends. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can attack any of the affected creatures without ending the spell.
Sense Vitals												TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=2						SCHOOL:Divination														COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This spell makes your eyes shine blood red and allows you to see the vital areas and weak points of creatures within 30 feet of you as a warm glow. This allows you to use any manufactured weapon to make sneak attacks, as the rogue ability of the same name, dealing an additional %1d6 points of damage. This additional damage stacks with other sources of precision damage.|min(5,floor(CASTERLEVEL/3))
Shifting Shadows												TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Darkness			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:None (see text)			SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:While this spell is in effect, every creature in the area can treat any other creature in the area as an allied threatening creature for the purpose of flanking. Further, whenever a creature in the area would provoke an attack of opportunity from an enemy, that creatures' allies in the area must succeed at a Reflex save or lose one attack of opportunity for that round as they suppress the instinct to attack a vulnerable target that might be an ally. The shadows do not hinder precision-based attacks or create areas of dim light. Creatures under the effect of true seeing are not affected by this spell. Creatures with scent or keen scent, creatures that are blind, and creatures that operate effectively without vision (such as creatures with blindsight or blindsense) are also not affected by this spell.
Sword to Snake												TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=4					SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Poison				COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One Medium or smaller item											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)		SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:The target item changes slightly to resemble a cross between its original form and that of a venomous animal. If cast on a held item, the wielder adds his Will save bonus to the saving throw. You must be able to see the item to cast this spell on it. The item retains all its properties, but whenever a creature picks up, attacks with, activates, or otherwise manipulates the item , it animates and bites the creature. The attack is resolved before the action that triggered it. This spell otherwise does not affect the creature's ability to use the item. If the item is a nonmagical weapon, it has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your spellcasting ability score modifier, and its attack deals 1d4 points of piercing damage. If the target item is a magic weapon, it retains any magical qualities, and its enhancement bonus is still added to both the attack roll and the damage roll. A creature that takes damage from the bite is affected as if by a venomous snake's poison (frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 1 save). The poison's save DC is equal to this spell's DC.
Toxic Rupture												TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Poison				COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One poisonous creature												DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:With a squeezing hand gesture, you cause internal bleeding in the target creature's venom glands or similar organs. The target must attempt a saving throw against its own poison using the DC for this spell. If it fails, the creature is poisoned and suffers the full effect of its poison. Any subsequent saving throws that the target must attempt against the poison use the normal DC for the poison rather than this spell's DC.
Venomous Bite												TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Druid,Ranger,Shaman,Summoner,Witch=2					SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Poison				COMPS:V,S,M,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.29		DESC:When you touch the poison vial against the target creature and cast this spell, the vial drains and the target's teeth become envenomed with the same poison. The creature gains the use of %1 doses of the poison. The creature gains immunity to that poison while this spell is in effect. The poison retains its normal properties, and this spell does not alter the DC to resist or cure the poison. Each successful bite attack counts as an expended dose. When all the poison is used, the spell ends. If the target creature doesn't have a bite attack, or if the target's bite attack is already poisonous, the spell has no effect. If the target has multiple heads, the spell affects only one bite attack. When this spell ends, any unused poison is harmlessly expelled from the target's mouth and cannot be used again.|min(4,max(1,floor(CASTERLEVEL/5)))
