##Boot Tricks
Cleat Stomp			KEY:Boot Trick ~ Cleat Stomp				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:When you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent while wearing a pair of boots with cleats (UE p.88), the target takes 1 point of bleed damage. The bleed damage can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or by magical healing. The effects of this trick stack with other sources of bleed damage but not with other bleed damage dealt by this trick.																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:18
Heel Crush			KEY:Boot Trick ~ Heel Crush				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:When you succeed at a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check against an opponent within melee range, you can crush the target's foot or similar appendage with your boot heel. Instead of inflicting one of the conditions that can normally be imposed by a dirty trick, you reduce the target's movement speed by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). You can't use a dirty trick combat maneuver in this manner against an opponent that is using a movement type other than its land speed, and movement types other than land speeds aren't affected by this equipment trick.																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:18
Sharp Veer			KEY:Boot Trick ~ Sharp Veer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:Whenever you use the charge or run action, you can make one 90-degree turn during your movement. You must move at least 10 feet in a straight line after this turn if you are charging.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:18

##Cloak Tricks
Dazzling Trail		KEY:Cloak Trick ~ Dazzling Trail			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:When you successfully use Intimidate to demoralize an opponent while wearing a cloak, you can increase the duration of the demoralize effect by 1d4 rounds.																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:18
Distracting Cloak		KEY:Cloak Trick ~ Distracting Cloak			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:When you attempt a Bluff check to feint, you can use your cape to create a diversion instead of denying your opponent his Dexterity bonus to AC. Compare the result of your Bluff check against the feint DC of each opponent that can see you. You can attempt a Stealth check to hide from any opponent that you successfully feint against in this manner, even if that opponent is observing you. If you do not have cover or concealment against any of these targets at the start of each of their turns, they automatically spot you at that time.																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:18
Parachute Cloak		KEY:Cloak Trick ~ Parachute Cloak			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:While wearing a cloak, you can adjust your grip so that it catches the air as you fall. If you use both of your hands to hold on to your cloak as you fall, you can attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics check to ignore the first 20 feet fallen (as opposed to the usual DC 15 check to ignore only the first 10 feet), and you avoid falling prone at the end of your jump even if you take damage.																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:18
Suerte de Capote		KEY:Cloak Trick ~ Suerte de Capote			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:While using the Dueling Cape feat to wield a cloak or similar object as a buckler, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to feint in combat. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 ranks in Sleight of Hand that you possess. Additionally, you can release your cape as a free action whenever you successfully feint an opponent with a melee attack to entangle it, as detailed in the Dueling Cape feat.																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:18

##Net Tricks
Binding Trick		KEY:Net Trick ~ Binding Trick				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:When you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against a target entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, the target cannot take an action to remove the condition imposed by the dirty trick until it escapes from or bursts free of the net.																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:18
Grappling Net		KEY:Net Trick ~ Grappling Net				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:When you attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against a foe entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, you do not take a penalty on the grapple combat maneuver check for not having two hands free, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. If you successfully pin the target while it is still entangled by the net, you can use the net to tie up the target as a swift action.																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:19

##Thieves' Tools Tricks
Dirty Pick			KEY:Thieves' Tools Trick ~ Dirty Pick		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:You don't take any penalties for using a set of thieves' tools as an improvised melee weapon. A set of thieves' tools used as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of piercing damage. Additionally, when you attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check to impose the blinded condition with a set of thieves' tools, you don't provoke an attack of opportunity. Masterwork thieves' tools grant a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks for these purposes.																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:19
Let Myself In		KEY:Thieves' Tools Trick ~ Let Myself In		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:Whenever you succeed at a Disable Device check to unlock an object that requires a move action to open, such as a door, you can immediately open that object as a free action instead.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:19
Ranged Chicanery		KEY:Thieves' Tools Trick ~ Ranged Chicanery	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:You can use mage hand to attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks at range. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by an amount equal to 5 + 1 for every 5 feet the range is greater than 25 feet. You can't take 10 or 20 on this check. Any object manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. If you also possess the ranged legerdemain class feature, you no longer increase the skill check DC by 5 while using Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at range.																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:19

##Wondrous Item Tricks
Aura Mastery		KEY:Wondrous Item Trick ~ Aura Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:Once per day, you can choose a single school of magic represented by one of your wondrous items' auras; you treat your caster level as 1 higher when casting a single spell of that school. You can make this choice at any time during the day, but you must choose the item (and school) before casting the spell.																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:19
Counter Dispelling	KEY:Wondrous Item Trick ~ Counter Dispelling	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:When a foe attempts a dispel check, such as via dispel magic, against either a wondrous item that you are currently wearing or wielding or a spell effect created by such an item, you can use your ranks in Use Magic Device as the item's caster level instead of its actual caster level when calculating the dispel check DC. You must be aware of the spell that is being cast and identify it with a successful Spellcraft check in order to receive this benefit.																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:19
Favored Item		KEY:Wondrous Item Trick ~ Favored Item		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																						DESC:Once per day, you can spend 1 hour practicing with a wondrous item to designate it as your favored item for that day. If the favored item functions for a specific number of rounds or minutes per day greater than 1 round or 1 minute, you increase the maximum number of rounds or minutes it can function that day by an amount equal to half your ranks in Use Magic Device (minimum 1 round).
