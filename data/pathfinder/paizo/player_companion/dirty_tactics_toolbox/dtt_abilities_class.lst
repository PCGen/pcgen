Known as toxicants, these deadly artists induce the production of deadly secretions within their own bodies in order to better inflict crippling conditions upon their foes.

Toxic Secretion		KEY:Toxicant ~ Toxic Secretion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AlchemistMutagen																																																																																														DESC:A toxicant has learned to mimic creatures with the ability to secrete harmful toxins through the skin. Once per day, in a process that takes 10 minutes, the toxicant can create and imbibe a tincture that causes her skin to secrete a mild toxin. The toxicant is immune to this secretion, but any creature that hits her with a natural attack or unarmed strike must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1). On a failed save, the target takes %2 points of damage.|10+floor(AlchemistLVL/2)+INT|INT	DESC:A target that fails its save must succeed at a second save 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum of %1 rounds. This is a poison effect (UM p.138). The toxicant can suppress this secretion as a standard action, in which case it remains suppressed for 1 hour or until the toxicant reactivates it as a standard action.|min(5,floor(AlchemistLVL/4))+1|PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,4	DESC:At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the toxicant can choose a condition to have her toxin impose. Once this choice is made, it can't be changed. A creature that fails its save against the toxic secretion also gains these conditions until it succeeds at a save against the secretion, or until the toxin's duration ends. As a swift action, the toxicant can collect and concentrate this secretion into a poison she can deliver as a touch attack or apply to a weapon. Targets of such attacks must attempt saving throws as if they had touched the toxicant's toxic secretion. The toxicant can do this %1 times per day.|AlchemistLVL+INT																																																																																																																							BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Toxicant Secretion Choice|AlchemistLVL/3																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Toxic Digestion		KEY:Toxicant ~ Toxic Digestion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AlchemistPersistentMutagen																																																																																												DESC:A toxicant can drink a poison as a standard action and suspend it within her own body. She is not affected by the poison, and doesn't need to attempt saving throws against it. When the toxicant next uses her toxic secretion on a creature that attacks her with a natural or unarmed attack, she can expose the attacker to the digested poison (with that poison's normal duration, effects, and save DC) rather than her normal toxic secretion, even if the digested poison isn't normally a contact poison. The alchemist can maintain only a single digested poison at a time. If she digests a new poison, any older digested poison is lost.
