If the target fails the save against the poison, the poison takes effect immediately, ignoring any onset time. The poison uses its save DC (rather than the save DC of the spell), but is modified by any effects that increase the spell's DC (such as Spell Focus). This feat works only with spells whose effects can be negated by a successful Fortitude save. A toxic spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.

If the target fails its Will save against a trick spell, in addition to the spell's normal effects, the target also clumsily hinders itself. Immediately attempt a special combat maneuver check (1d20 + your caster level + your Charisma bonus) to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target. Any feats you have that apply to dirty trick maneuvers also apply to this check. A trick spell takes up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.						ADDSPELLLEVEL:1

Wasp Familiar				CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:General					PREALIGN:CN			PREDEITY:1,Calistria																																										PRETEXT:Chaotic neutral alignment, worshiper of Calistria.									DESCISPI:Yes			DESC:The goddess of lust, revenge, and trickery has granted you a living sting to show her favor in you.		SOURCEPAGE:p.17			BENEFIT:You gain familiar as per the arcane bond class feature, using your character level as your wizard level. The familiar is a cat-sized, chaotic neutral wasp loyal to you. If you have the ability to gain a familiar through other means (such as the arcane bond class feature), and you are at least 5th level, instead gain a Calistrian wasp. You can have only one familiar. If you ever grossly violate the code of conduct required by Calistria (a violation of the scale that would cause a cleric of Calistria to lose all spells and class features), your familiar turns on you and attacks you until it is killed. To regain a familiar, you must atone for your deeds with the atonement spell, and pay to have the slain familiar raised from the dead. If your familiar is slain or lost through other means, you can replace it using the normal rules for replacing familiars. Special: This feat can be taken a second time by characters of 7th or higher level if they do not otherwise have access to familiars. Such characters have access to a Calistrian wasp.
