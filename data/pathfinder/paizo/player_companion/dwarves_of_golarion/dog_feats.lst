# Ability Name		Category of Ability	Type		Required Ability						Multiple Requirements										Required Stat	PRETOTALAB		Req. Weapond Prof.				Description														Source Page		Benefits
Bounding Hammer		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																									PRETOTALAB:6	PREWEAPONPROF:1,Hammer (Light)		DESC:You can throw a hammer so it rebounds near you.							SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you may throw a hammer at an opponent within 20 feet. If you hit (whether or not the attack damages the target), the hammer rebounds off of the creature and lands in your square. If you have the Snatch Arrows feat, you may choose to catch the hammer when it enters your square (though this does not give you the ability to immediately throw the hammer). This ability may not work against some creatures or in certain circumstances as determined by the GM; for example, your weapon does not bounce off incorporeal creatures (unless it has the ghost touch ability), it may stick to creatures with the adhesive ability, the slowing effect of fighting underwater prevents you from using this feat, and so on.
Darting Viper		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																									PRETOTALAB:4	PREWEAPONPROF:1,Dorn-Dergar (Dwarven)	DESC:When using a dorn-dergar, you can quickly attack both near and distant foes.		SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You may change whether you're using the dorndergar as a normal or reach weapon as a swift action.
Dorn-Dergar Master	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Two-Weapon Fighting																	PRETOTALAB:4	PREWEAPONPROF:1,Dorn-Dergar (Dwarven)	DESC:You can use a dorn-dergar with only one hand.							SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You can use a dorn-dergar as a one-handed weapon. When using it one-handed, changing whether it's a normal or reach weapon is a full-round action. If you have the Darting Viper feat, changing its reach is a move action.
Sliding Axe Throw		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat									PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13],[PREVARGTEQ:FeatDexRequirement,13]				PRETOTALAB:1								DESC:You may aim your thrown axe to avoid an enemy's shield and even trip your opponent.	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You can choose to take a -2 penalty on a ranged attack roll with an axe, bouncing it or sliding it along the ground. If the target is flat-footed, running, or charging, this attack ignores any bonuses to the target's AC from its shield. If the attack hits, you may immediately make a trip attempt against the target as a free action. If you fail to trip your opponent, your opponent does not get an attempt to trip you in return. This ability may not work in certain circumstances as determined by the GM, such as if the ground is soft, there is an obstacle or difficult terrain on the floor between you and your target, and so on.
Stance of the Xorn	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																						PRESTAT:1,WIS=15	PRETOTALAB:3								DESC:You have heightened awareness of enemies on all sides.						SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:Flanking creatures do not gain a +2 bonus to attack you (this does not prevent you from being sneak attacked or denied your Dexterity bonus). A condition that makes you lose your Dex bonus to AC also makes you lose the benefits of this feat.
