Enlightened Step			TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Shaman=6					SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Air|Meditative	COMPS:V,M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:12	DESC:Through careful regulation of your body's mystical energies, thoughtful control of your poise and balance, and the focus in your mind on the surety of each and every step you take, you are able to make your steps lighter than air.

Additionally, at any time during the spell's duration, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as a swift action in order to gain a fly speed of 120 feet with perfect maneuverability for 1 minute. After this time, the spell ends. [MATERIAL COMPONENT] soothing incense worth 600 gp.
Firewalker's Meditation		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Paladin=3|Cleric,Druid,Shaman,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Abjuration		DESCRIPTOR:Meditative		COMPS:V,M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:12	DESC:You focus your mind on blocking out pain, allowing your body to endure punishments that would be otherwise unbearable. While under the effects of this spell, you continue to register painâ€”you simply don't suffer the deleterious effects such sensations bring. For example, if you were lit on fire as you slept, you would still wake from the pain of burning even though some of the fire damage you endured (perhaps all of it) would be negated by this spell. You gain DR 5/magic, resist fire 10, and a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist pain effects. Once the spell has prevented a total of %1 points of damage, it is discharged. At any time during the spell's duration when you take damage that would be subject to the damage reduction or energy resistance granted by this spell, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an immediate action in order to increase the effects to DR 10/magic, resist fire 30, and immunity to pain effects. If you do so, these enhanced effects persist for 3 rounds. After this time, the spell ends. [MATERIAL COMPONENT] soothing incense worth 400 gp.|min(100,CASTERLEVEL*10)
Medusa's Bane			TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4				SCHOOL:Abjuration							COMPS:V,S,M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SOURCEPAGE:5	DESC:This spell causes your eyes to take on a silvery mirror-like quality, transforming your eyes into metallic-looking orbs that reflect the world you see. Your vision is in no way impaired while this spell is in effect, but you are granted immunity to gaze attacks for the spell's duration. As an immediate action, you can reflect a creature's gaze back on itself, forcing the target of the gaze attack to save against its own gaze weapon or be affected by it. This reflection bypasses the typical immunity creatures with gaze attacks have to their own race's gaze attack, but does not bypass any other resistances or immunities the creature might have. Once you choose to reflect a gaze attack in this manner, the effect of medusa's bane immediately ends.
Rite of Bodily Purity		TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Paladin,Ranger,Shaman=1		SCHOOL:Abjuration		DESCRIPTOR:Meditative		COMPS:V,M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:13	DESC:You energize your body's immune system, improving your ability to resist toxins and ailments. You gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws to resist diseases, drugs, and poisons. Additionally, at any time during the spell's duration, whenever you fail a saving throw to resist a disease, drug, or poison, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an immediate action in order to reroll that saving throw. You must take the second result, even if it's worse. The +2 resistance bonus granted by the spell applies to the reroll, but after you make this reroll, the spell ends. [MATERIAL COMPONENT] soothing incense worth 100 gp.
Rite of Centered Mind		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Shaman,Wizard=1			SCHOOL:Abjuration		DESCRIPTOR:Meditative		COMPS:V,M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:13	DESC:You heighten your awareness of your own thoughts, allowing you to more easily resist outside influences. You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws to resist mind-affecting effects. This resistance bonus is increased to +2 if the effect is an emotion or fear effect. Additionally, at any time during the spell's duration, whenever you fail a saving throw to resist a mind-affecting effect, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an immediate action in order to reroll that saving throw. You must take the second result, even if it's worse. The +2 resistance bonus granted by the spell applies to the reroll, but after you make this reroll, the spell ends. [MATERIAL COMPONENT] soothing incense worth 100 gp.
See Beyond				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Shaman,Witch,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Divination		DESCRIPTOR:Meditative		COMPS:V,M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:13	DESC:You attune your mind and your sight to the hidden world of spirits. You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Perception checks; this circumstance bonus increases to a +10 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to find invisible creatures or objects, incorporeal creatures or objects, or things that exist only on the Ethereal Plane. Additionally, at any time during the spell's duration, you can push your ethereal vision even further as a swift action. When you do, you can see through solid objects (as if using a ring of x-ray vision) for 5 rounds. After this time, the spell ends. [MATERIAL COMPONENT] soothing incense worth 300 gp.
Spirit Bonds			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Shaman,Witch,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Divination		DESCRIPTOR:Meditative		COMPS:V,M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours or until discharged	SOURCEPAGE:13	DESC:You heighten your awareness of up to (CASTERLEVEL/3) willing creatures or objects, each of which must be within 30 feet of you during the entire hour you spend preparing spells and casting spirit bonds. By concentrating on one of these creatures or objects as a full-round action, you can learn its direction and relative distance from your location, provided that it is on the same plane. In the case of a creature, you can also learn the state of its emotion or health aura as a full-round action (see page 198 of Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures for more information about auras). In the case of an object, you can also get a sense of how damaged it is, similar to reading the health aura of a creature, or, in the case of a magic item that must be activated, you can learn when it was last activated (a full-round action in either case). Additionally, at any time during the spell's duration, you can deliver a single message to any of the creatures that participated in the spell. This message is delivered telepathically regardless of range and can be up to 25 words in length. Delivering a message in this way severs your connection with that character, and you can no longer learn information about that creature through this spell, but doing so does not impact the remaining duration you have linked to other creatures or objects. [MATERIAL COMPONENT] soothing incense worth 300 gp.

Unlike with most polymorph effects, your basic form does not change, so you keep all extraordinary and supernatural abilities of your normal form as well as all of your gear. For the duration of the spell, you receive a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence and are treated as if you possessed any one feat for which you meet the prerequisites, chosen when you cast this spell. The first time each day that you cast this spell, you must select a feat and make all the associated choices that come with it. Once that choice is made, it is set for the day and additional castings must make the exact same decisions.

Flame Blade (electrical variant).MOD						DESC:A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of creackling electricity springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of electricity damage + 1 point per two caster levels [maximum +10]. Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
