The duration of the sickened effect doesn't stack with multiple critical threats.																																																												DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Int 13; Combat Expertise; Divine Fighting Technique; Improved Feint; base attack bonus +10 or Bluff 10 ranks.																																														DESC:[Advanced Benefit] An opponent that you hit with a light mace or heavy mace who is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC is also hindered by the attack.

DESC:[Initial Benefit] You can add your Charisma bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls when wielding a starknife. If you do so, you don't modify attack rolls and damage rolls with your starknife with your Strength modifier, your Dexterity modifier (if you have Weapon Finesse), or any other ability score (if you have an ability that allows you to modify attack rolls and damage rolls with that ability score).																																									DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Dex 17; Divine Fighting Technique; Point-Blank Shot; Rapid Shot; base attack bonus +11 or Sleight of Hand 11 ranks.	DESC:[Optional Advanced Prerequisite] A chaotic good bard of at least 10th level who worships Desna can replace a versatile performance with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.										DESC:[Advanced Benefit] You can impart a powerful spin to a thrown starknife so that multiple blades strike the target rather than just a single blade of the four, dealing extra damage with the other blades. As a full-round action, you can make a single attack with a thrown starknife, rolling 1d4 to determine how many effective strikes you gain with the attack (if you roll a 1, then only one blade strikes). If the attack hits, all of the effective strikes damage the target. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack damage) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. The damage bonus from your appropriate ability score modifier applies to each strike, as do other damage bonuses, such as a bard's inspire competence bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each strike.
Erastil's Distracting Shot		KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Erastil's Distracting Shot			NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:[Optional Prerequisite] A lawful good ranger who worships Erastil can choose Divine Fighting Technique as the bonus feat granted by his combat style if he chooses archery as his combat style.	DESC:[Initial Benefit] As a standard action, you can fire a distracting shot from your longbow or shortbow; when you do, select one ally who is adjacent to the creature you are targeting with the distracting shot.

Irori's Perfected Fist			KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Irori's Perfected Fist			NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:[Optional Prerequisite] A lawful neutral brawler or monk can replace a bonus feat with the following initial benefit.													DESC:[Initial Benefit] You can take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls made with your unarmed strikes in order to deal the average amount of damage with each successful attack instead of rolling your weapon damage. For instance, if your unarmed strike would normally deal 1d4 points of weapon damage, you instead deal 2 points of weapon damage. Apply bonuses and modifiers to this result as if you had rolled your damage normally. You must choose to use this benefit before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. You do not average additional damage dice (such as those granted by a sneak attack) when using this ability.		DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Critical Focus; Divine Fighting Technique; Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +10 or monk level 10th.

DESC:[Advanced Benefit] You no longer take a –2 penalty on attack rolls with your unarmed strikes when you choose to deal the average amount of damage.

Lamashtu's Carving			KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Lamashtu's Carving				NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.29																																					DESC:[Initial Benefit] As a standard action, you can make a single attack with a falchion or a kukri in order to deal bleed damage to the target. When you make this attack, you do not apply your ability modifier (normally Strength, but potentially other modifiers) to the hit point damage dealt by your attack—instead, add an amount of bleed damage equal to this modifier. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or any amount of magical healing. Bleed damage from this benefit doesn't stack with itself.																						DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Str 13, Dazing Assault, Divine Fighting Technique, Power Attack.																																																						DESC:[Advanced Benefit] Whenever you hit a bleeding creature with a melee attack using a falchion or a kukri, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or become staggered for 1 round. Multiple attacks do not cause this condition to stack, and a creature that successfully saves against this staggering effect is immune to this effect for 1 round.
Norgorber's Silent Shiv			KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Norgorber's Silent Shiv			NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:[Optional Prerequisite] A neutral evil rogue of at least 2nd level who worships Norgorber can replace a rogue talent with the following initial benefit.							DESC:[Initial Benefit] Whenever you attack an opponent that is completely unaware of your presence (such as when you are using the Stealth skill or invisible), your attack deals damage as if you were one size category larger. This benefit applies only to the first attack that you make against the target, and only with attacks made with light or one-handed weapons intended for creatures of your size (including thrown attacks).																																						DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Divine Fighting Technique, Stealth 10 ranks.

If the result of your check exceeds the target's CMD, treat the target as if it were completely unaware of your presence for the purpose of the initial benefit of this divine fighting technique. If you beat the target's CMD by 5 or more, you also treat it as being completely unaware of your presence for the purposes of all class features and feats you have.
Rovagug's Thunder				KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Rovagug's Thunder				NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESCISPI:YES																																		DESC:[Initial Benefit] Whenever you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against an opponent, you deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. In addition, whenever your dirty trick combat maneuver check beats an opponent's CMD by 5 or more, you can forgo increasing the duration of your condition by 1 or more rounds to instead impose a –2 penalty on all of that opponent's Charisma-based checks. This penalty doesn't stack with itself, and it lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 minute) or until the target receives any form of magical healing.					DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Power Attack, Divine Fighting Technique, base attack bonus +10.										DESC:[Optional Advanced Prerequisite] A chaotic evil barbarian of at least 10th level who worships Rovagug can replace a rage power with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.

This benefit stacks with Penetrating Strike and Greater Penetrating Strike.
Sarenrae's Mercy				KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Sarenrae's Mercy				NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.30																																					DESC:[Initial Benefit] You take no penalty on attack rolls for using a scimitar to deal nonlethal damage. If your attack with the scimitar would normally deal additional damage (such as via sneak attack, the flaming weapon special ability, or the like), this additional damage can be nonlethal damage. You can also alter spells with the fire, good, or light descriptor and inflict spells so that the damage they deal is nonlethal damage instead. You can choose to apply this effect as the spell is cast.																										DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Great Fortitude, Weapon Focus (scimitar), Heal 10 ranks.																																																							DESC:[Advanced Benefit] Once per round as you strike a foe with a weapon and deal nonlethal damage with that attack, you regain 1d6 hit points as the warmth of Sarenrae's approval and the conviction that you are doing the right thing to minimize suffering infuses your body and soul. If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points. You can gain the benefit of this healing only once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks you make with the weapon. The advanced benefit of Sarenrae's mercy only applies against true and worthy foes. It does not apply against unconsious, helpless, or unaware foes or foes whose CR is less than your character level -2 (minimum 1). At the GM's discretion, if you are using this feat in a way that is not in keeping with the teachings of Sarenrae, such as healing someone and then beating them again to gain hit points for yourself, you may not receive healing.
Torag's Patient Strikes			KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Torag's Patient Strikes			NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.31																																					DESC:[Initial Benefit] Whenever you wield a warhammer, add your Wisdom bonus to the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make per round. These additional attacks of opportunity don't stack with those granted by Combat Reflexes, but this benefit counts as Combat Reflexes for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites and prestige class requirements. In addition, you can make attacks of opportunity while you're flat-footed.																																				DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Divine Fighting Technique, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (warhammer), base attack bonus +10.																																																		DESC:[Advanced Benefit] Once per round, before you make an attack of opportunity with a warhammer, you can declare an opportunistic strike. If the attack hits, you can apply the effects of your Vital Strike feat. You can apply the Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike feat instead if you have either of those feats. If you confirm a critical hit with an opportunistic strike, you can attempt a disarm or trip combat maneuver check against the target as a free action—this combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Urgathoa's Hunger				KEY:Divine Fighting Technique ~ Urgathoa's Hunger				NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Divine Fighting Technique.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.31																																					DESC:[Initial Benefit] A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can feast upon the life essence of a creature that you hit with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action. When you do so, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the scythe attack. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute and don't stack. The maximum number of temporary hit points you can gain from an attack is equal to your character level.																														DESC:[Advanced Prerequisites] Divine Fighting Technique, Heal 10 ranks, base attack bonus +7.																																																						DESC:[Advanced Benefit] A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can exacerbate any lingering contagions within a target's body upon making a successful melee attack with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action, and causes the target to immediately attempt additional saving throws against all diseases with which it is currently afflicted. Any failed saves cause the target to immediately take the effects of that disease, while a successful save does not count toward the number of consecutive saves that the target must succeed at in order to cure the disease.
