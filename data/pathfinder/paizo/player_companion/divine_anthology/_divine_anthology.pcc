DESC:Your Prayers Are Answered! Those who devote their lives to the gods receive potent gifts from their patrons. Pathfinder Player Companion: Divine Anthology presents many of these powers, both sacred and profane, along with the holy books in which they're found. The secrets revealed in these pages are not limited to those who can cast divine magic, thoughâ€”faith in the appropriate religion is the only requirement for using many of the revelations and ancient techniques hidden away in the prayer books detailed within.
