Diverse Obedience			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deific Obedience						PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=5												PREALIGN:Deity	DESC:Your intense faith in your deity allows you to gain boons not granted to most followers.												SOURCEPAGE:p.11	BENEFIT:You are treated as though you had 2 more Hit Dice than you actually do for the purposes of determining what divine boons you gain as a result of performing your deity's obedience. Diverse Obedience doesn't allow access to divine boons granted through prestige classes early, as those boons are tied to prestige class levels gained, not overall Hit Dice. If you take levels in a prestige class or archetype that offers accelerated access to a boon, this benefit may be superfluous. [THIS LAST PART IS NOT IMPLEMENTED!] Additionally, whenever you would gain a boon as a result of your Deific Obedience feat (and not through a prestige class), you can choose among the options available for evangelist, exalted, or sentinel boons. Once you make the selection, it is permanent, but you can choose from a different category each time you gain a new boon as you increase your Hit Dice.		BONUS:VAR|DeificBoonLVL|2|TYPE=Enhancement
