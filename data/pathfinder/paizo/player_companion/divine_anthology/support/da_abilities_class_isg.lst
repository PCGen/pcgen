They might see themselves as an incarnation of their deity in the flesh, or they could simply seek to embody the physical and spiritual ideals set forth by their deity. Many divine paragons go as far as to alter their appearance, as best as possible, to look similar to their chosen deity, but such a level of devotion is not required by the archetype.

Devoted Domain	KEY:Divine Paragon ~ Devoted Domain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Features.DivineParagonClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																																																						DESC:A divine paragon is intensely devoted to a single deity, and her alignment must be identical to her deity's alignment. She gains Deific Obedience as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the feat's prerequisites. She gains access to her boons at an accelerated rate rather than the standard HD-based rate granted by Deific Obedience (and as such cannot benefit from the accelerated rate granted by the Diverse Obedience feat). When the divine paragon selects her domains, she must designate one of the two domains she gains as her devoted domain. She gains all of this domain's granted powers and domain spells normally. For her other domain, she gains only its domain spells-she does not gain any of the granted powers of that domain. Instead, she must choose from the evangelist, exalted, or sentinel boons granted by her deity (as detailed in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods). [NOTE:PCGen is currently unable to delineate a non-devoted domain or remove powers from one. This must be done manually!] In order to retain access to her domain spells, the domain powers of her devoted domain, and the boons granted by Deific Obedience, the divine paragon must perform her obedience daily. If she fails to do so, she loses access to these abilities until she next performs her obedience (but she can still cast spells, channel energy, and perform other abilities granted by her cleric levels). This ability alters domains.

Divine Brand	KEY:Divine Paragon ~ Divine Brand		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Features.DivineParagonClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																				DESC:A mark appears somewhere on the divine paragon's body. The mark's location varies by individual and faith, but takes the form of the deity's holy symbol and generally appears in a location easy to display, such as on the hand, forearm, chest, or face. An uncovered divine brand functions as a holy (or unholy) symbol and as a divine focus for spellcasting. The divine paragon's aura is even more powerful than a typical cleric's as a result of her devotion, and her cleric level is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the strength of her aura when it is viewed by spells like detect good. This ability alters aura.

They are similar to divine paragons in many ways, but tend to focus more on their deity's combat prowess rather than seeking to become a physical manifestation of the deity's will.

When a divine champion gains boons from this feat, he gains the appropriate sentinel boon offered by his deity, rather than gaining the exalted boon.

Know the Infidel	KEY:Divine Champion ~ Know the Infidel	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Features.DivineChampionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																DESCISPI:YES	DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] The divine champion becomes an expert at combating enemies of his faith. He must choose a deity whose alignment is opposed to his own deity's alignment in at least one way (good versus evil or law versus chaos); preferably, he should choose a deity whose alignment diametrically opposes that of his own deity. If the divine champion worships a deity whose alignment is neutral, he must instead select a deity whose alignment is chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good. The choice of this enemy deity is subject to GM approval. At the GM's discretion, the divine champion may be allowed to choose a philosophy or religious organization that's not affiliated with a deity, such as the Green Faith, the Pure Legion, or the Whispering Way, but only if that philosophy or religious organization is an enemy of the divine champion's deity. The divine champion gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against followers of the enemy faith, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls made against them. Additionally, he can attempt Knowledge skill checks relating to the deity and its church untrained, even if the DC is higher than 10. Every 6 paladin levels thereafter (12th and 18th level), the divine champion can select an additional deity to oppose. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against the followers of any one deity he selected previously (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.

Fervent Boon	KEY:Divine Champion ~ Fervent Boon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Features.DivineChampionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																				DESC:A divine champion can call upon his deity for minor boons. By expending one or more uses of his fervor ability, he can cast one of the spell-like abilities included in his deity's first sentinel boon. By expending one use of fervor, he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants three uses of per day; by expending two uses of fervor he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants twice per day; and by expending three uses of fervor, he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants once per day. These uses don't count against any uses granted by the boon.
