In addition to shields, the shieldbearer can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the Weapon Focus feat; if he has multiple Weapon Focus feats, this ability applies to all of them. Whenever the shieldbearer hits with his sacred weapon, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The shieldbearer can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage-this must be declared before the attack roll is made. (If the weapon's base damage exceeds the sacred weapon damage, its damage is unchanged.) The shieldbearer's sacred weapon damage applies only to attacks when used with shields. This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon, and doesn't apply to alchemical items, bombs, or other weapons that only deal energy damage.

Sacred Shield								KEY:Shieldbearer ~ Sacred Shield						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Features.ShieldbearerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																			DEFINE:ShieldbearerSacredShieldEnhancement|0	DEFINE:ShieldbearerSacredShieldUses|0											DESC:At 4th level, the shieldbearer gains the ability to enhance his shield with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the shield a +%1 enhancement bonus (this bonus does not act as an attack or damage bonus when the shield is used in a shield bash). The shieldbearer can use this ability %2 minutes per day. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments, but they don't need to be consecutive. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the shield might have, to a maximum of +5. The shieldbearer can enhance his shield with any of the following armor special abilities: arrow deflection, blinding, fortification (heavy, light, or moderate), reflecting, and spell resistance (13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability's base cost (see Table 15-4 on page 463 of the Core Rulebook). Duplicate abilities do not stack. The shield must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other special abilities can be added. The enhancement bonus and shield special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses apply only while the shieldbearer is wielding the shield, and end immediately if the shield is removed or leaves the shieldbearer's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the shieldbearer's turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield. When the shieldbearer uses this ability, he can also use his sacred weapon ability as a free action by expending one use of his fervor.|ShieldbearerSacredShieldEnhancement|ShieldbearerSacredShieldUses																																																																																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|ShieldbearerSacredShieldEnhancement|min(5,WarpriestLVL/4)	BONUS:VAR|ShieldbearerSacredShieldUses|WarpriestLVL																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Channel Energy								KEY:Shieldbearer ~ Channel Energy						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Features.ShieldbearerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																												DESC:The shieldbearer can channel energy only when carrying a shield, and the ability manifests as a 30-foot-cone burst, rather than as a radius.

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Shieldbearer ~ Sacred Weapon.MOD																																																																																																																	DEFINE:ShieldbearerSacredWeaponEnhancement|0	DEFINE:ShieldbearerSacredWeaponEnhancementUses|0									DESC:Sacred weapon enhancement of +%1 for %2 rounds per day.|ShieldbearerSacredWeaponEnhancement|ShieldbearerSacredWeaponEnhancementUses|PRECLASS:1,Warpriest=7	DESC: At 7th level, the shieldbearer gains the ability to enhance one of his sacred weapons with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the weapon a +%1 enhancement bonus. If the shieldbearer has more than one sacred weapon, he can enhance another on the following round by using another swift action. The shieldbearer can use this ability %2 rounds per day, but these rounds need not be consecutive. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The shieldbearer can enhance a weapon with any of the following weapon special abilities: brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, frost, keen, and shock. In addition, if the shieldbearer is chaotic, he can add anarchic and vicious. If he is evil, he can add mighty cleaving and unholy. If he is good, he can add ghost touch and holy. If he is lawful, he can add axiomatic and merciful. If he is neutral (with no other alignment components), he can add spell storing and thundering. Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability's base cost (see Table 15-9 on page 469 of the Core Rulebook). Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other special abilities can be added. If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The enhancement bonus and special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves the shieldbearer's possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the shieldbearer's turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If the shieldbearer uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.|PRECLASS:1,Warpriest=7																																																																																																														BONUS:VAR|ShieldbearerSacredWeaponEnhancement|min(5,(WarpriestLVL-4)/3)	BONUS:VAR|ShieldbearerSacredWeaponEnhancementUses|WarpriestLvl
