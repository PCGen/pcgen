Once per day, you can tinker with a broken object to allow anyone who uses it to ignore the penalties for its broken condition for 24 hours (this does not affect the object's hit points). At the end of this time, it regains the broken condition (but you can use this trait on it over and over again).	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Pomp and Pageantry	KEY:Trait ~ Pomp and Pageantry				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Pomp and Pageantry],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait]		PRERACE:1,Halfling,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling	PREREGION:Taldor			DESC:Though others think you merely waste time, you know that those extra flourishes and ceremonial touches actually make your work just that much better.

The first time you attack someone with an attack that deals nonlethal damage, your target must make a Sense Motive opposed by your Bluff check minus the damage dealt to realize you actually intended to harm him; failure means he believe the injury was an accident on your part instead (though he may still want to punish you for it).

When you hit a foe you are flanking, you deal an additional 1 point of damage (this damage is added to your base damage, and is multiplied on a critical hit). This additional damage is a trait bonus.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Call for Help		KEY:Trait ~ Call for Help		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREDEITY:1,Chaldira Zuzaristan	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Call for Help],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]		PRERACE:1,Halfling,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling	DESC:Offering your devotion to and modeling your life on Desna's impetuous companion means you frequently find yourself in a jam but also ensures that you can always rely upon your friends to bail you out. When you take the total defense action, allies gain a +1 trait bonus on rolls made against a creature threatening you.																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Dawn Renewal		KEY:Trait ~ Dawn Renewal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREDEITY:1,Sarenrae			PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Dawn Renewal],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]		PRERACE:1,Halfling,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling	DESC:Your morning prayers often send a welcome spark of divine vitality into your most recent patients.

Each time you sleep, the GM tells you of a dangerous dream you had. Once per day, if you have to make a saving throw against a threat related or similar to that dream, you can roll twice and take the more favorable result. If you do not encounter circumstances similar to the threat or situation you dreamed, this trait has no effect that day. If you have the Halfling Jinx trait (see page 27), you cannot select this trait, and vice versa.	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Provider			KEY:Trait ~ Provider			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREDEITY:1,Erastil			PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Provider],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]			PRERACE:1,Halfling,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling	DESC:Few things exalt your faith more than feeding the hungry with your own honest sweat. You gain a +1 trait bonus on any d20 roll to acquire food or water for others. Though this bonus most often applies to Survival checks, it could also apply to attacking monsters that are safe and nutritious to eat (mainly animals and plants). However, Erastil takes a dim view of waste and of those who scorn his favor, and if you abuse this gift (for example, by using the bonus to defeat a bear, then only eating one bite of it), he punishes you with a -2 penalty on attacks, checks, and saves for 24 hours.							SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Self-Sacrifice		KEY:Trait ~ Self-Sacrifice		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREDEITY:1,Shelyn				PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Self-Sacrifice],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]		PRERACE:1,Halfling,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling	DESC:You honor your goddess through your willingness to take risks for those you care about.

You gain a +3 trait bonus on any Perception check made to identify any changes to a location that have occurred since you last visited it.																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Sensing Imperfection	KEY:Trait ~ Sensing Imperfection	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREDEITY:1,Irori				PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Sensing Imperfection],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]	PRERACE:1,Halfling,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling	DESC:Your belief in Irori has honed your ability to recognize when someone lies or dissembles.

Venom-Drenched		KEY:Trait ~ Venom-Drenched		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREDEITY:1,Norgorber			PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Venom-Drenched],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]		PRERACE:1,Halfling,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling	DESC:You have nothing to fear from one sort of poison. In fact, you can actually drink the toxic brew in order to make your blood dangerous. You are immune to one specific nonmagical poison (Core Rulebook 559). If you ingest a dose of that poison (even if it is a contact, inhaled, or injury poison), it remains in your system for 24 hours; any creature that bites you during that time is subject to the poison's effects.
