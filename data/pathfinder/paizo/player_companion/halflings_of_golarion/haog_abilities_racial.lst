This curse has a range of %1 feet, and you must be able to see the target and have line of effect to it. The target gets a Will saving throw to resist this jinx (DC = %2 [10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier]). If your target makes this saving throw, it is immune to your jinx ability for 24 hours. A jinxed creature takes a -1 penalty on all saving throws. This jinx lasts for 24 hours or until you attempt to use your jinx again. A jinx is a supernatural ability, is not mind-affecting, does not allow spell resistance, and can affect any kind of creature not immune to luck effects.|Halfling_HalflingJinx_Range|Halfling_HalflingJinx_DC	BONUS:VAR|Halfling_HalflingJinx_Range|30	BONUS:VAR|Halfling_HalflingJinx_DC|10+(TL/2)+CHA	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1 ft., DC %2)|Halfling_HalflingJinx_Range|Halfling_HalflingJinx_DC	FACT:Halfling_ReplaceHalflingLuck|true
