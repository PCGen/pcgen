CATEGORY=Special Ability|Urban Hunter ~ Animal Companion.MOD								DESC:.CLEAR		DESC:Urban hunters have animal companions that are domesticated animals or animals native to a major city. The urban hunter must select her animal companion from the following list: axe beak (Bestiary 3), badger, bird, camel, dire rat, dog, horse, llama (Pathfinder Player Companion: Animal Archive), ostrich (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Osirion, Legacy of Pharaohs), pony, ram (Bestiary 2), or trumpeter swan (Bestiary 4). In urban settings, an urban hunter's animal companion seems domesticated and likely harmless to anyone who has not seen it in combat (potentially reducing the DC of Diplomacy checks to convince anyone to allow it into secure areas). It draws no more attention than a friendly dog, loyal horse, or similar tame animal.
