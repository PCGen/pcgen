Cunning Caster			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deceitful		PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1		PRETEXT:Deceitful, ability to cast 1st-level spells.				DESC:Whether a smuggler or spy, you've learned to use misdirection and legerdemain to conceal your own magical abilities.												SOURCEPAGE:p.28	BENEFIT:When casting a spell, you can attempt a Bluff check (opposed by observers' Perception checks) to conceal your actions from onlookers. If the spell requires material components, you take a –4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell requires somatic components, you take a –4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell requires verbal components, you take a –4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell requires a focus or divine focus, you take a –4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell produces an obvious effect (such as a summoned creature or visible spell effect), you take a –4 penalty on the Bluff check, and even if your check is successful, observers still see the spell effect (though they fail to notice that you are responsible for it). All Bluff check penalties are cumulative.
Edge Runner				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13									PRETEXT:Dex 13.										DESC:You move with speed and assurance in places that cause others to fall into danger.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	BENEFIT:You can move at full speed while using Acrobatics to balance on narrow surfaces, and do not become flat-footed or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. You also gain a +4 bonus on Climb checks to catch yourself while falling. You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause you to fall into a pit (such as create pit or a pit trap). This bonus does not apply to your CMD against bull rush or trip attacks.
Filth Forager			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												DESC:Your regular exposure to the filth and unfortunate residues common to sewers and subterranean urban environs has caused you to develop a resistance to the effects of such conditions.	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 bonus on all saving throws against diseases and any effect that would cause you to become nauseated or sickened.																																																																																																																ASPECT:SaveBonus|+4 on save vs. diseases and effects that cause nauseated or sickened or sickened conditions.
Filthy Weapons			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (dungeoneering)=1,Knowledge (nature)=1					PRETEXT:Knowledge (dungeoneering) 1 rank, Knowledge (nature) 1 rank.	DESC:You spread contagion with your weapons by covering their business ends in virulent muck and sewage.															SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:You can take a standard action to cover a weapon in decomposing waste, slimy filth, or other virulent agent. The next attack with that weapon that succeeds against a foe exposes the target to filth fever. If the attack is a critical hit, the filth fever has an onset time of 1 round, and a %1 save DC.|10+BAB/2+INT
Guild Emissary			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Leadership,Underworld Connections				PRETEXT:Leadership or Underworld Connections.					DESC:Not only are you associated with a powerful thieves' guild or similar shadowy group, you are well-enough connected to gain benefits when dealing with the underworld in any settlement.	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:You can attempt a special character level check (1d20+%1) in place of a Diplomacy check when attempting to gather information. You can ask local contacts to find information for you. While this still takes the normal amount of time (typically 1d4 hours), you can gather information about multiple topics at once (up to a maximum of %2 topics). Additionally, when you are in a settlement no smaller than a small city and are seeking a magic item with a value equal to or less than the city's base value and the item is not available, you can check again after 1 day (rather than 1 week). If using the contact rules (Ultimate Campaign) you gain a single reliable contact each time you enter a settlement no smaller than a small city. This contact is randomly determined to be a fence, gossip, manipulator, merchant, petty criminal, snitch, or thug. The contact operates only within that city, and if the contact's Trust score goes down, it immediately drops to 1.|TL+CHA|3+CHA
Mud in Your Eye			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Throw Anything								PRETEXT:Throw Anything.									DESC:You are used to fighting in muck and slime, and happily hurl it in your foes' eyes in the heat of battle.														SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:As a standard action when in urban or subterranean terrain, you can scoop filth, sewage, mud, or similar grime off a nearby surface and hurl it at a foe as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 5 feet. If the attack hits, you can immediately attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target as a free action; this dirty trick can be used only to blind the target. As a ranged touch attack, this action provokes attacks of opportunity, even if your dirty trick attempts normally wouldn't provoke such attacks (such as via the Improved Dirty Trick feat). [Special] A character with favored terrain (as the ranger class feature) can use this feat when in any of his favored terrains in addition to urban and subterranean.
Rat Catcher				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (dungeoneering)=1		PRETOTALAB:1				PRETEXT:Knowledge (dungeoneering) 1 rank, base attack bonus +1.		DESC:You have a great deal of experience dealing with the subterranean pests common in cities.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:You gain a +1 dodge bonus against attacks made by creatures at least two size categories smaller than yourself, and gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against such creatures. Additionally, you take only half damage from swarm attacks, and as a full-round action can make a single attack with a natural or bludgeoning weapon against an adjacent swarm. If the attack hits, you deal half damage to the target, even if the swarm is small enough to normally be immune to such attacks.
Subtle Devices			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Stealthy									PRETEXT:Stealthy.										DESC:You are skilled at concealing your use of magic items with guile and deft tricks.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:When triggering a wand, staff or any other magic item, you can attempt a Stealth check (opposed by observers' Perception checks) to conceal the trigger from onlookers. If the magic item produces an obvious effect (such as a summoned creature or visible spell effect), you take a –4 penalty on the Stealth check, and even if your check is successful, observers still see the spell effect (though they fail to notice you are responsible for it).
Throat Slicer			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PRETOTALAB:1												PRETEXT:Base attack bonus +1.								DESC:Sometimes the only way to deal with those who see your illicit activities is to get rid of them.																SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:When using a 1-handed, light, or natural weapon, you can deliver a coup de grace to an unconscious, bound, or pinned target (though not other kinds of helpless targets) as a standard action.
Underworld Connections		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												DESC:You know people and things that interact with the underworld, whether through crime syndicate connections or friends that literally dwell beneath the surface.					SOURCEPAGE:p.29	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and Survival checks while underground or in urban terrain. Additionally, while within a settlement and attempting a check modified by that settlement's corruption, crime, or economy modifiers (GameMastery Guide), you can use your knowledge of local contacts to gain a +4 bonus on that roll. However, if the check fails, anyone witnessing your attempt sees you committing some violation of local law.
