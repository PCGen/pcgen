Cunning Caster					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deceitful					PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1											PRETEXT:Deceitful, ability to cast 1st-level spells.													DESC:Whether a smuggler or spy, you've learned to use misdirection and legerdemain to conceal your own magical abilities.

All Bluff check penalties are cumulative.
Edge Runner						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																														PRETEXT:Dex 13.													PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13	DESC:You move with speed and assurance in places that cause others to fall into danger.

SOURCEPAGE:p.29																				BENEFIT:You can attempt a special character level check (1d20+%1) in place of a Diplomacy check when attempting to gather information. You can ask local contacts to find information for you. While this still takes the normal amount of time (typically 1d4 hours), you can gather information about multiple topics at once (up to a maximum of %2 topics). Additionally, when you are in a settlement no smaller than a small city and are seeking a magic item with a value equal to or less than the city's base value and the item is not available, you can check again after 1 day (rather than 1 week). If using the contact rules (Ultimate Campaign) you gain a single reliable contact each time you enter a settlement no smaller than a small city. This contact is randomly determined to be a fence, gossip, manipulator, merchant, petty criminal, snitch, or thug. The contact operates only within that city, and if the contact's Trust score goes down, it immediately drops to 1.|TL+CHA|3+CHA

If the attack hits, you can immediately attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target as a free action; this dirty trick can be used only to blind the target. As a ranged touch attack, this action provokes attacks of opportunity, even if your dirty trick attempts normally wouldn't provoke such attacks (such as via the Improved Dirty Trick feat). [Special] A character with favored terrain (as the ranger class feature) can use this feat when in any of his favored terrains in addition to urban and subterranean.

BONUS:SITUATION|Knowledge (Dungeoneering)=Underground,Survival=Underground,Knowledge (Dungeoneering)=Urban,Survival=Urban|2	SOURCEPAGE:p.29																				BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and Survival checks while underground or in urban terrain. Additionally, while within a settlement and attempting a check modified by that settlement's corruption, crime, or economy modifiers (GameMastery Guide), you can use your knowledge of local contacts to gain a +4 bonus on that roll. However, if the check fails, anyone witnessing your attempt sees you committing some violation of local law.
