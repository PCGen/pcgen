Buskers commonly use their skills to entertain for a few coins, but also pick pockets, hide in plain sight as statues, and manipulate the desperate in medicine shows. Many buskers are also jugglers (Pathfinder Player Companion: Ranged Tactics Toolbox).

He can use this ability for %1 rounds per day. Maintaining a stunt is a free action, but it ends immediately if the busker is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. This ability is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, and other effects that affect bardic performance. Like a bardic performance, a busker stunt cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities.|BardicPerformanceDuration																																																																																																					ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Quick Hands|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Patter|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Living Statue|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,3	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Fascinate|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,6	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Suggestion|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,8	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Inventive Juggler|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,9	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Impossible Sleight of Hand|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,15	BONUS:VAR|BardicPerformanceDuration|4+CHA	BONUS:VAR|BardicPerformanceLVL|BardLVL																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|BardicPerformanceDuration	ASPECT:CheckType|Rounds per day	ASPECT:MasterAbility|Busker Stunts
Flexible Performer		KEY:Busker ~ Flexible Performer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.BuskerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																										DESC:A busker can attempt Acrobatics, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks to earn money instead of Perform checks. He can use his Bluff modifier in place of his Diplomacy modifier on Diplomacy checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.27

Quick Hands				KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Quick Hands			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance																																																																							DESC:As a swift action, a busker can call on his stunts to gain a +%1 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks, a +%1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and a +%1 bonus on attack rolls as if from haste.|1+((BardLVL+1)/6)	DESC: While maintaining this stunt the busker also gains an extra attack at his highest base attack bonus as if from haste.|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,5																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Patter				KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Patter				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance																																																																							DESC:A busker can engage in brisk conversation that seems innocuous, but actually encourages creatures to reveal secrets to the busker. Each round while maintaining this stunt, the busker can force one creature within 30 feet that is able to see and hear the busker and has an attitude of indifferent or better towards him to attempt a Will save (DC %1). On a failed save, the target must answer one yes/no question the busker asks to the best of its ability. Anyone observing this (including the creature asked, even if it succeeds at its save) must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the busker's Bluff check) to realize the question was asked or answered. A target that feels threatened or is in combat is immune to this ability. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting enchantment effect.|10+(BardicPerformanceLVL/2)+CHA																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Living Statue			KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Living Statue			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance																																																																							DESC:A busker can use this stunt to hold perfectly still. While maintaining this stunt the busker can attempt a Bluff check (opposed by all observers' Sense Motive checks) to appear paralyzed, dead, or as a statue (this requires that the busker be disguised to look as though he were made of stone or metal, which is aided with a statue disguise kit). Even magical means of determining the true nature of the busker do not function for an observer that fails this check. If the busker takes any physical actions, this stunt ends.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Fascinate				KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Fascinate				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance																																																												DEFINE:FascinateCreatures|0	DEFINE:FascinateDC|0			DESC:A busker can use this stunt to cause up to %1 creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the busker, and capable of paying attention to him. The busker must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents this ability from working. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC %2) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the busker cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the busker's performance for as long as he continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.|FascinateCreatures|FascinateDC																																																																																																																					BONUS:VAR|FascinateCreatures|(BardicPerformanceLVL+2)/3	BONUS:VAR|FascinateDC|10+(BardicPerformanceLVL/2)+CHA																													SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Suggestion				KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Suggestion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance																																																													DEFINE:SuggestionDC|0								DESC:A busker can use this stunt to make a Suggestion (as per the spell) to a creature he has already fascinated. Using this ability does not disrupt the Fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the Fascinate effect). The busker can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Making a Suggestion does not count against the daily use of Busker Stunts. A Will saving throw (DC %1) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.|SuggestionDC																																																																																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|SuggestionDC|10+(BardicPerformanceLVL/2)+CHA																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Inventive Juggler			KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Inventive Juggler		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance																																																																							DESC:A busker masters unconventionally dangerous juggling techniques. While maintaining this stunt, the busker can use a thrown weapon (even an improvised one) to threaten spaces as though he were using a reach weapon. The busker treatens squares up to %1 feet away from him with thrown weapons|((BardicPerformanceLVL-6)/3)*10																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Impossible Sleight of Hand	KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Impossible Sleight of Hand	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance																																																																							DESC:A busker can store items in or retrieve them from a personal extradimensional space with a maximum capacity of 8,000 cubic feet and 8,000 pounds as a busker stunt. The item may be sent from or called to his hand or any place it fits on his person. He can access the extradimensional space only to store or retrieve a single object at a time; to retrieve or store an object larger than Fine size, the busker must expend 1 additional round of busker stunts for each size category larger than Fine. This stunt is instantaneous and must be activated again each time the busker wishes to use it. The extradimensional space empties its contents within the busker's space if he dies.

Controlled Bloodrage		KEY:Urban Bloodrager ~ Controlled Bloodrage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodrager Class Features.UrbanBloodragerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Bloodrage																																																																					DESC:When an urban bloodrager rages, she does not gain the normal benefits. Instead, she can apply a +4 morale bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater bloodrage and to +8 when she gains mighty bloodrage. She can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. When using a controlled bloodrage, an urban bloodrager gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Charisma-, Dexterity-, and Intelligence-based skills. A controlled bloodrage still counts as a bloodrage for the purposes of any spells, feats, and other effects.

When the bloodrager casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the spell's area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn't been targeted or wasn't in the area.

She can select from the bard or magus spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another.
