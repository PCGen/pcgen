When the target retrieves an item stored on itself, it can retrieve the item either as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity, or as a swift action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:With a touch, you conjure an extradimensional space inside a pouch or pocket. The pocket acts as a bag of holding, except it can hold only (10*CASTERLEVEL) pounds. Regardless of what is placed into the pocket, it weighs 3 pounds. Unlike a bag of holding, the pocket created by this ability cannot be overloaded or rupturedany additional material simply spills out of the topnor does it have any special interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces. An arcane pocket grants you a +1 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal its contents. The pocket becomes nonmagical, spilling all of its contents onto the ground unharmed, if it leaves your possession or you create a new arcane pocket. [Material Components] a pocket and a silver button
Authenticating Gaze	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Inquisitor,Occultist,Sorcerer,Wizard=1							SCHOOL:Divination									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,DF/M	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes															SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:Your understanding of the written word becomes analytical and discerning. You gain a + min(10,CASTERLEVEL) insight bonus on Appraise checks to determine the value of books and scrolls and on Linguistics checks to detect forgeries, and you can attempt a Linguistics check to detect a forged document at a glance, rather than taking the normal 1 round of examination per page. In addition, you immediately detect whether written works within 30 feet and within your line of sight have a magical aura and the strength of any such auras, as though you had concentrated on each written work for 1 round using detect magic. [Material Components] a miniature magnifying glass or spectacles
Codespeak		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Inquisitor,Medium,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=2				SCHOOL:Transmutation									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,M	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:You and up to (CASTERLEVEL/2) willing creatures, all within 30 ft.		DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:No						SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.24		DESC:All recipients gain the ability to speak, write, and understand a unique language. This language sounds like random syllables and looks like written gibberish to anyone not under the spell, but the targets understand each other perfectly. Once the spell expires, any codespeak writing is unintelligible even to the targets. Each spellcaster creates a unique but constant secret language, and later castings of codespeak by the same caster allow new targets to understand messages left behind by others affected by the same spellcaster. Comprehend languages does not enable a caster to understand the language of another’s codespeak spell, but it does reveal that the targets are speaking a magical language. Tongues and similarly powerful spells translate codespeak normally. Add your caster level to the DCs of Linguistics checks when attempting to decipher messages written in codespeak. [Material Components] a knotted serpent's tongue
Compel Tongue		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard=1|Cleric,Druid,Medium,Mesmerist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2						SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One creature									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.24		DESC:This spell functions as share language (Advanced Player’s Guide 243), granting a creature the ability to read, understand, and communicate to the best of its ability in any one language you know. For the spell’s entire duration, the target can speak and write only in the language imparted, but its ability to understand other languages is unaffected. [Material Components] a wooden block carved with a letter
Compel Tongue (Mass)	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Medium,Mesmerist=4|Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5						SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, all within 30 ft.					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.24		DESC:This spell functions as compel tongue, except it affects multiple creatures. The same language restriction applies to all creatures, and the same language must be imparted to all creatures affected by the same casting of this spell.
Contact High		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard=2|Cleric,Mesmerist,Shaman=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Living creatures touched (up to (CASTERLEVEL))				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:While under the effects of a drug, you can duplicate those effects in others. You can touch another creature once per round (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is unwilling). When touched, the target begins experiencing the effects of the same drug by which you are currently affected (select one, if you are under the influence of more than one drug). The target doesn’t take any ability damage or risk addiction from the drug. You cannot impart the effects of any potion, poison, elixir, or mutagen currently affecting you.
Curse of Keeping	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Mesmerist,Shaman,Witch=2									SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Curse			CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,DF	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days				SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:You curse the target with the inability to sell, barter, or give away any item it owns, other than ordinary currency, for as long as the spell remains in effect. The target cannot sell, trade, drop, or give away possessions. The target can purchase items using ordinary currency but can't then sell the purchased items. The target can accept gifts from others but can’t offer anything in exchange. A curse of keeping can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect a curse of keeping.
Evaluator's Lens	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Inquisitor,Summoner=2|Occultist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until discharged												SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:You summon an insubstantial lens of force 4 inches in diameter that hovers in front of your face. When you attempt a saving throw against a spell with the figment or pattern descriptor, you can roll twice and take the higher result. You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Appraise checks to appraise the worth of an item viewed through the lens, and you never judge an item’s value wildly inaccurately. If you successfully identify that the item has magical properties, you can immediately attempt a Spellcraft check to determine the item’s properties, as if you had cast detect magic on the item and examined it for 3 rounds. This spell cannot determine the properties of artifacts. The lens cannot be targeted or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The lens’s AC against touch attacks is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
Fleeting Defect		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Bloodrager,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Transmutation									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One solid object that does not have the broken condition, or one construct	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]			SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless, object); see text	SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:You cause a single object to temporarily gain the broken condition. The target must be a single solid object, regardless of its composition, weighing up to (10*CASTERLEVEL) pounds. Attended objects are allowed a Fortitude save. When this spell ends, the object reverts to its original quality. An item destroyed while under the effects of this spell remains destroyed when this spell ends. This spell can be cast on a single construct to disrupt its animating force. A construct that fails its saving throw takes a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for the duration of the spell.
Fleeting Memory		TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Mesmerist=2|Bard,Occultist,Psychic=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V		RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]			SAVEINFO:Will partial					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.24		DESC:You create a gap in the target’s memory, preventing the target from remembering anything that happens from the moment you cast this spell until the moment its complete duration ends. Fleeting memory doesn’t wipe out its target’s memories until the end of its duration, so the target can remember the preceding rounds until the spell’s duration ends. If the spell ends prematurely, either because you dismiss it or because it is dispelled, it disperses without affecting its target’s memory. Whether or not the target’s save is successful, the target forgets that you cast a spell.
Fleeting Memory (Mass)	TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Mesmerist=5|Bard,Occultist=6|Psychic=7|Sorcerer,Wizard=8						SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V		RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, all within 30 ft.

Imbue with Addiction	TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Alchemist=2|Mesmerist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One living creature								DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:The target immediately becomes addicted to the drug used as the material component during the casting of the spell. If the target was ever addicted to the drug at any point in the past, it takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw. [Material Components] a dose of an addictive drug or substance
Incendiary Runes	TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Occultist,Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Abjuration				DESCRIPTOR:Fire				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.				DURATION:Permanent until discharged [D]			SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This spell functions as explosive runes, except it creates a small surge of flames rather than an explosion of force. The runes automatically deal 1d6 points of fire damage to any creatures and objects in adjacent squares, and those creatures and objects catch fire unless they succeed at Reflex saves.
Night Blindness		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Bloodrager,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1|Cleric,Shaman,Spiritualist=2	SCHOOL:Necromancy				DESCRIPTOR:Curse			CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One living creature								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days [D]				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:Your target’s vision becomes impaired as if the light level were one step lower, treating bright light as normal light, normal light as dim light, and dim light as darkness. In addition, the subject gains no benefit from darkvision, low-light vision, or the see in darkness ability. The subject gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist the blind or dazzled condition caused by bright light (such as flare). Remove blindness/deafness dispels night blindness.
Peerless Integrity	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer						CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,DF	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you					DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:None or Will negates; see text			SPELLRES:None			SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:Peerless integrity conceals the alignment of creatures from divination magic. All creatures within the spell’s area, including you, appear to have lawful good auras for the purposes of divination spells and effects that reveal alignments (such as detect law and see alignment), instead of their actual alignments. If the caster of such divination magic succeeds at a Will save, the caster recognizes whether the readings are true or false. Any creature under the effects of this spell gains a +2 circumstance modifier on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (such as detect thoughts or discern lies) and does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on targeted creatures’ alignments.
Pesh Vigor		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Bloodrager,Cleric,Druid,Magus,Medium,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Transmutation									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Living creature touched							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds; see text			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its Strength. Once per round as a free action, the target can choose to increase the enhancement bonus by 2 for 1 round; if it does so, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and the spell’s duration decreases by 1 additional round. For every 5 caster levels you have, the target can choose to increase the enhancement bonus by an additional 2, taking an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and decreasing the duration by 1 additional round per increase to the Strength bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +10 and 4d6 points of nonlethal damage at caster level 15th. The subject can’t spend more rounds than remain in the duration. When the spell ends, the subject becomes fatigued. [Material Components] a dose of pesh worth 15 gp
Remarkable Legerdemain	TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=2											SCHOOL:Transmutation									CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]														SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:While this spell is in effect, your body and clothing flutter and distort subtly, allowing you to conceal items with uncanny skill. You treat any object you can hold in one hand as a coin-sized object for the purposes of Sleight of Hand checks to palm the object or make it disappear; however, you can hide only one such item per caster level on your person at one time. This effect does not change the actual sizes of the objects.
Secret Coffer		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3											SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning						CASTTIME:10 minutes		COMPS:V,S,F	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:One small chest or coffer and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods			DURATION:14 days or until discharged			SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This spell functions like secret chest, except the coffer is only 1 foot square and can contain only 1 cubic foot of goods, and the container can remain safely hidden on the Ethereal Plane for only 14 days before it risks becoming lost. The spell automatically fails if a living creature enters the coffer. The coffer used as a focus for secret coffer must cost at least 500 gp, and its replica costs 5 gp.
Secret Sign		TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Bard,Inquisitor,Shaman=1|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer						CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One creature or object							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days				SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)				SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:You invisibly inscribe a small mark or short message (no more than 25 words) on a creature or object, similar to the way arcane mark works. The sign can be no more than 6 inches across, and if it’s a written message, it can be in any language you can read and write at the time of the spell’s casting. As you cast the spell, you can define one auditory, olfactory, tangible, or visual criterionsuch as all creatures wearing green bands on their left arms or only creatures who smell of lavender or only orcsthat allows designated creatures within 30 feet to see the secret sign. Disguises and illusions that mimic the set criterion can fool this spell. Normal darkness doesn’t conceal a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Auditory criteria (such as a password) and tangible criteria (such as pressing your hand against a specific object or wall) can be performed by anyone who learns of them. A secret sign cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb, but can differentiate apparent races, genders, and garments. See invisibility and invisibility purge reveal the sign, but glitterdust does not. A caster of at least 10th level can make secret sign permanent on an object with a permanency spell using 5,000 gp of diamond dust as a material component. [Material Components] a lemon peel
Secret Vault		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=8											SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning						CASTTIME:10 minutes		COMPS:V,S,F	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:One chamber and up to (10*CASTERLEVEL) cu. ft. of goods			DURATION:360 days or until discharged			SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:This spell functions like secret chest, except it affects a small structure, vault, or oversized chest. Living creatures within a secret vault don’t cause the spell to fail. While the vault is stored on the Ethereal Plane, living creatures within the vault don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe, but they can’t leave the vault except via magic such as plane shift. The vault used as a focus for secret vault must cost at least 25,000 gp, and its replica costs 250 gp. A secret vault has only a 1%% cumulative chance per day of becoming irretrievably lost after 360 days.
Vacuous Vessel		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=0											SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer						CASTTIME:1 swift action		COMPS:V		RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Container touched								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]			SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text				SPELLRES:Yes; see text		SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:This spell makes a single bag, chest, sack, or other container look and feel empty. The container must be no larger than (CASTERLEVEL) cubic feet or the spell fails. Anyone peering into or reaching into the container must succeed at a Will save or perceive the container as being completely empty. All items within the container when the spell was cast are still present, but they can’t be noticed unless removed from the bagsuch as by someone who can perceive them, or who upends the container. Casting vacuous vessel on another container or placing a new item in the existing container immediately dismisses the currently active spell.
Venomous Promise	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Mesmerist,Shaman,Witch=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation				DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent|Poison	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:S,M	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One creature									DURATION:Permanent or until triggered			SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.25		DESC:You guard your words and person with poisonous power. You can impart a short amount of informationup to 25 wordsas you cast this spell, entwining your words with the poison provided as a material component. If your target reveals the information you impart (verbally, in writing, with gestures, or by having its mind read with spells like detect thoughts), the target is immediately exposed to the poison (and is allowed any saving throw the poison allows). Your target instinctively knows that revealing this information will endanger it, but doesn’t automatically understand why or how. Neutralize poison removes the effect of this spell; the spellcaster must succeed at a caster level check against the spell’s save DC rather than the poison’s. [Material Components] a vial of poison

Euphoric Cloud																										SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Poison					COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (see text)				SPELLRES:no								DESC:You create a bank of fog similar to that created by fog cloud except its vapors are intoxicating. Living creatures in the cloud become fascinated. This condition lasts as long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Any creature that succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. [Material Components] rare mushrooms worth 5 gp
#Reproduced from ARG for archetype/feat support
Absorbing Inhalation																									SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Air					COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to (CASTERLEVEL) 10-ft cubes								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:See description						SPELLRES:No								DESC:You grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing you to harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or similar cloud-like effect. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the effect's caster level) to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response. While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud's original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud ends this spell. If you do not exhale the cloud before this spell's duration expires, you suffer the cloud's effects.
