Creating an arcanotoxin is a standard action, and it can be applied to a weapon as a move action.

At 3rd level and every 2 alchemist levels thereafter, she can enhance her arcanotoxin in one of several ways. She can’t select the same improvement twice in a row. If an eldritch poisoner can deal different kinds of ability damage, she selects which ability to affect each time she creates a dose of arcanotoxin, and can willingly reduce enhanced aspects of her arcanotoxin, such as the save DC or onset time. Some discoveries apply secondary effects; a dose of arcanotoxin can cause only one secondary effect.
