As part of the casting, you can insert a single magic rod or magic staff into the weapon's extradimensional space, after which the space closes. For the spell's duration, a character wielding the transmuted weapon is also considered to be wielding the rod or staff as well. If the rod or staff can be used to make attacks, you can attack normally with the weapon or use the weapon as if it were the merged rod or staff. If the effect created by the rod or staff requires an attack roll to successfully strike a foe, you can make the attack roll as if you were making an attack with the weapon at its highest bonus (including any bonuses the weapon would normally receive) rather than just a normal attack with the rod or staff-doing so does not allow you to add the weapon's damage to the attack, but instead allows you to use your skill with the weapon to boost your chance of hitting with the rod or staff's attack, spell, or effect.&nl; At the end of the spell's duration, the merged rod or staff is ejected from the weapon. If you have a free hand, you can catch the rod or staff as a free action; otherwise, it drops to the ground. If the merged weapon is broken or destroyed during the duration of Aroden's spellsword, the merged rod or staff is similarly broken or destroyed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																															FACT:CompMaterial|(a magic rod or staff)

The combat maneuver for the bull rush is equal to 1d20 + your caster level. You do not have to move to push creatures more than 5 feet with this bull rush. If a creature you strike has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check to overcome its spell resistance the first time you strike it. If you fail, that creature is immune to the effects of this casting of banishing blade. The first time each extraplanar creature whose Hit Dice don't exceed your caster level is driven back at least 10 feet by this spell, it must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it is sent back to its home plane. Whether it succeeds or fails, that creature is staggered for 1 round and banishing blade's duration ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Large and larger creatures don't need to attempt a Climb check to climb over it.&nl; At your discretion, you can make the structure half as long but thicker by forming it into a berm consisting of a steep slope on each side. Characters moving uphill (to an adjacent square of higher elevation) must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square of steep slope. Characters running or charging downhill (moving to an adjacent square of lower elevation) must attempt a DC 10 Acrobatics check upon entering the first steep slope square. Mounted characters attempt a DC 10 Ride check instead. Characters who fail this check stumble and must end their movement 1d2 x 5 feet later.

This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to swell into Gargantuan vines and tendrils that erupt from the ground, reaching for any structure or any creature of evil alignment, functioning like black tentacles except as noted. When you are determining the tendrils' CMB, the tendrils use your caster level as their base attack bonus and have a +13 bonus due to their Strength. Any tendril that succeeds in grappling a foe deals 4d6+13 points of damage to the grappled creature. Additionally, the tendrils created by this spell can detect evil auras, as if they had spent 3 rounds observing all creatures and objects within the spell's area using detect evil, and attack and impede the movement of only evil creatures, though they also attack any structures in their area. Each structure suffers a single attack each round; your caster level acts as the base attack bonus for these attacks, and the tendrils deal 4d6+13 points of damage on each successful attack.

While in effect, this spell functions like nondetection, except it also foils divination spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don't target it. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal the wearer's presence, such as see invisibility, the spell works but the wearer simply isn't detected if the caster fails its caster level check. Likewise, scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the wearer do not work at all if the caster fails its caster level check.

When you call a creature using planar inquiry, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing). After hearing your request, if the creature has an appropriate Knowledge skill it can attempt a check to provide the information it has. If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 plus your caster level and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane.

The kind of outsider called doesn't alter the effects of the spell, but when you use planar inquiry to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type.

The item doesn't take damage or otherwise gain any condition; it simply ceases to be visible to or interact with the world in any way, as if it no longer existed. The oil vanishes with the item and leaves no residue, nor does it affect surfaces that handle or hold the item during its application. No spell or ability short of miracle or wish can locate or affect the item while it is under the effect of this spell. Though the item seems to not exist while under the effects of this spell, its own reality is consistent (it ages normally, and any ongoing effects upon it continue normally). The target object can be one size larger than Tiny for every 5 caster levels above 5th you possess.&nl; The target item returns to existence when the spell's duration expires. An item returns to existence in exactly the same location and condition it left. If the location no longer has room for the item, the item takes 1d0 points of damage (bypassing hardness) and is teleported to the nearest location that has room for it.

If the item has magical or alchemical properties, they become inert for the duration of the spell. If you are holding the item when you cast this spell, you can drain it into the bottle used as focus for the spell. Items with hit point damage or the broken condition regain 5 hit points/caster level if drained into a bottle in this way. The duration of temporary effects (such as applied poison or greater magic weapon) passes normally and may expire while the object is in liquid form. The liquid is clearly unsafe to drink, but if, for some reason, a creature does drink the liquid and the spell ends, the creature takes 3d6 points of damage, and brings up the solid version of the item as a standard action in a coughing fit.&nl; Any spell or effect that would disperse or dilute an object affected by liquefy forces the object to attempt a Fortitude save (using the effect's DC, or DC 15 for effects with no saving throws of their own, such as pouring a liquefied object into a stream).
