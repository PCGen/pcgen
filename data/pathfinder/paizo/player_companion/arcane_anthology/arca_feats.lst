Additionally, you can gain the boons from up to two preparation rituals at once. You must have access to both preparation rituals while preparing your spells, and must prepare at least three spells or formulae (discounting 0-level spells) from each book. If the rituals are both in the same book, you must prepare at least three spells from the spellbook of 1st level or higher for each preparation ritual from which you benefit.

#Extra Spontaneous Spell Mastery	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		BENEFIT:You are able to spontaneously cast spells that you have mastered more frequently than your peers.	DESC: You gain 1 additional use of your spontaneous spell mastery ability per day.	DESC:&nl;Special: You can take this feat multiple times.
Mask Focus					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General								PREMULT:3,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extend Spell],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nameless One],[PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=3]																									DESC:While benefiting from the Nameless One feat, the mask that you wear in order to gain the benefits of that feat satisfies the focus component of any spell you cast that requires a mask, such as eyeless vision. In addition, once per day you can apply the Extend Spell metamagic feat to an arcane spell without increasing the spell's level by adding your mask as a focus component. When Extend Spell is applied in this manner, its increase to duration applies only to effects that target you; other creatures use the spell's normal duration. For example, if you use this ability on the haste spell, the spell's effects last twice as long for you, but not for any other creature that you target with the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								BENEFIT:You can use your mask as an additional focus for your arcane spells, enhancing their power.
Masked by Fear				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nameless One	PREMULT:1,[PRECHECKBASE:1,Will=6],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Fighter ~ Bravery]																													DESC:By donning a mask etched with your greatest terrors and forgoing your identity in favor of a title that evokes what you most dread, you are able to eschew fear completely. While benefiting from the Nameless One feat, when you suffer the cowering, frightened, or panicked condition, that condition causes you to act as if shaken instead of imposing its normal effects. In addition, whenever you attempt a skill check (normally Intimidate) to demoralize an opponent, you gain a +3 bonus on the check.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											BENEFIT:You embody all that you fear while wearing your mask, rendering you untouched by doubt.
Masked Intent				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nameless One																																													DESC:While benefiting from the Nameless One feat, your intentions become especially difficult to read. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on opposed Bluff checks, and increase the DC by 4 to gather information about you using Diplomacy, to answer questions about you or your weaknesses or abilities using the appropriate Knowledge skill, or to identify any spells or spell-like abilities that you cast using Spellcraft. If you have 10 or more ranks in any of these skills, the bonus for that skill increases to +8.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									BENEFIT:Your masked face makes your intentions nearly impossible to discern.
Nameless One				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																				DESC:A character with this feat eschews all of her former identities, going as far as to render her former name completely inaccessible by mortal means. You perform an 8-hour ritual that requires the expenditure of 200 gp for rare oils, incense, and creation of a special mask. After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places. (For example, you could adopt the title "Blue Fox" or "Night Stalker", but not the title "Chelish Avenger" or "Spirit of the Mwangi.")&nl; At the ritual's conclusion, you must don the mask created for the ritual, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you're wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally.&nl; As long as you wear the ritual mask and do not reveal your connection to any past identities, any attempt to scry on you independent of your eschewed identities requires a successful caster level check with a DC of 10 + your hit dice. In addition, you are immune to effects that require the use of your name, such as the named bullet spell. While benefiting from this feat, you cannot wear any magic items in the head slot, as the mask used by this effect effectively occupies this slot (though this benefit is not magical for the purpose of dispel magic and other effects). In addition, you cannot attempt to impersonate a specific individual by any means, magical or nonmagical. If you ever reveal or confirm your connection to your eschewed identities, you immediately lose the benefit of this feat and gain 1d4 permanent negative levels as your discarded identities return. You cannot regain the benefit of this feat or remove these negative levels until you atone (as per atonement, as if restoring a class feature).																																										BENEFIT:You completely eschew your former identity, making you impossible to locate or even name.
#TODO: Add occult ritual prereq
Ritual Mask					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nameless One																																													DESC:While benefiting from the Nameless One feat, your masked identity affords you a greater spiritual connection when you act as the primary caster for an occult ritual you know. For any such occult ritual, you can attempt all required skill checks even if untrained in such a skill. If you are trained in such a skill, you instead gain a +3 bonus on your skill check.&nl; In addition, if you have the spirit class feature (as per the shaman class), you can use the ritualistic focus afforded by this feat to enhance your connection to any spirits with which you have communed. Once per day, when you use a supernatural ability granted to you by your spirit (such as a shaman spirit's hex or spirit abilities or a medium's spirit powers), you can increase your effective class level by 1 when determining the effects of that supernatural ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BENEFIT:You are able to use the mystic nature of your mask to enhance your occult powers.
Painful Blow				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vital Strike																							PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Arcana)=3									PRETOTALAB:6						DESC:When you use Vital Strike (or Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike), the creature you hit with the attack must treat the damage dealt as continuous damage until the beginning of your next turn. This forces the target to attempt a concentration check if it casts a spell. You can use this benefit twice per day, or three times per day if your base attack bonus is +12 or higher.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													BENEFIT:You have learned how to land blows so painful it is difficult for struck spellcasters to concentrate.
Spell Denial				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General								PREMULT:1,[PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13],[PREVARGTEQ:FeatDexRequirement,13]],[PRESTAT:1,CON=13,WIS=13]																									DESC:Select one school of magic. You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells of that school.	DESC:&nl;You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must select a different school of magic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SCHOOLS|ALL	SELECT:1																									ASPECT:SaveBonus|+2 vs. %1 spells|%LIST	BENEFIT:You have trained to better resist a specific form of magic.
