Blinding Water			KEY:Holy Water Assault ~ Blinding Water		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																											DESC:By uttering a short prayer as swift action, you can empower a vial of holy water with blinding light. If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Reflex DC 13 negates blindness). This even affects creatures that do not have eyes such as skeletons, but not creatures that don't rely on vision.																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:23
Concentrate Holy Water		KEY:Holy Water Assault ~ Concentrate Holy Water	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																											DESC:Through alchemical processes, you can refine multiple doses of holy water into a single hyperÂ­potent dose. To do so, you must possess two or more flasks ofholy water and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check that takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time. The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is 15 + 2x the number of doses you are combining. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is %1. A direct hit with a flask of concentrated holy water deals 2d4 points of damage + 2 points of damage x the number of doses of holy water used to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage x the number of doses of holy water used.|floor((skillinfo("TOTALRANK", "Craft (Alchemy)"))/2)																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:23

SOURCEPAGE:23
Healing Water			KEY:Holy Water Assault ~ Healing Water		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																											DESC:You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of ld8 points of damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:23
Holy Circle				KEY:Holy Water Assault ~ Holy Circle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																											DESC:You can replace the silver material component of a magic circle against evil spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases to %1 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20.|(CASTERLEVEL*20)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:23
Holy Water Splash			KEY:Holy Water Assault ~ Holy Water Splash	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																											DESC:When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water's splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you.
