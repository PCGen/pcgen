Ballad of the Homesick Wanderer			KEY:Masterpiece ~ Ballad of the Homesick Wanderer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece														DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.15		DESC:This poem of sadness and longing was developed by a Riftwarden bard seeking a way to fight summoned creatures without violence. Its otherworldly lyrics drive outsiders to return to their planes of origin.	DESC: This mournful poem beckons outsiders back to the plane on which they were spawned, making them pine for their true home. Any summoned non-native outsiders who can hear this performance must each succeed at a Will save or feel compelled to return to their home plane. If an outsider fails its save, each round of the performance expends 2 rounds of the remaining duration of any spell or effect that summoned that creature to the current plane (in addition to the normal duration that passes each round). Called outsiders who fail their Will saves against this masterpiece take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for the performance's duration. If the performer can't speak the native tongue of the outsider's home plane, the outsider gains a +4 bonus on its Will save against this effect. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round. Activation: 1 full round.

Dedicated Summoner					KEY:Herald Caller ~ Dedicated Summoner			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Features.HeraldCallerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:A herald caller depends on summoned allies to overcome her foes, which affords her little experience with the martial pursuits typical of other clerics and a narrower spiritual focus. A herald caller can choose only one domain from her deity's list of domains, rather than the normal two domains, and she doesn't gain proficiency with medium armor or shields.

Divine Heralds						KEY:Herald Caller ~ Divine Heralds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Features.HeraldCallerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:A herald caller can use summon monster spells only to summon creatures particularly appropriate to her deity. This includes all creatures listed as summon monster options for priests of her deity, creatures whose alignment matches at least one aspect of her deity's alignment, and creatures of an elemental subtype that matches a domain granted by the deity (if any). When summoning a creature that is normally summoned with the celestial or fiendish template, a herald caller of a chaotic deity can instead summon it with the entropic template, and a herald caller of a lawful deity can instead summon it with the resolute template. Because of these summoned monsters' strong ties to the herald caller's deity, the herald caller also gains specific benefits with creatures she summons with summon monster spells gained from her cleric spell list. The herald caller and her summoned monsters can understand each other's spoken words as if they shared a common language (though this doesn't give summoned monsters the ability to speak if they normally lack it). Whenever the herald caller uses channel energy to heal, she can include all of her summoned monsters, even if they are out of her normal channel energy radius or of a creature type that would not normally be affected. If she channels energy to deal damage, she can exclude any of her summoned monsters that would normally be affected.

Elemental allies are most common in Qadira, where they are considered similar to genie-binders.

Elemental Eidolons					KEY:Elemental Ally ~ Elemental Eidolons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Features.ElementalAllyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] An elemental ally has four elemental eidolons she can summon, one each for the elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Their abilities and statistics are determined using the rules for elemental eidolons for the summoner class from page 33 of Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, as if the elemental ally were a summoner of her druid level, except they gain no additional evolution pool (just those evolutions from their base form and base evolutions from their subtype). Each of the four elementals has its own base form, skills, and feats. The elemental ally can summon one of these elementals with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so. The elemental ally can't summon an eidolon or cast summon nature's ally if she currently has an eidolon summoned. She also can't summon an eidolon if she currently has a creature summoned through other means. If one of the elemental ally's eidolons is killed, she cannot summon any eidolons for 24 hours. The elemental ally can dismiss her eidolon as a standard action. As the elemental ally gains levels, her elemental eidolons' base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolons gain the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gain an evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for elemental eidolons, though any ability that would grant evolution points to an animal companion does work. The elemental ally does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon.
Elemental Empathy						KEY:Elemental Ally ~ Elemental Empathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Features.ElementalAllyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:An elemental ally can improve the attitude of a creature of the elemental subtype. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The elemental ally rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the elemental empathy check result. To use elemental empathy, the elemental ally and the elemental must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an elemental in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. An elemental ally can also use this ability to influence a non-elemental outsider with the air, earth, fire, or water subtype, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.
Elemental Magic						KEY:Elemental Ally ~ Elemental Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Features.ElementalAllyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:The elemental ally can target elementals (including her elemental eidolons) with any spell she casts that targets animals, even though elementals can't normally be targeted by such spells.
Elemental Resistance					KEY:Elemental Ally ~ Elemental Resistance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Features.ElementalAllyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:An elemental ally gains resist acid, cold, electricity, and fire 5.

This ability reveals whether the target has been conjured by a conjuration (summoning) or (calling) spell, and allows the counter-summoner to attempt a Spellcraft check to identify the spell that conjured it (using the same DC as if the counter-summoner had witnessed the spell being cast).

Morphic Savant						KEY:Summoner Archetype ~ Morphic Savant			CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.SummonerArchetype			PREALIGN:CG,CN,CE											DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:A morphic savant is an agent of change who draws power from the Abyss, Elysium, or the Maelstrom to fulfill whatever goals strike his fancy. Chaotic evil and chaotic neutral morphic savants often train with Blackfire Adepts in the hopes of learning greater powers of chaotic unmaking, and chaotic good morphic savants are most common as agents of the Bellflower Network.

Eidolon of Chaos						KEY:Morphic Savant ~ Eidolon of Chaos			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Summoner Class Features.MorphicSavantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] A morphic savant's eidolon must be of a chaotic alignment (if using the summoner from Pathfinder Unchained, the eidolon must have the azata, demon, or protean subtype). The morphic savant's eidolon has three base forms: biped, quadruped, and serpentine. Each form has the same feats and skills, but has its own set of evolutions. When the summoner meditates and regains his spell slots for the day, he can select any of the three base forms of his eidolon. The eidolon has 1 fewer evolution point than normal for an eidolon of the morphic savant's summoner level, and has 1 fewer skill point per Hit Die. This ability alters eidolon.
Morphic Monsters						KEY:Morphic Savant ~ Morphic Monsters			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Summoner Class Features.MorphicSavantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:Since a morphic savant's power is drawn from planar energies aligned with chaos, all the creatures he summons must be of a chaotic alignment. If a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead an entropic creature (Bestiary 2 p292). This also causes the morphic savant's summoning power to be less reliable than a standard summoner's. Each time he uses his summon monster spell-like ability to summon multiple creatures, there is a 50%% chance he summons one more monster than normal for the summon monster spell he uses, in which case the creatures remain for only 1 round per level (instead of 1 minute per level). Also, starting at 2nd level, the morphic savant can grant one 1-point evolution to all the creatures he summons with his summon monster spell-like ability. He can't grant an evolution that duplicates the function of, or has the same name as, any ability the summoned creatures already possess (for example, he can't grant a creature with a bite attack another bite attack), nor can he add an evolution that causes the summoned monsters to have more attacks than his eidolon's maximum number of attacks. The creatures do not have to be of the correct subtype to gain an evolution, but do have to meet any other prerequisites. This ability alters summon monster.

Lawful good unwavering conduits often work with Riftwardens to protect the integrity of the Great Beyond, while lawful evil unwavering conduits are commonly diabolists in Cheliax.

Eidolon of Law						KEY:Unwavering Conduit ~ Eidolon of Law			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Summoner Class Features.MorphicSavantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] An unwavering conduit's eidolon must be of a lawful alignment (if using the summoner from Pathfinder Unchained, the eidolon must be of the archon, devil, or inevitable subtype). Once selected, the evolutions of the unwavering conduit's eidolon cannot be changed when a new class level is gained (though they can be altered normally with the transmogrify spell; see Advanced Player's Guide p250). At least half the eidolon's skill points must be spent on skills in which the unwavering conduit also has ranks. The eidolon gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities of the conjuration, enchantment, and transmutation schools. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, and by an additional 1 for every 3 levels thereafter. The eidolon has 1 fewer evolution point than normal for an eidolon of the unwavering conduit's summoner level. This ability alters eidolon.
Unwavering Monsters					KEY:Unwavering Conduit ~ Unwavering Monsters		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Summoner Class Features.MorphicSavantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.17		DESC:Since an unwavering conduit's power is drawn from planar energies aligned with law, all the creatures he summons must be of a lawful alignment. If a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead a resolute creature (Bestiary 2 p293). This also causes the unwavering conduit's summoning power to be more set than a standard summoner's. Beginning at 3rd level, each time he uses summon monster to summon multiple monsters, rather than rolling a die to see how many creatures he summons, he receives a specific number (two creatures for 1d3, or four creatures for 1d4+1). If an item, spell, or ability would increase the number of creatures summoned, the set number increases by that amount. Also, starting at 2nd level, creatures summoned by the unwavering conduit receive a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities of the conjuration, enchantment, and transmutation schools. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, and by an additional 1 every 4 class levels thereafter. This ability alters summon monster.
