Thunder Call		KEY:Thundercaller ~ Thunder Call		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardInspireCompetence																																																												DESC:At 3rd level, the thundercaller can use her performance to unleash a deafening peal of thunder. This allows the thundercaller to spend a round of performance to create an effect similar to the spell sound burst (having the same range and area and allowing the same saving throw). At 7th level, the sonic damage that is dealt by this blast of sound increases to 3d8. This damage further increases to 5d8 at 11th level, 7d8 at 15th level, and 9d8 at 19th level.

This effect functions as a rage spell that lasts as long as the target can hear the bard's performance; however, unwilling creatures can be affected if they fail a Will save DC %1 (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. The bard cannot target himself with this ability. If the target has the rage class feature, it can instead immediately rage and stay in this rage without consuming rounds of rage per day as long as the bard continues performing. This mind-affecting effect requires audible components. This performance replaces suggestion.|10+CHA+(BardLVL/2)																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.11
