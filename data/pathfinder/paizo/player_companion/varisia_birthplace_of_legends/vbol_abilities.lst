#### SHATTERED STAR CAMPAIGN TRAITS
## The following campaign traits tie characters to the Shattered Star Adventure Path. Characters designed for this campaign should plan to be residents or new arrivals to the city of Magnimar. They should also either be members of the Pathfinder Society or nonmembers who have an interest in joining up at the local Pathfinder lodge.
# COMMENT: Need means to restrict the EQUIPMENT chooser to items with COST < 200 GP to complete the Alabaster Outcast Trait below.

A falling-out left you disowned and disinherited. Now you hope to get away from the city and find fortune enough to shame your former kinsfolk-goals which led you to the Pathfinder Society. Despite your exile, your name still carries considerable weight in Magnimar, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made within the city. Additionally, you start play with a noble's outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. Your last name is probably Derexhi, Kaddren, Mindurian, Niroden, Scarnetti, Valdemar, Vanderale, or Versade (but may be another of your choosing; see Magnimar, City of Monuments).

The Pathfinder Society in particular recognized your wanderlust and potential as an agent, and on more than one occasion you impressed or bamboozled their agents with your street smarts and finesse. Over the years, you fell out of favor with the Sczarni, and eventually left to pursue interests outside of simple banditry, though you still remember the lessons your criminal relations taught you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to pass hidden messages. Also, anytime you deliver a coup de grace, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.

You've been sent by the Pathfinder Society lodge in your home country to learn more about Varisia by experiencing the frontier firsthand. After arriving, you reported to the Magnimar lodge and placed your expertise at the venture-captain's disposal. To represent your experience in distant lands, choose a country other than Varisia as your homeland and gain one of the languages spoken in that country as a bonus language (see The Inner Sea World Guide). Additionally, choose one of the following skills: Handle Animal, Knowledge (geography), Linguistics, or Survival.

Your fascination with these relics has only grown in the years since, encouraging you to join the ranks of the Pathfinder Society so you can further quench your thirst for knowledge. Though you know little about the actual lore of the monuments, you've studied these colossal works extensively, developing an in-depth knowledge of some of the city's most famous landmarks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) checks made in Varisia due to your familiarity with its historical remnants. This bonus increases to +2 if the check relates to the city of Magnimar.

Becoming a Pathfinder seemed like an obvious decision, allowing you to travel throughout Varisia in your search for wealth, so you signed up right away. You brought with you a sharp eye and keen ability to distinguish fakes from the genuine article. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise checks.
