You take 3d6 points of damage as a horribly deformed creature of shadow crawls forth.

This ability only applies poison to the weapons your allies are currently wielding (the weapons they are merely carrying are unaffected), and there is no chance of accidentally poisoning yourself or your allies.

This creates difficult terrain in an area centered on your target with a radius equal to %1 feet. You movement is not impeded by the difficult terrain created by this effect. By expending two uses of mythic power when you use this ability, you can create an additional shock wave that extends beneath your target's feet in a cylinder with a depth equal to %2 feet. If this shock wave breaks the surface of the floor (such as if you used this ability on the second floor of a building), the area beneath the target collapses entirely and anyone in the area lands prone on the level below (possibly incurring falling damage in the process).|MythicLevel*10|MythicLevel*5																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.11				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

This weapon does damage as a +1 scythe of your size, and lasts for %1 rounds. By expending one additional use of mythic power, your blade gains the wounding ability. Although it only uses one hand, the scythe deals damage as though wielded with two hands. When you activate this ability, whatever you are holding in your hand is melded with your body for the duration of this effect. Any weapon used in your other hand counts as an off-hand attack, regardless of which arm you transform. You can only transform one limb at a time in this fashion.|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.11				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

You can expend one use of mythic power to change the spell or formula contained in a potion or extract to that of any spell or extract you have prepared of the same spell level. The resulting potion uses the caster level of the original potion. The new spell contained in the potion or elixir must be one that could normally serve as a potion. If the effect you are trying to use requires expensive material components, you must provide them at the time of the change. The DC of a Perception check to successfully identify the powers of the potion (normally equal to 15 + the potion's caster level) increases by %1.|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.20				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

While it's in this form, treat the familiar as an intelligent magic item with the familiar's mental ability scores but no magical abilities. You can add magical enhancements, intelligent item powers, and intelligent item senses as if you possessed the appropriate crafting feat. (For example, if your familiar transforms into a staff, you could craft it into an intelligent staff of fire as if you possessed the Craft Staff feat.) You must still pay for enhancements as normal. As a standard action, the familiar can transform into and out of its item form and does so in such a way that you can have it immediately equipped when the transformation is complete. While in item form, your familiar retains its original hit points, but gains the hardness of the item it transforms into. If your familiar takes enough points of damage in item form to become broken, it automatically reverts to its familiar form and cannot change to item form again until it is healed to its maximum hit point total. You must have a familiar to select this path ability.

Infectious Spell		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Infectious Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Archmage																																																								PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,3																																																										DESC:You know no limits when it comes to the potency and ravaging effects of your spells. Whenever you cast a spell that specifically targets a limited number of targets (such as “one creature/level” or “one or more creatures”) and has a duration longer than 1 round, you can expend one use of mythic power to make the spell infectious. Each round on your turn, so long as at least one creature is still under the effect of the infectious spell, the spell targets %1 additional enemies. The range of the spell is the same, but it originates from a creature currently affected by the spell (your choice). A creature affected by an infectious spell suffers all of the effects of the original spell (and may attempt any saving throws as appropriate at the original save DC), but the duration does not reset (meaning the effect ends for all affected targets when the original duration of the spell expires). A creature can only be targeted by a given infectious spell once per casting. Once a round passes without any additional creatures affected by the spell, the spell stops being infectious. This ability can only affect spells of level %2 or less.|MythicLevel|MythicLevel*2																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.20				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

You can expend one use of mythic power when casting any spell of the teleportation subschool to visualize your destination before you fully materialize there, gaining sensory information of the area as though via a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell. After gaining this sensory information, you can choose to alter your teleportation destination by up to 100 feet in any direction.

When bargaining with outsiders called via a Planar Binding or similar spell, you add +%1 on Charisma checks against the called creature and on caster level checks to prevent the creature from escaping your magic circle. In addition, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to half the Hit Dice of the outsider to attempt to bind the outsider to perform a task for up to a year and a day. The creature gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check to refuse this request. If the outsider agrees to carry out this request, it is bound to perform that task for up to a year and a day or until otherwise released (either by completing the task or by your will). You cannot regain that use of mythic power until the outsider is released, effectively decreasing your total number of uses of mythic power per day by the number of uses spent to bind the outsider.|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power
Star Walker				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Star Walker				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Archmage																																																								PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																																										DESC:You can transform your power to enable you to travel great distances. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to surround yourself with a bubble of air enclosed by a thin iridescent layer of force. While this bubble offers no protection from attacks, you can propel yourself through the air at great speed. As long as you concentrate, you gain a fly speed of 240 feet per round. If you cease concentrating, the bubble stops and then sinks 30 feet per round until it reaches the ground and collapses; you can expend one use of mythic power before the bubble collapses to regain control. In the void of outer space, the bubble's speed is much faster. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system takes 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond takes 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Ceasing concentration while in the void of outer space has no effect on the bubble--it continues traveling in the previously stated direction at the same speed until an outside force slows it down. The air in the sphere is constantly refreshed and kept at a constant temperature, protecting occupants from the void of space, but not necessarily the harsh climates of other planets or planes. By expending two additional uses of mythic power, you can increase the size of the bubble to a 10-foot-radius sphere and you can bring along up to 11 Medium creatures within the bubble. Other creatures can enter or exit the bubble freely.

Whenever you score a successful critical hit against an adjacent creature, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to potentially disable one of that creature's limbs. Mythic creatures receive a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC %1), while non-mythic creatures do not. An affected creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and one of its limbs (your choice) is mangled. If you choose to disable an arm, the creature drops anything held in that arm, cannot hold items in that arm, and makes natural attacks with that arm at a –4 penalty. If you choose to disable a leg, the target's base movement speed is halved. These penalties are removed when the Constitution damage taken from this ability is healed. Foes that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability, as are those with unusual anatomies (subject to GM discretion).|10+MythicLevel+STR																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.22				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

In order to use this ability, you must be able to run in a straight line for 1 minute. Any obstacles or impediments that prevent you from completing this sprint uninterrupted prevent you from being able to use this ability, though the expenditure of mythic power is not wasted. At the end of your 1-minute sprint, you attempt an Acrobatics check and leap a distance up to half the check's result in miles, rounded down to the nearest mile. This trip takes 1 round per mile, and you reach a maximum height at the apex of your arc equal to half the distance traveled. You do not take falling damage from using this ability. You must have a clear arc of travel to complete this jump; if you strike an obstacle mid-jump, you and the obstacle each take a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 × the number of miles you have left to travel. If this damage destroys the obstacle, you continue your jump; otherwise, your jump comes to an end and you fall, taking falling damage as appropriate.

This ability is generally ineffective in combat (except perhaps to sway the attitude of a crowd of bystanders or an unaffiliated neutral party) or against creatures that intend to harm you and your allies in the immediate future.|10+MythicLevel+CHA|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.29				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

Aim for the Eye			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Aim for the Eye			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster																																																									PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,1																																																										DESC:You can home in on your targets with uncanny and supernatural accuracy. You can make ranged sneak attacks from up to 60 feet away (rather than 30 feet). When calculating range penalties for ranged attacks, you are always considered to be one range increment closer to the target than you actually are. Whenever you successfully score a critical hit against a flat-footed creature with a ranged attack, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to blind that creature for 1d4+1 rounds. A mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC %1). Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability, as are creatures with unusual anatomies (GM's discretion).|10+MythicLevel+DEX																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.30				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

Whenever you feint, you can choose to feint against all opponents within 10 feet, using the same Bluff check for each opponent. If you expend one use of mythic power while you're feinting, any target you successfully feint against is considered flat-footed against the first attack any creature makes against it before its next turn. You must use this ability after your Bluff check is rolled but before the results are revealed.

The adjacent creature must be no more than one size category larger than the creature you just tripped. If this second trip is successful, you can continue to attempt to trip creatures as long as they are adjacent to the last one successfully tripped, taking a cumulative –4 penalty on each trip attempt after the first. In a round, you can trip %1 creatures in this way, and only until your first failed trip attempt. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping additional foes with this ability, and if you fail a trip attempt after the first there's no chance of you tripping yourself.

You can use Sleight of Hand to lift or plant objects as a move action with no penalty. When you use Sleight of Hand to steal something, the target takes a -%1 penalty on its Perception check to notice the theft. You can use Sleight of Hand to plant a small object on someone else. When doing so, you use the same method and bonuses as you would for lifting the same item.|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.30				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

You can tie a knot in any rope you hold, including turning it into a lasso, as a swift action. You can also use a whip, lasso, spiked chain, or similar weapon to constrict an opponent. In order to do so, you must make a successful attack with the rope-like weapon, after which you can, as a swift action, attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that creature, adding +%1 to your combat maneuver check. If you are successful, the creature is considered to be grappled, though you are not, and you can deal constrict damage to the creature equal to the amount of damage you could normally deal with the weapon used.|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.30				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

If you make an attack roll that misses your original target, you can expend one use of mythic power to specify a second target, which must be adjacent to you (if a melee attack) or the original target (if a ranged attack). If the second target would be hit by what you rolled, you hit that target and deal damage as normal.

This trap must be chosen from those listed on pages 420–422 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook (other traps may be allowed at the GM's discretion). The trap's CR can't be higher than %1, and the trap remains in the place you designate for %1 hours. As long as you have line of sight to a trap that you've summoned with this ability, created through other means, bypassed, or reprogrammed to your benefit, you can trigger that trap as a swift action, no matter your distance to it.|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.31				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

You gain a +%1 bonus on Acrobatics checks. You can move at full speed across any narrow or uneven surface, and can run across fragile surfaces that can't hold your weight (including liquids) without peril as long as you end your turn on a solid surface. You leave no tracks (as Pass Without Trace), and ignore adverse effects from nonmagical difficult terrain and ground hazards, including caltrops. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to balance on razor edges and pinpoints, allowing you to ignore damage from spiked pit traps and similar hazards for %1 rounds.|MythicLevel																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.31				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Mythic Power

Thereafter, every consecutive round that you deal sneak attack damage, add a cumulative +1d6 bonus on your sneak attack damage roll. The targets of these sneak attacks don't need to be the same. You can gain a maximum of %1 bonus d6s on your sneak attack damage in this way. As soon as you fail to deal sneak attack damage to a creature in a round, this effect ends and you no longer gain the bonus on sneak attack damage until you use this ability again.
