Shieldmarshal's Ward.MOD									EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Shield.Special Ability ~ Arrow Deflection ~ Shield.Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|8000				SOURCEPAGE:p.18						SPROP:If arrow successfully deflected, as a free action spend a mythic point to redirect the projectile toward another creature in line of effect using original attack and damage rolls.		DESC:Whenever the bearer of this shield successfully deflects a projectile using the shield, she can, as a free action, expend one use of mythic power to redirect the deflected projectile toward any creature to which she has a clear line of effect, using the original attacker's attack and damage rolls. The range increment penalty on the attack roll of this deflected projectile is calculated from the original point at which the projectile was fired. A character who possesses levels in the Shieldmarshal prestige class can bear a shieldmarshal's ward without penalty, even if she isn't proficient with it.

# Equipment Name					Product Identity?	Type								Cost			Weight	Modifier				Source Page
Blackblot										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous				COST:4200	WT:.5						SOURCEPAGE:p.18																																																																							DESC:A pitch-black powder made from pulverized marrowstone mixed with the dust of the Negative Energy Plane, blackblot interferes with life energy and mythic abilities. A handful of blackblot can be thrown onto a creature as a splash weapon. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If the target takes a direct hit, it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be rendered immune to positive energy, similar to the protection death ward offers against negative energy. Spells and effects that heal or harm based on positive energy, such as cure spells and channeled positive energy, have no effect on the target. This effect lasts for 1 minute. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the blockblot hits must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be immune to positive energy for 1 round. A mythic creature that takes a direct hit from a dose of blackblot must attempt an additional DC 16 Will save. If the creature fails, it can't expend mythic power for 1 minute, though mythic abilities that don't require the expenditure of mythic power function normally. The mythic creature can attempt an additional Will save each round; if it's successful, this effect ends. Blackblot is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes. The listed price is for 1 dose.
Essense of Wandering Dreams						TYPE:Magic.Wondrous				COST:5000	WT:0						SOURCEPAGE:p.18																																																																							DESC:This minute crystal vial contains a single drop distilled from the captured dreams of a hundred different worlds. The drop can be poured into a vessel of water, wine, or other drink, and shared between as many as nine recipients. If not drunk within an hour of mixing, it loses potency. The imbibers drift into sleep for at least 2d6 × 5 minutes (Will DC 17 negates). Anyone who sleeps for at least 2 hours receives a +2 insight bonus on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma-based skill checks for the next 24 hours. If an imbiber expends two uses of mythic power and envisions a destination as she falls asleep, she gains the benefits above and sleeps for 2 hours before waking on a plane of her choice as though using plane shift. Each imbiber who expends the uses of mythic power can travel to a different plane. All imbibers traveling to the same plane wake up at the same location on that plane. 
Token of the Eldest								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Headgear	COST:27680	WT:0						SOURCEPAGE:p.18					SPELLS:Token of the Eldest|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=9|Commune with Nature																																																	DESC:Once per day, the wearer of a token of the Eldest can use commune with nature. In addition to that spell's usual effects, if the area has a powerful natural protector likely to be helpful to the wearer, this protector automatically learns of the wearer and her location as well as a vague impression of her needs. Once per day, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to cast charm monster on a creature (DC 16 negates); fey creatures targeted by this effect take a –4 penalty on the saving throw. Finally, as an immediate action the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to reroll any saving throw against a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability of a fey, receiving a +2 bonus on the new saving throw. This ability must be used after the savebut before the results are revealed. The wearer must take the result of the second roll, even if it's worse.
Tyrant's Mark									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous				COST:70000	WT:0						SOURCEPAGE:p.19					BONUS:COMBAT|AC|3|TYPE=Deflection		BONUS:SAVE|ALL|3|TYPE=Resistance																																																DESC:As a free action after failing a saving throw, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to reduce any damage resulting from the failed save by half. When a tyrant's mark is created, it is keyed to a matching black diamond worth no less than 1,000 gp. The creator of a tyrant's mark can expend two uses of mythic power at any distance to use scrying (as the spell) on the pin's wearer while gazing through the black diamond, with the pin acting as the scrying sensor. The wearer of the tyrant's mark takes a –10 penalty on the Will save against the scrying effect, as though the maker had possession of a portion of the wearer's body.
