# Spell Name (MOD)								Mythic description
Aroden's Spellbane.MOD						DESC:Mythic: Add half your tier to the number of spells you can select to not function in the area. As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to change one of the spells blocked by this effect. You can do this as often as you wish during the spell's duration.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Aroden's Spellbane
Covetous Aura.MOD							DESC:Mythic: The duration of the Covetous Aura increases to 1 minute per level or until discharged. You may gain the benefits of spells of 5th level or lower cast within the aura's area of effect. You can gain the effects of two separate spells, after which the mythic Covetous Aura ends. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level or until discharged. You may gain the benefits of spells of 7th level or lower cast within the aura's area of effect. When you gain the benefit of a spell, the original spell is immediately targeted with a Greater Dispel Magic spell at your caster level. If the dispel check succeeds, the spell ends for any of the original recipients in the area of your covetous aura.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Covetous Aura
Crusader's Edge.MOD							DESC:Mythic: Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points. While wielding this weapon, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities originating from evil outsiders. Augmented (5th): You can expend two uses of mythic power to give the touched weapon the holy weapon special ability.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Crusader's Edge
Dirge of the Victorious Knights.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The damage increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d10). Any creature that fails its Reflex saving throw is knocked prone, and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area increases to a 240-foot line 20 feet wide. All cold damage dealt by the spell ignores cold resistance and cold immunity.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Dirge of the Victorious Knights
Fleshcurdle.MOD								DESC:Mythic: You can choose two effects instead of one effect, or may choose to enhance one effect. If you enhance the attack effect, all of the creature's natural attacks are affected. If you enhance the defense effect, in addition to Fleshcurdle's normal effect on natural armor bonus, any critical threats against the creature gain a +4 bonus on the confirmation roll. If you enhance the movement effect, all of the creature's movement speeds are halved. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can choose two enhanced effects to inflict upon the target.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Fleshcurdle
Geniekind.MOD								DESC:Mythic: The energy resistance granted by your genie form increases to 20. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. In addition, once while you are transformed you can use one spell-like ability based on your genie form (using your caster level), as detailed below. Djinni: Create Food and Water, Gaseous Form, or Major Creation (created vegetable matter is permanent); Efreeti: Pyrotechnics, Scorching Ray, or Wall of Fire; Marid: Control Water, Quench, or Water Breathing; Shaitan: Meld Into Stone, Rusting Grasp, or Transmute Rock to Mud. Such spell-like abilities end either when their duration has expired or when the duration of mythic Geniekind has expired, whichever comes first. Augmented (7th): If you expend three uses of mythic power, the energy resistance granted by your genie form becomes energy immunity. While you are transformed, you can change into a different type of genie as a full-round action. You can become each type of genie only once per casting, and you can use one listed spell-like ability in each of your different genie forms. The duration of the spell-like abilities ends when the spell's duration ends or when you change to a different genie form, whichever comes first.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Geniekind
Gorum's Armor.MOD							DESC:Mythic: The damage to attackers increases to 1d4 points of piercing damage and affects creatures that attack the wearer with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger a creature in this way. If you're wearing the armor and are taking bleed damage, the spikes lengthen and grow wicked barbs--this increases their damage against foes that strike you to 1d6 + 1/2 your caster level (maximum +5), and the spikes deal 1 point of bleed damage to any foe damaged by them. When your bleeding stops, the spikes immediately return to their normal size and any bleed effects caused by the armor end.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Gorum's Armor
Harrowing.MOD								DESC:Mythic: The bonuses and penalties associated with your reading are doubled, resulting in a +4 luck bonus if the card's and target's alignment are identical, a –2 penalty if the alignments are opposite, and a +2 luck bonus for any other alignment. You can use each bonus twice--once at this doubled value, the second time at the normal value (+2 or +1). You must use a given card's doubled bonus before you can use its lower bonus. Once you have used both bonuses, or when the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and any penalties are removed. A mythic Harrowing cast on the target of a non-mythic Harrowing supersedes and negates the Harrowing effect. If a creature is subjected to a second mythic Harrowing while a previous mythic Harrowing is still in effect, the new mythic Harrowing automatically fails. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power during the reading, you may discard one card of your choice and draw one new card in its place, replacing the effects of the chosen card with the effects of the newly drawn card. You must keep this new card. You can use each bonus twice, both at the doubled values. Once you have used both bonuses, or when the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and any penalties are removed.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Harrowing
Shield of the Dawnflower.MOD				DESC:Mythic: The disk of sunlight protects you as a buckler with a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels (maximum +5). You can make a melee touch attack with your Shield of the Dawnflower in place of a normal attack to deal its fire damage to a creature. Creatures taking damage from your shield catch on fire (Reflex negates); the save DC to extinguish the fire is equal to the DC of the spell.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Shield of the Dawnflower
Vermin Shape I.MOD							DESC:Mythic: The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0), and the resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases by 2. Choose one natural attack type the vermin form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4). Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round a number of times equal to your tier. For example, if you are 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of mythic Vermin Shape.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Vermin Shape I
Vermin Shape II.MOD							DESC:Mythic: The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0), and the resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases by 2. Choose one natural attack type the vermin form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4). Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round a number of times equal to your tier. For example, if you are 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of mythic Vermin Shape.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Vermin Shape II
Waters of Lamashtu.MOD						DESC:Mythic: When used as unholy water, mythic Waters of Lamashtu deal twice as much damage and prevent the creature from regaining hit points from fast healing or regeneration for 1d4 rounds (meaning the creature can be killed normally). The ability damage from the waters increases to 2d4, and a creature imbibing or anointed by the waters is nauseated for 1d4 rounds if it fails its saving throw. The long-term effects of drinking mythic Waters of Lamashtu happen more quickly, requiring only regular exposure over weeks instead of massive quantities for months, and warp the consuming creature more extensively (at the GM's discretion). Monstrosities created by mythic Waters of Lamashtu can breed with members of their original species and pass on such mutations to their offspring.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Waters of Lamashtu
