# Spell Name					Description
Borrowed Time.MOD			DESC:Mythic: If you expend one use of mythic power, instead of taking an extra swift action, you can take either an extra move or an extra swift action each round. You can use this extra swift action to take two immediate actions between your turns; this consumes your extra swift action in your next round. Each extra action you take still deals damage to you as described above.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Borrowed Time
Elemental Bombardment.MOD	DESC:Mythic: If you expend one use of mythic power, you can summon a combination of differently sized elementals of up to two different types, as long as their total number does not exceed the original limit. For example, you could summon one Huge air elemental and two Large fire elementals, or one Large water elemental and six Medium earth elementals. augmented (9th): If you expend three uses of mythic power, you summon twice as many elementals as normal, each with the advanced simple template.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Elemental Bombardment
Imbue with Flight.MOD		DESC:Mythic: If you expend one use of mythic power, you double the maximum weight of the object you can imbue with flight. You can expend additional uses of mythic power to increase the maximum size of the object you can imbue with flight. Imbuing a Huge object requires two uses of mythic power, imbuing a Gargantuan object requires four uses, and imbuing a Colossal object requires eight uses. These costs include the expenditure to cast a mythic spell, and count toward doubling the weight limit of the spell. Two or more casters can cast this spell in concert to share the mythic power cost. Each caster must expend an additional use of mythic power to cooperate; this does not count toward the other costs or effects of the spell. The group chooses which caster has control of the flight. As a full-round action, the controlling caster can cede control to another caster involved in the original casting of the spell.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Imbue with Flight
Soulreaver.MOD				DESC:Mythic: You can expend one use of mythic power to raise creatures killed by this effect as undead thralls. You can animate a number of Hit Dice worth of undead up to double your tier as if you had animated them with animate dead. The undead created by this spell count toward the total number of Hit Dice worth of undead you can control. augmented (8th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can raise slain foes as undead creatures chosen from the list of undead for create undead. By expending three uses of mythic power, you can select from the list for create greater undead. The total number of Hit Dice worth of undead created in this way can't exceed double your tier. Created undead are not automatically under your control. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creatures as they form.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Soulreaver

For the duration of this spell, you gain an extra swift action you can use only during your turn. You can't use this swift action to take a second immediate action between turns, but you can use it to take a swift action the turn after you've taken an immediate action. Each time you take an extra swift action in this fashion you take 1 point of Constitution damage. If you're immune to ability damage, you take 5 points of hit point damage instead. When the spell ends, you are staggered for 1d4+1 rounds from the temporal backlash.
Elemental Bombardment	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=7								SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Summoning		DESCRIPTOR:See text			COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 round					RANGE:Long			TARGETAREA:one or more summoned elementals				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL/2) rounds					SAVEINFO:none								SPELLRES:no						SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:You summon elementals from their elemental planes and hurl them onto your enemies with great force. You must have line of effect to a point at least 60 feet above your intended targets and within the spell's range. You can summon one greater elemental, two Huge elementals, four Large elementals, or eight Medium elementals. You aim the elementals at targets within 60 feet of each other, no more than one elemental per target. Each elemental can strike only a single target, regardless of its size. When an elemental strikes a target, it makes a single slam attack at its full attack bonus with a +4 circumstance bonus. The elemental deals damage according to the table below. The type and amount of damage dealt varies by the size and type of elemental (see the table). Some elementals inflict an additional special ability upon successfully hitting a target; these additional special abilities are detailed in the elemental's full stat block and are denoted with an asterisk (*). Whether or not it hits, the elemental takes bludgeoning damage according to its size. A summoned elemental acts on the same turn that it lands, starting prone in the nearest available space adjacent to its target. You must select one type of elemental to summon when casting this spell (see the sourcebook). When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type.

It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed. The targeted object flies as you direct it, using your Fly skill for any difficult maneuvers. You must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of the object to direct it, and moving it requires a move action. If not directed, the object hovers in place (no Fly check required). The maximum weight of the object and anything carried by it is 500 pounds per caster level (maximum 10,000 pounds).
