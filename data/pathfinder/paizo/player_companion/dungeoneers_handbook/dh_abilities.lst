# Ability Name							Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type					Multiple Requirements																											Description																																																																																																																	Template					Bonus to skill				Source Page
Alien Origins (Silver Mount)					KEY:Trait ~ Alien Origins		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Alien Origins],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait]			DESC:You are in some way tied to a mysterious alien monument, but you have forgotten an important piece of your past. Perhaps you were a metallurgist's experiment gone awry, a rediscovered automaton that escaped, or the result of some equally enigmatic phenomenon. Regardless, your unusual origins mark you as somehow different from others, and you know the gaps in your memory hold the key to your past.	DESC: You start play with a unique compass that doesn't point north and is riddled with indecipherable alien markings-the only object you have that you know to be tied to your home. In addition, your inscrutable mannerisms give you a +2 trait bonus on opposed Bluff checks.							BONUS:SKILL|Bluff|1|TYPE=Trait	SOURCEPAGE:p.IBC
Destined For Greatness (Absalom)				KEY:Trait ~ Destined For Greatness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Destined For Greatness],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait]	DESC:Ever since you were a child growing up in a vast city, you've been obsessed with acquiring true divinity. Though it remains to be seen whether you will ever achieve your long-standing dream, your fascination with other would-be deities has granted you no small measure of savvy when it comes to preparing to explore dungeons.	DESC: You start with a kit worth no more than 300 gp, and the expendable contents of the kit are automatically restored to their original capacity at no cost to you whenever you enter a settlement with a population of at least 2,500.

Dungeon Dweller (Any Subterranean Dungeon)		KEY:Trait ~ Dungeon Dweller		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RegionalTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Dungeon Dweller],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RegionalTrait]		DESC:Not only are you competent while deep underground, you thrive in these perilous environs. Whether you were born in the labyrinthine tunnels or your mysterious parental figures brought you up in sand-ridden corridors of some forgotten pyramid, your emergence is somehow tied to one of the world's infamous subterranean dungeons.	DESC: You start with one additional language chosen from the following list: Aklo, Dark Folk, Draconic, Goblin, Necril, Orc, or Undercommon. In addition, whenever you must attempt a Survival check to avoid getting lost in a dungeon, you may roll the check twice and take the better result.

One such intrepid role model in particular was of great import to you.	DESC: On the last day you ever saw your hero, the adventurer gave you a unique dungeon guide worth no more than 750 gp and with an accuracy modifier of no greater than +2.
