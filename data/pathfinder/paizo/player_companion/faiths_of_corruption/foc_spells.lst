###Block: Full Spell Descriptions
# Spell Name			Description
Shared Sacrifice.MOD		DESC:With this spell, you create a link between yourself and your target, and you can direct pain and damage through this link. You only take half damage from wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by the target of this spell. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, cannot be shared through this link. If you suffer a reduction in hit points because of a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target of this spell because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned back to you. If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Monstrous Extremities.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you can change one of the extremities of the creature touched - arms or legs only - into another shape of approximately the same size and mass. You can choose from a tentacle, a hoof, or a wing. The subject must take approximately 10 minutes to familiarize itself with the function and movement of the new extremity. These new forms do not allow the subject to fly, run faster, or swim better however, they do act as natural weapons of the appropriate type, and the subject can use them to make secondary attacks while making attacks with weapons as a full-attack action. The secondary attacks are made using the creature's base attack bonus -5 and adding only 1/2 the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls. The subject cannot hold a weapon or use any item that would ordinarily fit into the slot of the changed extremity. The subject can receive the benefits of this spell multiple times.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lose the Trail.MOD		DESC:This spell allows the caster to obscure her tracks when fleeing from a pursuer. This increases the DC of any Survival checks made to track the spell's subjects by +(CASTERLEVEL*2).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Night of Blades.MOD		DESC:Useful primarily to those who skulk in the darkness, this spell is a temporary trap for the unwary. It summons an immobile wall of tiny black blades that whirl and tear into creatures like a cyclone. Anyone who enters this space takes (min(CASTERLEVEL,10))d4 points of damage, with a Reflex save for half damage. The spell cannot be cast so that it appears in a space already occupied by Small or larger creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Brittle Portal.MOD		DESC:This spell weakens the bonds of existence, and reduces the hardness of any nonmagical surface within its area of effect by (CASTERLEVEL*2). The spell is centered on a flat surface chosen by the caster, and the hardness reduction effect persists for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vampiric Hunger.MOD		DESC:The target of this spell grows the fangs of a vampire, as well as a thirst for blood. For the duration of this spell, the target gains the ability to drain an opponent's blood during a grapple if the target establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Each round it drains blood in this way, the target heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for the duration of the spell (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points). If the target does not drain blood in this way while under the effects of this spell, it becomes exhausted at the end of the spell's duration.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Touch of Bloodletting.MOD	DESC:This spell causes any existing wounds that the target possesses to bleed profusely. If the creature's current total hit points are less than its maximum, this spell causes the creature to take 1 point of bleed damage each round and become exhausted for the duration of the spell. A successful DC 15 Heal check or any spell that cures hit point damage negates the effects of this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
