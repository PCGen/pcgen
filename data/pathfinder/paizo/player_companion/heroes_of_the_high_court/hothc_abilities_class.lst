Royal Alchemist				KEY:Alchemist Archetype ~ Royal Alchemist				CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.AlchemistArchetype																									DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:Paranoia runs rampant among the noble courts of the Inner Sea. On account of this distrust, many rulers often hire specialized alchemists capable of concocting protections from both poisons and diseases for the nobles and their guests. The royal alchemist tradition began in the nation of Rahadoum shortly after the Oath Wars as a replacement for the protection once offered by the clerics and priests of the region. Today, royal alchemists are found in the courts of Cheliax, Galt, Taldor, and, surprisingly, Geb, where living visitors to the Blood Lords are offered protection from the death around them.

The royal alchemist creates his alchemical antidotes when he prepares his extracts for the day; they remain potent for 1 day before losing their properties, and the cost of the materials used to make them is insignificant. An alchemical antidote does not qualify as an extract or an infusion for the purpose of feats or discoveries. The royal alchemist has a pool of %1 points that he can divide among any number of alchemical antidotes, though the maximum number of points he can spend on a single antidote is %2. Each point grants the imbiber of the alchemical antidote a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against poison for %3 hours. The royal alchemist can also create an antidote that protects against diseases. For every 2 points the royal alchemist spends from his pool, the imbiber of the alchemical antidote gains a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against disease for 24 hours. The royal alchemist can expend 10 points from his pool to provide immunity to diseases or poisons (decided by him at the time of the antidote’s creation); this immunity lasts for %3 minutes after the antidote is imbibed. An alchemical remedy can protect against either diseases or poisons, but not both.|RoyalAlchemistAntidote|AlchemistLVL/2|max(1,INT)	DESC:The royal alchemist can alter the distribution of the bonuses of any unused alchemical antidotes as a full-round action, either combining them or splitting the bonuses further.

He must decide that an extract is an aromatic extract when he makes it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within a 10-foot spread of the extract. The aromatic extract is treated as having the minimum caster level required for the original extract. An aromatic extract expends one of the alchemist’s daily extracts as if it were an extract 2 levels higher. This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch.

A nostrum can contain only an ingested poison, and the save DC of the poison is reduced by 2. The poison takes effect %1 hours after being imbibed decided by the alchemist at the creation of the nostrum. The poison within a nostrum can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and similar abilities.

Remote Bomb					KEY:Discovery ~ Remote Bomb						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier																				SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The alchemist can spend two uses of his daily bombs to create a special bomb that is manually detonated. When the bomb is created, the alchemist also creates a catalyst distillate, which requires no extra time or cost. A remote bomb is inert unless triggered by this distillate. The bomb is detonated as a standard action when the distillate fumes are exposed to the rest of the bomb. An alchemist must be within 60 feet of the bomb for the distillate to successfully trigger the bomb. A catalyst distillate can detonate a bomb even if the bomb has already been hurled at a target. Triggering the distillate outside of the 60-foot range or after 1 hour has no effect.

Court Fool					KEY:Bard Archetype ~ Court Fool					CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.BardArchetype																													SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:Arguably the oldest and most widespread role for a court entertainer is that of the court jester or fool. This role arose from the need to offset the intense, even deadly, seriousness of court business. The court fool serves as an outlet for the constant pressure of aristocratic dealings, relieving tensions through humor. The motley clad acrobat is a good example of this style of court fool, using physical comedy to generate belly laughs and raise spirits. In other courts, the court fool might ridicule social conventions with bawdy songs or engage in biting satire, parodying manners or even mocking individuals to spread good cheer. The court fool holds up an unflattering mirror to those in charge or speaks truths, however veiled, that no one else can safely utter.

Each round, he attempts an Acrobatics check. Any ally (including the court fool) within 30 feet can use this check in place of her own saving throw against confusion and fascination effects. Those already under a confusion or fascination effect can attempt a new save each round using the court fool’s Acrobatics check. A court fool wearing an entertainer’s outfit gains a +2 bonus on these Acrobatics checks. Distracting motley doesn’t work on effects that don’t allow saves.
