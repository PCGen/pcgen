Anthem of Pageantry		KEY:Masterpiece ~ Anthem of Pageantry		OUTPUTNAME:The Anthem of Pageantry	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	SOURCEPAGE:7	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:This lengthy piece gradually increases in power and gravity, conjuring magnificent furnishings and outfits out of thin air.	DESC:[Effect] This piece, developed from ancient Azlanti musical records about the just rewards of honest striving, consists of a series of complicated crescendos, each culminating in a stirring, lengthy refrain. When you complete the performance, a single room or chamber you occupy appears to be swathed in silks and opulent furnishings you envision. You and up to one ally per bard level within the room who can hear you are clothed in illusory exotic fabrics, furs, and jewels while in the room. If you or an affected ally leave the room before the effect’s duration expires, the illusion ends. A creature can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. [Use] 1 bardic performance round per 10 minutes of the effect’s duration. [Action] 1 minute.

DESC:[Effect] This lilting tune is soothing and repetitive. When you activate the performance, choose one creature per bard level within close range. Any targeted creature must succeed at a Will save or take a –2 penalty on saving throws against enchantment effects and on Sense Motive checks. This effect lasts for as long as you maintain the performance. Although this performance does have words, it is not a language-dependent effect. [Use] 1 bardic performance round per round.

DESC:[Effect] You begin an epic tale of kings and queens in ages past, recounting their lineages and sage deeds. The epic has no fixed form and has substantial room for improvisation; many bards include tales of their own wise ancestors, or the ancestors of noteworthy members of their audience. When you activate the performance, one target creature other than you within close range (%1 feet) gains the benefit of a commune spell. You must continue the performance for the target to receive answers, as your retelling is magically guided to include relevant responses. If you cease the performance before the target has asked all of its questions, or if you run out of bardic performance rounds, any remaining questions are lost. [Use] 10 bardic performance rounds, plus 1 bardic performance round per question. [Action] 10 minutes.|25+(5*BardLVL/2)
