Invested Regent				KEY:Unchained Monk Archetype ~ Invested Regent				CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.Unchained Monk Archetype																										DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	DESC:The invested regent has been handpicked by inscrutable divine forces to command others—either at the present or at some future time. The invested regent can harness a divine spark to perform superhuman stunts, influence others, and escape injury. Invested regents come from all races and walks of life, but they are more likely to be nobleborn in their cultures. Although some invested regents are acutely aware of their powers’ divine origins (such as powers gained from an investment ceremony to Asmodeus in the nation of Cheliax), others do not know the source of their abilities. Invested regents have strong personalities and a destiny to rule.
