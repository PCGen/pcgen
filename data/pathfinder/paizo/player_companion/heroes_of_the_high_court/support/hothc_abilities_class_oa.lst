Silksworn					KEY:Occultist Archetype ~ Silksworn					CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.OccultistArchetype																									DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:Occultists who recognize that flashy garb and fashionable accoutrements can be just as powerful as psychically charged relics in the right situations are known as silksworn. They draw their power from wearing luxurious garments and can be found in many noble courts throughout Golarion, though they often keep their abilities secret. Silksworn are even found among the mystics and the magical practitioners of Nex, each seeking the patronage of one or more of the Arclords.

Class Skills				KEY:Silksworn ~ Class Skills						CATEGORY:Internal			TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures																												CSKILL:Appraise|Bluff|TYPE=Craft|Diplomacy|Disable Device|Disguise|Fly|Knowledge (arcana)|Knowledge (history)|Knowledge (nobility)|Knowledge (religion)|Linguistics|Perception|TYPE=Profession|Sense Motive|Sleight of Hand|Spellcraft|Use Magic Device
Spells					KEY:Silksworn ~ Spells							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:A silksworn’s spells are considered arcane spells, not psychic spells, and his spells use verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components. This alters the occultist’s spells.
Implements					KEY:Silksworn ~ Implements						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:When a silksworn chooses an implement school, he does not choose a specific object. Instead, a silksworn must be wearing an ostentatious garment or magic item worth 10 gp or more of the appropriate type and in the appropriate slot: abjuration (wrists), conjuration (shoulders), divination (eyes), enchantment (neck), evocation (hands), illusion (head), necromancy (chest), and transmutation (feet). A silksworn who does not meet this requirement is treated as lacking the appropriate implement for the purpose of his class features, including spellcasting. This alters the occultist’s implements.
Cantrips					KEY:Silksworn ~ Cantrips						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:Each time he selects an implement school, a silksworn gains one cantrip, or 0-level arcane spell (including when he selects a school that he has already learned to use). These cantrips otherwise behave as an occultist’s knacks. This ability replaces knacks.
Mental Focus				KEY:Silksworn ~ Mental Focus						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:The silksworn’s available mental focus is equal to his occultist level + his Intelligence modifier + his Charisma modifier. This ability alters mental focus.			BONUS:VAR|OccultistMentalFocus|CHA-if(OccultistMentalFocusFCB>=2,OccultistMentalFocusFCB/2,0)
Devoted Mystic				KEY:Silksworn ~ Devoted Mystic					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:A silksworn is proficient with only simple weapons and isn’t proficient with any armor or shields. At 1st level, the silksworn gains access to four implement schools instead of two. At 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the silksworn gains access to an additional implement school, to a maximum of nine schools at 18th level. At 8th, 12th, and 16th levels, the silksworn increases the number of spells of each level he can cast each day by one. This does not allow the silksworn to cast spells of a level he does not yet have access to. This ability alters implements and the occultist’s weapon and armor proficiencies.

Silksworn Eloquence			KEY:Silksworn ~ Silksworn Eloquence					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:A silksworn gains a +1 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for each magical article of clothing occupying one of his implement schools’ magic item slots.
Silksworn Deception			KEY:Silksworn ~ Silksworn Deception					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:A silksworn can hide his speech and gestures within his extravagant clothing. Whenever the silksworn casts a spell, he can attempt a Bluff check opposed by Sense Motive checks from those observing him. Those who fail are unaware of his spellcasting, unless an effect obviously originates from the silksworn.
Silksworn Arcana				KEY:Silksworn ~ Silksworn Arcana					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:When a silksworn casts a spell while wearing a magic article of clothing in the appropriate school’s magic item slot, the spell’s saving throw DC increases by 2.
Implement Mastery				KEY:Silksworn ~ Implement Mastery					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SilkswornClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:A silksworn chooses two implement schools instead of one, and implement mastery’s effects apply to both. The silksworn gains 4 additional points of mental focus for each school’s implement. This alters the occultist’s implement mastery.
