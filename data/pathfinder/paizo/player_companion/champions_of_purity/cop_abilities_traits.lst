Blessed Touch		KEY:Trait ~ Blessed Touch					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Blessed Touch],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]		DESC:You may have been raised in a devout family, studied the divine in a formal church environment, or even learned how to combine traditional healing techniques with those of divine casters. In so doing, you have focused yourself into being the perfect vessel for your deity. Divine power flows through you like a mountain stream, making your healing touch more potent than that of others. You heal 1 additional point of damage when using lay on hands, channeling energy, or casting a cure spell.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Hard to Kill		KEY:Trait ~ Hard to Kill					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CombatTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~Hard to Kill],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CombatTrait]		DESC:Your strong will to live and spread good combined with your pure physicality makes you a tough opponent to take down. You may have discovered this as a child after a tragic accident or during the course of your first battle. When you are attempting a Constitution check to stabilize when dying, the penalty on the check is only half your negative hit point total instead of your full negative hit point total.																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Weapon of Peace		KEY:Trait ~ Weapon of Peace					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CombatTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~Weapon of Peace],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CombatTrait]		DESC:Even though you are a trained combatant, proficient with any number of weapons, you don't relish killing your enemies. It's not that you're afraid of seeing blood, but rather that disabling a foe is superior to killing someone capable of admitting defeat. When using a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to instead deal nonlethal damage, you take only a -2 penalty instead of -4.																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Helpful			KEY:Trait ~ Helpful						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CombatTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Helpful],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CombatTrait]			DESC:You always know the best way to assist your companions, be it assisting them with a task, defending them in battle, or helping them place a well aimed strike. When using the aid another action, you grant your ally a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus.																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Mediator			KEY:Trait ~ Mediator						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.SocialTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Mediator],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SocialTrait]			DESC:You have a way with calming tempers, using cool logic to sooth heated disagreements, and you were always the one to settle arguments among your friends, family, and community. You receive a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks. In addition, you receive a +1 trait bonus to the DC of any charm or compulsion effect that does not provide ongoing control and results in peaceful acts, such as calm emotions, sleep, or a Suggestion to lay down arms.

Redeemer			KEY:Trait ~ Redeemer						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Redeemer],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]			DESC:You've always held the strong belief that morality is everyone's choice, and that those who act in wicked ways have simply never been shown how their actions truly affect others. If they could be shown their errors, then they would accept a more positive course of action-and you have just enough patience to see this through. When acting as a sponsor for an evil creature seeking redemption (see page 18), your patience and kindness grant the creature a +3 bonus on its save rather than a +1 bonus.
