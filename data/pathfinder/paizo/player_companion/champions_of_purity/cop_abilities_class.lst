###Block: CELESTIAL RAGE POWERS - While others rage in brutality or for the sheer love of violence, good barbarians’ fury is fuelled by a sense of justice and righteousness for which they live and die.
Celestial Totem			KEY:Rage Power ~ Celestial Totem			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BarbarianClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialQuality	DESC:While raging, the barbarian shines with a righteous light.

# Recovery

###Block: Alchemist - Discoveries
# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type														Var. Min. Value			Description																																																																																																										Source Page
Celestial Poisons			KEY:Discovery ~ Celestial Poisons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:The alchemist is able to infuse poisons with celestial power so they can affect evil creatures that are normally immune to poison. Any poison the alchemist administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its save, the poison acts as normal, but may have no effect on the creature, depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing Constitution damage to undead). An alchemist must be at least 8 th level before selecting this discovery.													SOURCEPAGE:p.
Change Alignment			KEY:Discovery ~ Change Alignment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiber's alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for 10 minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.	SOURCEPAGE:p.
Holy Bombs*				KEY:Discovery ~ Holy Bombs				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality.AlchemistBombModifier	PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,8	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good divine damage. Evil creatures that take a direct hit from a holy bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, holy bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Holy bombs have no effect on good-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.
Ranged Baptism			KEY:Discovery ~ Ranged Baptism			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:When the alchemist uses holy water as a splash weapon, any squares subject to its effects (including creatures affected by splash damage) or that contain creatures subject to its effects are also affected as if by consecrate, for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Undead struck by holy water remain affected by the consecrate effect even if they leave the affected area. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery																											SOURCEPAGE:p.

# GRAND DISCOVERY
Change Alignment, Greater	KEY:Discovery ~ Change Alignment (Greater)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistGrandDiscovery.Supernatural						DESC:The effects of the alchemist's change alignment infusion become permanent and can only be reversed by a wish or miracle. A permanent, forced change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best. An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.

###Block: Rogue Talents
# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type													Required AL		Description
Sacred Sneak Attack	KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Sacred Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.RogueTalent.AttackOption	PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG	DESC:When making a sneak attack against an undead creature or evil outsider, the rogue's sneak attack damage is considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Normal weapon damage is unaffected for this attack. A rogue must have a good alignment to select this rogue talent.
Sacrifice Self		KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Sacrifice Self		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.RogueTalent						DESC:A rogue who makes a successful Reflex save against an area effect can ignore the benefits of her evasion ability to shield an adjacent ally against the effect, essentially halving the damage that ally would normally take. A rogue with improved evasion can attempt a secondary save against her ally's damage. If the save is successful, neither she nor her ally takes any damage. A rogue must have evasion in order to select this talent, and she must have improved evasion to benefit from the secondary effect.
Stem the Flow		KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Stem the Flow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.RogueTalent						DESC:When making a successful sneak attack against a creature with the ability to channel energy, the rogue may forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage to instead prevent the target from channeling energy for a number of rounds equal to half her rogue level.
