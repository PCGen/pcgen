Celestial Poisons	KEY:Discovery ~ Celestial Poisons		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The alchemist is able to infuse poisons with celestial power so they can affect evil creatures that are normally immune to poison. Any poison the alchemist administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply.

An alchemist must be at least 8 th level before selecting this discovery.
Change Alignment	KEY:Discovery ~ Change Alignment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiber's alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for i o minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use. An alchemist mu st be at least 12 th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.
Holy Bombs*		KEY:Discovery ~ Holy Bombs			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good divine damage.

DESC:The effects of the alchemist's change alignment infusion become permanent and can only be reversed by a wish or miracle. A permanent, forced change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best. An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.

###Block: Rogue Talents
Sacred Sneak Attack	KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Sacred Sneak Attack		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.RogueTalent.AttackOption	DESC:When making a sneak attack against an undead creature or evil outsider, the rogue's sneak attack damage is considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
