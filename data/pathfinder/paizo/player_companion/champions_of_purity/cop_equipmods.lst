When a successful hit from a compassionate weapon would bring a creature to -1 or fewer hit points, that creature is automatically stabilized. This ability can be suppressed at will as a free action.
Redeemed		PLUS:3	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	TYPE:Weapon	PRETYPE:2,Weapon,Enhancement	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SPROP:A redeemed weapon was once a corrupt unholy weapon. The taint of evil has been purged from it, however, and the weapon is now in all ways a holy weapon, dealing an additional 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. In addition, the wielder gains a sacred bonus on saving throws equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus against the spells and abilities of evil outsiders and a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks to identify evil outsiders and their special powers or vulnerabilities. When there deemed weapon special ability is added to an unholy weapon,the weapon loses the unholy property and gains the redeemed property, and the crafter must pay the price of adding a +1 enhancement bonus to the weapon.
