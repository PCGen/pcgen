# New Feats
# ==============================

Betraying Blow						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Solo Maneuvers		 PRETOTALAB:8																								PRETEXT:Solo Maneuvers, base attack bonus +8.										DESC:When you break an alliance, you make sure it's broken for good.								SOURCEPAGE:p.23		BENEFIT:Whenever you use a melee attack to deal nonlethal damage to a creature that only you threaten, roll an opposed Bluff check. You deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1/2 the difference between your Bluff check and your opponent's Sense Motive check (minimum 0). If your opponent has an attitude of friendly or helpful toward you (even temporarily), you instead deal an amount equal to the difference between your checks. Regardless, the amount of extra nonlethal damage cannot exceed your Hit Dice.
Dirty Trick Master					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Greater Dirty Trick,Improved Dirty Trick		 PRETOTALAB:11																		PRETEXT:Greater Dirty Trick, Improved Dirty Trick, base attack bonus +11.			DESC:You are adept at stifling your enemies and can expertly make a bad situation even worse. 		SOURCEPAGE:p.25		BENEFIT:When you successfully perform a dirty trick maneuver against an opponent still affected by a previous dirty trick (your own or another's), you can cause the condition to worsen.
Divert Harm							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Improved Evasion		PRETOTALAB:6	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise		PRESTAT:1,INT=13			PRETEXT:Int 13, Combat Expertise, base attack bonus +6, evasion class feature.		DESC:You know how to throw your enemies into harm's way at the last second.							SOURCEPAGE:p.25		BENEFIT:When you are the target of an area-of-effect attack that normally deals half damage on a successful Reflex save, you may, as an immediate action, wrestle an adjacent foe into harm's way. This does not alter the position of you or your opponent, but your opponent must attempt a Reflex save against the attack in your place. If they fail, they takes half damage from the attack and you take none; if it succeeds, it takes no damage and you take damage as though you'd failed your saving throw (abilities such as improved evasion still apply). This feat works even if the opponent was already in the affected area (it's possible an unlucky opponent could take 1-1/2 times the damage normally possible). You can use this ability only on a foe within one size category of yourself.
