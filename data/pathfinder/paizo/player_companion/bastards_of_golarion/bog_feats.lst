# Ability Name				Category of Ability	Type			Required Ability																Multiple Requirements									Required Race						Required Skill			Required Text												PRETOTALAB		Var. Min. Value			Description															Source Page		Benefits
Betraying Blow				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Solo Maneuvers																																					PRETEXT:Solo Maneuvers, base attack bonus +8.							PRETOTALAB:8						DESC:When you break an alliance, you make sure it's broken for good.					SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Whenever you use a melee attack to deal nonlethal damage to a creature that only you threaten, roll an opposed Bluff check. You deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1/2 the difference between your Bluff check and your opponent's Sense Motive check (minimum 0). If your opponent has an attitude of friendly or helpful toward you (even temporarily), you instead deal an amount equal to the difference between your checks. Regardless, the amount of extra nonlethal damage cannot exceed your Hit Dice.
Dirty Trick Master			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Greater Dirty Trick,Improved Dirty Trick																																PRETEXT:Greater Dirty Trick, Improved Dirty Trick, base attack bonus +11.		PRETOTALAB:11						DESC:You are adept at stifling your enemies and can expertly make a bad situation even worse.	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When you successfully perform a dirty trick maneuver against an opponent still affected by a previous dirty trick (your own or another's), you can cause the condition to worsen.
Divert Harm					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Improved Evasion	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise	PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,INT=13],[PREVARGTEQ:CombatFeatIntRequirement,13]														PRETEXT:Int 13, Combat Expertise, base attack bonus +6, evasion class feature.	PRETOTALAB:6						DESC:You know how to throw your enemies into harm's way at the last second.				SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When you are the target of an area-of-effect attack that normally deals half damage on a successful Reflex save, you may, as an immediate action, wrestle an adjacent foe into harm's way. This does not alter the position of you or your opponent, but your opponent must attempt a Reflex save against the attack in your place. If they fail, they takes half damage from the attack and you take none; if it succeeds, it takes no damage and you take damage as though you'd failed your saving throw (abilities such as improved evasion still apply). This feat works even if the opponent was already in the affected area (it's possible an unlucky opponent could take 1-1/2 times the damage normally possible). You can use this ability only on a foe within one size category of yourself.
