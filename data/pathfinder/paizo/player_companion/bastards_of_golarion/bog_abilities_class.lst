Inspire Teamwork			KEY:Averaka Arbiter ~ Inspire Teamwork					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.BardInspireCompetence																																															DESCISPI:YES	DESC:An Averaka arbiter can use his performance to treat his allies as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the bard for the purpose of determining whether the bard receives a bonus from his teamwork feats. His allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves.

To be affected, a creature must be within 30 feet and able to hear the bard. Creatures whose attitude toward the bard becomes indifferent or better immediately cease attacking the bard and his allies, but may otherwise act as they please. The effect persists for as long as the creature is within 30 feet and the bard continues his performance. The effect ends if one of the bard's allies attacks the creature.

More than a few who study at Erages Academy follow this path because of the promises of wealth that the city's criminal element makes toward practiced brawlers and smugglers.

Dark Shifter			KEY:Dark Shifter ~ Magus							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MagusArcana											PRECLASS:1,Magus=6																																											DESC:You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a move action to change the target of an ongoing spell effect with the darkness descriptor within 60 feet. The new target must be within the spell's range, using your level as the effective caster level for the purpose of determining the maximum range the effect can be moved from you. If the spell effect you are moving originated from another creature, you must succeed at a caster level check to reposition the effect (DC = 11 + the effect's caster level). Failure wastes your move action, but does not expend the point from your arcane pool.																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.9

Masterpiece (The Canticle of Joy)	KEY:Masterpiece ~ The Canticle of Joy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece			SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:This agonizing eulogy gets into a listener's blood, and bestows on him the phantom sensation of all the agonies suffered by Zon-Kuthon's most pious worshipers. One target within range is cursed as though affected by bestow curse as long as the bard maintains the performance. Although this lullaby does have words, it is not a language-dependent effect. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round. Action: 1 round.
