DESC:Born of mortal and fiendish blood intertwined, tieflings are tainted individuals thrust into a world that has learned to both fear and despise them. Whether they openly display their freakish ancestry in settlements known for their tiefling populations or hide such shameful attributes through either mundane or magical methods, all tieflings know that they are different. Blood of Fiends presents a player-friendly overview of the tieflings of the Player Companion, as well as new rules and information to help players customize their own fiendish characters.
