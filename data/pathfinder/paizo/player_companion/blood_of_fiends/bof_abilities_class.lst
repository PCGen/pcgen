Dance of Kindled Desires	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Dance of Kindled Desires	OUTPUTNAME:The Dance of Kindled Desires	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:DanceOfKindledDesiresDC|0							DESC:Your dance entices one creature within 30 feet that is able to see you, invoking every imaginable vice and craving until finally the desire the creature personally finds most appealing overwhelms its thoughts. You always know what your target wants, and, if you have the means to provide it, can offer it to the creature in exchange for a specific service. The creature can resist this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC %1), and creatures never agree if you offer services that are physically impossible or obviously suicidal, or if you lie about having the means to fulfill the desire in question. The service can never take more than a day to complete, and the affected creature gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw if the service requires more than an hour to complete. Use: 3 bardic performance rounds. Action: 3 full rounds.|DanceOfKindledDesiresDC	BONUS:VAR|DanceOfKindledDesiresDC|10+(MasterpieceLVL/2)+CHA								SOURCEPAGE:p.28

When you complete this performance, all creatures within 30 feet who can hear your performance must make a successful Will saving throw (DC %1) or take 1d6 points of energy damage. The energy type can be either acid, cold, or fire (your choice, chosen when you begin performing the masterpiece). Affected creatures that fail their saving throws take damage on the round you begin the performance and each round you continue the performance as long as they remain in range. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance affect this masterpiece. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round. Action: 1 standard action.|MelodyOfFrightfulDeathDC						BONUS:VAR|MelodyOfFrightfulDeathDC|10+(MasterpieceLVL/2)+CHA								SOURCEPAGE:p.28

If the target fails its Will save (DC %1), whenever it attempts any action other than moving up to its base speed or making a single melee attack (but not both) in a single round, it must succeed at a concentration check (DC %2) to avoid wasting its action because of a fit of coughing and sneezing. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.

Fear the Flames		KEY:Damnation Domain ~ Fear the Flames	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:You can give a creature you can see within 60 feet one chance to avoid an eternity of suffering by ordering it to carry out any one simple action that would take no more than 1 round to complete. Good and neutral creatures that refuse become shaken for 1 round (Will negates), while evil creatures that obey gain a +2 morale bonus on all rolls and checks made for 1 round.

# Possession Inquisition
Self-Control		KEY:Possession Domain ~ Self-Control	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You possess remarkable control over your own body, and gain a +2 competence bonus on saving throws made against enchantment spells of the charm or compulsion subschool.

While you are possessing an animal in this way, your own body becomes helpless and unaware. You can travel any distance from your body so long as you remain on the same plane, and can return to your own body as a free action at any time. If the animal or your body takes damage, or you attempt to make the animal attack or do anything out of character, the effect immediately ends and you return to your own body.|DomainPossessionLVL				SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Body Snatch			KEY:Possession Domain ~ Body Snatch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike		DESC:Once per day as an immediate action upon falling unconscious because of dropping below 0 hit points, you can cast your soul from your body and attempt to occupy the body of another creature within 30 feet. This ability otherwise functions identically to Magic Jar except that your actual body serves as the receptacle and you suppress the consciousness of your target rather than casting it out. Your body continues to bleed as normal unless it is somehow stabilized, and if its hit points drop to a negative number equal to your Constitution score, the magic jar effect prematurely ends and you die as normal.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
# Sin Inquisition
Sin Sense			KEY:Sin Domain ~ Sin Sense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a full-round action, you can determine which sin most strongly influences a target by quickly reading its mind. Once you learn this fact, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Charisma-based skill check made against the target as long as it somehow incorporates a temptation that relates to that sin. You can use this ability %1 times per day. This is a mind-affecting effect.|DomainSinTimes																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|DomainSinTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day
Indulge			KEY:Sin Domain ~ Indulge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, you can awaken a creature's vice and overwhelm its senses with urgency. You must decide to use this ability before using your sin sense ability on a creature, and the target receives a Will save to negate the effect. If the creature fails its saving throw, for the next 24 hours, whenever the affected creature is given an opportunity to indulge in its favored sin, that creature must yield to the impulse or make a second Will saving throw to avoid becoming sickened for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting effect.											SOURCEPAGE:p.27
