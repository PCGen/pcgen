# Absalom
Desert Veil																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Head																													COST:11000	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.4		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|moderate abjuration					QUALITY:Caster Level|7th		QUALITY:Slot|head				QUALITY:Construction Cost|5,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, endure elements, grove of respite																																																																																																																																																												DESCISPI:YES				DESC:Small round mirrors adorn the edges of this yellow, Qadiran silk veil, which covers the wearer's mouth and nose. The veil protects the wearer against extreme temperatures, as per endure elements. In addition, once per day while in a warm or temperate desert, the wearer can speak a command word to create a 20-foot-radius oasis that functions like a casting of grove of respite. The oasis appears in a spot the wearer designates within 40 feet and disappears after 8 hours. Any creature outside the oasis that sees it must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or dismiss it as a mirage to be ignored. A creature that steps inside the oasis, however, recognizes its substance.
Mother-Sphinx Token																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:9000	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.5		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|moderate evocation						QUALITY:Caster Level|7th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|4,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, arcane concordance																																																																																																																																																																DESCISPI:YES				DESC:This wooden disk bears the image of a mother-sphinx, a symbol of Absalom that epitomizes knowledge and arcane power, brought by Osirian families in the city's early years. Once per day, the user can designate an enemy within 100 feet and speak a command word. When she does, any spells she casts in the next 2 rounds that target the designated enemy are affected as if she were under the effects of an arcane concordance spell.
Whisper Safe																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:8000	WT:.5															SOURCEPAGE:p.5																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint conjuration						QUALITY:Caster Level|4th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|4,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, rumormonger																																																																																																																																																																		DESCISPI:YES				DESC:A mirrored mask emblem adorns this black-lacquered jewelry box. When a user speaks a fact into the open box and closes it (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunities), the whisper safe attunes to him. While holding the attuned box, he can spend an immediate action at will to learn how many people know the fact. Furthermore, he can concentrate on the box for 1 minute as if he were concentrating on a spell to learn the general details of each of those people, including alignment, gender, race, character class, and the name by which each person is most commonly known. However, if a person has taken any effort to obscure any of these details from the public eye, the box omits that individual detail or details. Similarly, the box reveals no details about a person who knows the fact and is a Vigilante or otherwise has dual identity or a similar class feature. Opening an attuned whisper safe releases the fact in an audible whisper, after which the box can be used to store another fact as described.

# Anuli
Mazludeh's Shield Token				NAMEISPI:YES																		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:22000	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.7		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|moderate enchantment					QUALITY:Caster Level|9th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|11,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, battlemind link, bless																																																																																																																																																															DESCISPI:YES				DESC:This small bronze token is shaped like a heavy shield. Emblazoned clearly on the token is an image of a snake eating its own tail encircling seven eggs - the holy symbol of Mazludeh, the Mother of Hearth and Wall. Once per day, the wielder of this item can touch the token as a standard action. When she does so, she chooses an ally within 30 feet whom she can see. The wielder and her ally then both gain either a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls or a +2 deflection bonus to AC for the next 10 rounds (chosen when the wielder touches the token; once a benefit is chosen, it can't be changed during the effect's duration). The wielder can dismiss this benefit early as a free action, but the item's use is still expended as normal.
Rebuilder's Boots																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Feet.Boot																												COST:14500	WT:2	SLOTS:2													SOURCEPAGE:p.7																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|4th		QUALITY:Slot|feet				QUALITY:Construction Cost|7,250 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, crafter's fortune, feather step																																																																																																																																																													DESCISPI:YES				DESC:Long ago, engineers in Anuli wore pairs of these sturdy brown leather boots to navigate the city after the Paroxsys tore apart the land. The wearer of these boots gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft checks to repair items. Additionally, as a move action, the wearer of a pair of rebuilder's boots can activate them to move up to her land speed and ignore any adverse movement effects of difficult terrain, as per the effects of the feather step spell. This effect lasts for 40 minutes per day or until the wearer ends it as a free action. The wearer need not spend this duration all at once, but she must spend it in 1-minute increments.

# Caliphas
Protective Ruff																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Neck																													COST:1000	WT:.5															SOURCEPAGE:p.8																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|neck				QUALITY:Construction Cost|500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, mending																																																																																																																																																																										DESC:This lace collar fits snugly around the wearer's neck. When an effect would damage an item worn in any of the wearer's item slots, up to 10 points of damage are redirected to the ruff. (Damaging effects that do not involve hit points, such as rusting grasp, are not affected.) A protective ruff has 10 hit points and hardness 5. When the ruff is reduced to 0 hit points, it stops functioning; if reduced to less than 0 hit points, it is destroyed as normal. While worn, a protective ruff with 1 or more hit points regenerates at the rate of 1 hit point per hour.
Roseskin Comb																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Head																													COST:37000	WT:.5															SOURCEPAGE:p.8		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 3|CHARGES[3]																																																																																BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=NaturalArmorEnhancement																																																																																																																																																																																																																					QUALITY:Aura|moderate transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|7th		QUALITY:Slot|head				QUALITY:Construction Cost|18,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, barkskin, thorn body																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:A green copper comb holds this pink-hued alabaster headpiece in its wearer's hair, subtly infusing her skin with strength. In addition to providing an air of loveliness to its wearer, a roseskin comb grants a +2 enhancement bonus to its wearer's natural armor. In addition, three times per day as a standard action, the wearer of a roseskin comb can command barbs to protrude from her skin, as per thornbody, for 7 rounds. 
Wine of Concordance																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																												COST:1200	WT:2															SOURCEPAGE:p.8																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint abjuration and divination		QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|600 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, shield other, creator must have at least 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy)																																																																																																																																																				DESCISPI:YES				DESC:This sweet white wine contains notes of apple, lemon, and peach and is among the most citrus-flavored of the local wines produced in Caliphas. According to traditional legends, drinking glasses of wine of concordance together can forge strong bonds between those individuals who share it, both emotionally and magically. Drinking a glass of wine of concordance takes at least 1 round, though many imbibers take longer to savor the wine's fruity flavor. Creatures that each finish at least one glass of the wine while within 10 feet of each other become aware of each other, as per status (each drinker is aware of the direction and distance to each other and any conditions affecting the others). In addition, while they're within 100 feet of each other, the drinkers share equally in any wounds they take, as per shield other. If a drinker moves more than 100 feet from any other drinker, the shield other effect is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the drinker moves within range again. These effects last for 3 hours. A bottle of wine of concordance contains six glasses' worth of wine.

# Cassomir
Amulet of Natural Armor +2.COPY=Amulet of Water Parting																																																				COST:10000	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.9																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|moderate transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|11th		QUALITY:Slot|neck				QUALITY:Construction Cost|5,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, barkskin, control water																																																																																																																																																															DESC:.CLEAR					DESC:This amulet of natural armor +2 is carved from blackwood and often takes abstract artistic forms that incorporate motifs of waves or moving water. When worn, an amulet of water parting confers additional protection from damaging water effects, providing a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells or effects with the water descriptor as well as a +2 deflection bonus to AC against any such spells or effects that require an attack roll. 

# Goka
Crackling Tassel																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:2500	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.10																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|moderate evocation						QUALITY:Caster Level|6th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,250 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, defensive shock, hypnotism																																																																																																																																																														DESCISPI:YES				DESC:A common accoutrement often crafted by worshipers of Hei Feng, these magical tassels are usually affixed to the pommels of bladed weapons, though they can be fastened to other weapons as well. The tassel has no effect unless attached to a weapon, and even then, it activates only under certain conditions. The wielder gains a +4 circumstance bonus on performance combat checks. When the wielder takes a standard action to fight defensively, the next attack that misses her before the start of her next round causes the attacker to take 3d6 points of electricity damage. Once the electricity is discharged, the crackling tassel can't be used again for 24 hours.
Dianxue Gloves																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Hands.Glove																												COST:3000	WT:0	SLOTS:2													SOURCEPAGE:p.10																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint divination						QUALITY:Caster Level|5th		QUALITY:Slot|hands				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, status, true strike, creator must have 5 ranks in Heal																																																																																																																																																							DESCISPI:YES				DESC:Thought to have been developed by disciples of Soong Bai, the famous promulgator of acupuncture, these gloves grant their wearer powerful skills in the arts of healing - and harming - living beings. The wearer of a pair of dianxue gloves gains a +4 competence bonus on Heal checks to provide first aid, long-term care, and to treat deadly wounds for living, humanoid creatures. In addition, the wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits with unarmed strikes or with natural weapons against living humanoid creatures.
Neili Robes																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Body.Robe																												COST:10000	WT:1															SOURCEPAGE:p.10																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|moderate abjuration					QUALITY:Caster Level|11th		QUALITY:Slot|body				QUALITY:Construction Cost|5,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have a ki pool																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:This black-and-white robe is specially crafted to help the wearer regulate the flow of ki in his body, allowing for the generation of internal strength. Once per round when the wearer spends a ki point, he gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC and a +1 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 round. If the wearer spends another ki point before the end of his next turn, the duration is extended by 1 round and the natural armor and enhancement bonuses are increased by 1 (to a maximum of +4). The bonuses to AC and Strength last for only 1 round following the expenditure of the last ki point.

# Iadara
Gown of Graceful Petiteness																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Body.Robe																												COST:3500	WT:1															SOURCEPAGE:p.12																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|1st		QUALITY:Slot|body				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,750 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, reduce person, creatore must be an elf																																																																																																																																																											DESCISPI:YES				DESC:These fine dresses are delicately woven with magically preserved and layered leaves. The dresses were originally commissioned for elven diplomats who often interacted with gnomes and other members of Small races, but their use has spread across Avistan. A Medium humanoid who takes 1 interrupted minute to don a gown of graceful petiteness is, at the end of that time, immediately reduced to Small size. This acts as reduce person, except that it does not grant a size bonus to Dexterity or resize items on the wearer's person other than the gown itself. Taking off the gown also requires 1 interrupted minute and returns the gown and its wearer to their original sizes.
Ring of Starlight																										TYPE:Magic.Ring																																COST:1600																	SOURCEPAGE:p.12																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint evocation						QUALITY:Caster Level|1st		QUALITY:Slot|ring				QUALITY:Construction Cost|800 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Forge Ring, dancing lights, faerie fire																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:This smooth mithral ring glimmers with light, and a close look reveals the reflection of a starry night sky within the silvery metal. The wearer of a ring of starlight can cause portions of her body or items in her possession to glow with colorful light, as per faerie fire, by waving the hand adorned with the ring over the item or body part as a swift action. This glow lasts for 1 hour, until dismissed as a free action, or until the ring is removed. This duration need not be used all at once, but must be used in 10-minute increments. (Each time an increment of duration is used, the wearer can choose the portion of her body or item in her possession that glows.) In addition, wearing the ring allows the caster to use dancing lights on command three times per day as a standard action.
Veil of Attentiveness																									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Head																													COST:750	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.12																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|1st		QUALITY:Slot|head				QUALITY:Construction Cost|375 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, keen senses																																																																																																																																																																		DESCISPI:YES				DESC:This gauzy veil sharpens the wearer's hearing, enhances her ability to interpret others' words, and improves her ability to perceive multiple conversations simultaneously. Veils of attentiveness have historically been popular among Iadaran diplomats or savvy elven political players in densely populated places. They are still especially prized in crowded areas where nobles gather, such as royal courts or upscale dining and lounging establishments in Iadara and beyond. The wearer of a veil of attentiveness gains a +2 competence bonus on hearing-based Perception checks and on Sense Motive checks to interpret others' meaning or to detect possible deception. In addition, when listening to multiple speakers' voices, the wearer of a veil of attentiveness can understand each speaker as though she were listening only to that voice.

# Kalsgard
Hexbiter Charm																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Charm																													COST:180																	SOURCEPAGE:p.13																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint abjuration						QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|neck or shoulder	QUALITY:Construction Cost|90 gp			QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, resistance																			SPROP:a charm can occupy either the neck or shoulder slot and can share with a single other magic item in that slot, but can only be used once																																																																																																																			DESC:This walrus-shaped charm is typically carved from ivory or bone. When targeted by a witch's hex or an effect with the curse descriptor, the wearer can activate this charm as an immediate action to gain a +3 resistance bonus on the saving throw to resist the curse effect. If the wearer is affected by the curse effect, he gains a +2 bonus on any subsequent saving throws to resist the effect for up to 1 week, and he gains a +3 bonus on any caster level checks he attempts to remove the effect (such as with remove curse) during this time.
Lynx Eye Charm																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Charm																													COST:350																	SOURCEPAGE:p.13																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint divination and transmutation		QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|neck or shoulder	QUALITY:Construction Cost|175 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision, see invisibility															SPROP:a charm can occupy either the neck or shoulder slot and can share with a single other magic item in that slot, but can only be used once																																																																																																																			DESC:This charm is typically spherical in shape and a mottled amber in color. A natural inclusion in this amber charm gives it the appearance of an eye. When activated as a swift action, the lynx eye charm grants its wearer low-light vision for 3 minutes. If activated as a standard action, the charm instead grants its wearer the benefits of darkvision or see invisibility for 3 rounds.
Rimeshaper Gloves																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Hands.Glove																												COST:3000	WT:1	SLOTS:2													SOURCEPAGE:p.13																																																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|ColdResistanceBonus|5|TYPE=Resistance																																																																																																												QUALITY:Aura|faint abjuration and transmutation		QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|hands				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, resist energy, chill metal or icicle dagger																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:These sleek gloves bear a faint scaled pattern and shimmer slightly, as if they were covered in ice crystals. While in cold or colder weather, rimeshaper gloves allow the wearer to solidify nearby snow or ice into a light or one-handed weapon of normal quality with a hardness of 2. Creating such a weapon takes the same amount of time that it would take to draw it from a sheath - a move action for most, but faster for a wearer with the Quick Draw feat or a similar ability, for example. These weapons evaporate if left unattended for 1 round; otherwise, they last for 1 minute, after which they melt into pure liquid. Alternatively, as a move action, the wearer can cause actual ice crystals to form over the gloves, causing them to act as masterwork spiked gauntlets that also grant a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks. This effect lasts until it is dismissed as a standard action. Finally, the gloves grant the wearer cold resistance 5.

# Katapesh
Armguards of Waning Hope																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Hands.Glove																												COST:25000	WT:1	SLOTS:2													SOURCEPAGE:p.14		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 2|CHARGES[2]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|moderate enchantment					QUALITY:Caster Level|9th		QUALITY:Slot|hands				QUALITY:Construction Cost|12,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, siphon magic																																																																																																																																																																									DESC:Runes spiral and skitter across these leather bracers, which are adorned with small spikes. Twice per day, as a swift action after making a successful attack against a creature, the wearer can say the command word to steal all morale bonuses from which the creature is benefiting (this includes morale bonuses on attack rolls, on checks, to AC, or to any other statistics). These bonuses affect the wearer instead of the creature for 9 rounds. After this duration, if the morale bonuses' durations haven't elapsed, the bonuses cease affecting the wearer and resume affecting the original creature as normal. If the wearer attempts to activate this effect against a creature not benefiting from any morale bonuses, a daily use of the item is wasted.
Badge of Veiled Authority																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:3500	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.14		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 2|CHARGES[2]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|faint illusion							QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,750 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:This golden badge has a snake etched onto it that shimmers slightly in the sunlight. Twice per day as a standard action, the wearer can tap the badge. When she does, the badge transforms into one identical to those worn by the local law enforcement of the city or town in which the wearer is located. This effect lasts for 3 hours each time it is activated, though the wearer can dismiss the effect as a free action. Additionally, while this badge's magic is active, it provides the wearer with a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks. Once the badge's magic has been activated, any creature can wear it in its transformed form and receive the bonus on Bluff checks, though only the original wearer can end the effect before its duration has elapsed. If members of the town or city's law enforcement do not wear badges, activating this item has no physical effect, but the wearer still receives the bonus on Bluff checks while the effect lasts. A creature that interacts with the badge while its magic is active (such as by examining it closely or touching it) can recognize that the badge is fake with a successful DC 14 Will saving throw.
Bag of Holding (Type I).COPY=Looter's Satchel																			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Container		CONTAINS:*250																							COST:3200	WT:15															SOURCEPAGE:p.14																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|moderate conjuration					QUALITY:Caster Level|9th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,600 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, mage hand, secret chest																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:This maroon satchel is embroidered with slightly glowing runes. The satchel functions as a bag of holding (type I). Additionally, as long as the satchel is not overloaded, the bearer can hold it over an adjacent creature that is dead or unconscious and speak a command word. When the command word is spoken, the satchel removes any magic items from the creature's person (such as magic weapons and armor, potions, scrolls, and wondrous items) and deposits them into the bag. This process takes 1 uninterrupted round. If the bearer moves into a different space while the satchel is gathering items in this way, no items are moved into the satchel and the bearer must start the process over. If the satchel would become overloaded from the creature's magic items, it transports as many magic items as it can, from smallest to largest, until it would become overloaded, at which point it stops gathering items.
Necklace of Bloody Incisors																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Neck																													COST:1850	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.14		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 10 Maximum|CHARGES[10]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|neck				QUALITY:Construction Cost|925 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, magic fang (greater)																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:This thin iron chain holds up to 10 extracted teeth of common predatory animals strung along it. As a move action, the wearer can place up to three teeth into a thrown splash weapon or an alchemist's bomb. When such a splash weapon or bomb hits a target, it deals an additional 1d4 points of slashing damage per tooth used. Each tooth used in such a splash weapon or bomb also increases its splash damage by 2 points of slashing damage per tooth. Once all of the necklace's teeth are used in this way, the necklace's magic is expended. A newly purchased necklace of bloody incisors contains 10 extracted teeth.
Fervent Searcher's Gloves																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Hands.Glove																												COST:7400	WT:0	SLOTS:2													SOURCEPAGE:p.15		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 2|CHARGES[2]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|5th		QUALITY:Slot|hands				QUALITY:Construction Cost|3,700 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, residual tracking																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:These dark blue, silken gloves are fingerless. Twice per day as a move action, the wearer can touch the ground or any other solid surface and say the command word to visibly reveal all footprints within 20 feet. When the gloves reveal footprints in this way, the wearer gains a +5 bonus on Survival checks to follow those tracks.
Gorget of Umbral Hunger																									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Neck																													COST:6500	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.15		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 20|CHARGES[20]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															QUALITY:Aura|faint conjuration						QUALITY:Caster Level|5th		QUALITY:Slot|neck				QUALITY:Construction Cost|3,250 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, infernal healing																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:This intricately decorated bronze necklace fits tightly across the neck and houses a ruby in its center. Whenever the wearer of the necklace is in an area of dim light or darkness, including magical darkness, the ruby begins to glow and grants the wearer fast healing 1. The necklace can restore up to 20 hit points per day, after which its fast healing effect ends and the gorget becomes inert until its magic resets the next day. This fast healing can restore hit points regardless of the source of the damage, but the wearer detects as an evil creature while the gorget's fast healing ability is active. This has no long-term effect on the wearer's alignment.
Lantern of the Shining Truth																							TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:5400	WT:2															SOURCEPAGE:p.15		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|faint conjuration and evocation		QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|2,700 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, glitterdust, light																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:This lightweight iron lantern houses a citrine gemstone that shines brightly with arcane energy as if affected by a permanent light spell. The bearer can suppress the lantern's light or cause it to resume with a command word. Additionally, once per day by saying a different command word, the bearer can use the lantern to cast glitterdust n a 10-foot-radius spread. Any creature caught in the effect must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be blinded for 3 rounds.
Quill of Passage																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:5000	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.15		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 3|CHARGES[3]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|5th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|2,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, knock, open and shut																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:This black-feathered quill has a glowing nib with a small amount of glowing ink inside it. Three times per day, the bearer can place the quill's nib against a wall and say a command word to cause the ink to flow from the pen and draw a doorway onto the wall. The doorway persists for 10 minutes, during which any number of creatures can spend a move action to walk through the door as if it were real. Doorways can be created in this way only on walls that are no more than 6 inches thick. Additionally, a doorway cannot be created if the space on the other side of the targeted wall is blocked (such as by solid stone or dirt, furniture, or another impediment). If the bearer attempts to create a doorway in such an impossible place, the quill's ink simply doesn't flow and a daily use of this item is not expended.

# Katheer
Incense of Golden Embers																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																												COST:2800	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.17																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|moderate necromancy					QUALITY:Caster Level|7th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,400 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, elemental body I																																														QUALITY:Plural|No																																																																																																																						DESC:When burned, this stick of incense releases a sharp smell and fills the surrounding air with bright orange and golden motes. A creature that lights this incense (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and breathes the smoke for 1 minute gains the fire subtype for 1 hour. This grants the creature immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold for the duration of the effect. The price listed is for a single stick of incense, which is enough for only one creature to use and benefit from as described.

# Kerse
Alabaster Trapping																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Body.Robe																												COST:3500	WT:1															SOURCEPAGE:p.18		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|faint evocation						QUALITY:Caster Level|5th		QUALITY:Slot|body				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,750 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, force punch, prestidigitation																																																																																																																																																													DESCISPI:YES				DESC:Sewn in the traditional style of the Kalistocracy, this white robe bears several golden embellishments. The robe is under a constant prestidigitation spell that removes any dirt or stains while preventing wrinkles. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can repel one creature physically touching her (such as a creature targeting her with a touch spell or a combat maneuver). The target of this effect takes 5d4 points of force damage and is pushed 10 feet in a direction specified by the wearer.
Boots of Flawless Resolve																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Feet.Boot																												COST:6500	WT:2	SLOTS:2													SOURCEPAGE:p.18		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 3|CHARGES[3]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|moderate divination					QUALITY:Caster Level|7th		QUALITY:Slot|feet				QUALITY:Construction Cost|7,250 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, anticipate thoughts																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:These knee-high white leather boots are covered in delicate lines of gemstones and precious metals that are almost imperceptible to the average human eye. Three times per day as a move action, the wearer can declare a single creature within 30 feet as his target. The wearer gains a +2 insight bonus to AC against the target's attacks and a +4 bonus to CMD against combat maneuvers the target attempts against him. This effect lasts for up to 7 rounds, but it ends immediately if the wearer takes any move action that would move him out of his square (not including a 5-foot step, but including movement such as flying) or if he is moved out of his square involuntarily, such as by a successful bull rush combat maneuver that pushes him backward. If the target dies, the effect immediately ends, and declaring a new target requires expending another use. If the wearer declares a new target before the effect on the previous target ends, the effect on the previous target ends immediately, and declaring the new target expends another use.

Magnate's Miter																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Head																													COST:90000	WT:1															SOURCEPAGE:p.18		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|strong enchantment						QUALITY:Caster Level|18th		QUALITY:Slot|head				QUALITY:Construction Cost|45,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, divide mind, possession, tower of iron will V																																																																																																																																																									DESCISPI:YES				DESC:This alabaster headdress is studded with lines of delicate rubies and represents the height of Kersite fashion mixed with Kalistocratic needs. These austere headdresses come with an imbued soul - one utterly dedicated to assisting the adherents of the Prophecies of Kalistrade unto death. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can allow the personality within the miter to rise to the fore of her own consciousness. This effect lasts for 1 minute, during which the wearer can roll twice and use the higher result for all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer can activate this ability after such a skill check has been rolled but before the result is determined, allowing for a reroll. Additionally, once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can gain the benefits of tower of iron will V, as the possessing spirit rises to block any mental effects against the wearer. This ability can be used regardless of whether the miter's other ability is active.
Bounteous Bath Suffusion																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																												COST:1200	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.19																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|strong conjuration						QUALITY:Caster Level|12th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|600 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, neutralize poison, remove disease																																																																																																																																																												DESCISPI:YES				DESC:The Kalistocracy maintains harsh strictures against physical contact with other creatures, but in the thick of battle or by the winds of fate, sometimes contact cannot be avoided. To alleviate the soul taint associated with such contact, the wealthiest Kalistocrats employ magically imbued bathing additives to remove the uncleanliness of outside contact. A single bounteous bath suffusion can be used to fill a bath with enough water for a single Medium or Large creature. A living creature that spends 20 minutes in such a treated bath receives the benefits of both neutralize poison (only the option to neutralize poison affecting the suffusion's user) and remove disease. The bathing creature also gains a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against diseases and poisons for the next 24 hours.
Necklace of Ensured Return																								TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Neck																													COST:120000	WT:1															SOURCEPAGE:p.19																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|strong necromancy						QUALITY:Caster Level|18th		QUALITY:Slot|neck				QUALITY:Construction Cost|60,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, nondetection, trap the soul, true resurrection																																																																																																																																																																DESC:This lavish necklace is crafted from gold and interwoven bands of silver. The coils of precious metal end in a receptacle bearing a pristine opal gemstone. The necklace does not radiate a magic aura unless viewed with true seeing or a similarly powerful spell. If the wearer is slain, her soul is immediately moved into the gemstone on the necklace, as per trap the soul. At the time of her death while wearing this necklace, the wearer whose soul is moved into its gemstone must choose a period of time ranging from 1 to 14 days. (The period of time selected can be more specific but must be measured in an increment no smaller than an hour; for example, 3 days and 6 hours.) After the selected amount of time passes, the gemstone shatters, releasing the dead wearer's soul. Her body then immediately re-forms in a space within 60 feet of where the gem shattered, regardless of the condition of her body at the time of her death, as per true resurrection. If the gem is destroyed prior to the elapsing of the specified time, the dead wearer's body re-forms immediately. The individual whose soul is released from the necklace can choose where her body re-forms at the time the gem shatters. Once the former wearer is resurrected, the necklace turns to lead and becomes worthless.

As long as one or more creatures can see it, the ring grants its wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to influence those creatures. In addition, the wearer can allow a willing creature to inspect the ring as a full-round action. If she does, for the following 3 rounds the creature and the wearer can speak while the ring's power obfuscates the details of the conversation. To every other creature able to hear the creature and the wearer's words during this time, the conversation sounds like a continued back-and-forth exchange of exaltations about the ring's artistry.

As an immediate action, as long as the wearer of the blight siphoner has one hand free and has the needle within easy reach, she can stab herself with the needle when she attempts a Fortitude saving throw against a disease she has contracted. This grants the user a +2 competence bonus on that saving throw. In addition, if the user succeeds at the saving throw, it counts as two consecutive saves for the purpose of curing the disease. Once the user has succeeded at a saving throw against a disease using the blight siphoner, the needle shatters and the item is destroyed.
Jungle Seeker's Monocle																									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:12400	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.20																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint conjuration						QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|6,200 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, acute senses																																																																																																																																																																		DESCISPI:YES				DESC:The lens of this classical monocle is made of carefully shaped Shory glass. By looking through the lens, a wearer of a jungle seeker's monocle can find hidden creatures even in the thickest of jungles. The wearer can use Perception to detect the presence of other living creatures up to 3d6 ×10 feet away in any forest, treating it as if it were a sparse forest. The monocle also grants a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice creatures using Stealth, regardless whether the wearer is in a forest or elsewhere.

# Magnimar
Harborwing Cloak						NAMEISPI:YES																	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Shoulders.Cloak																											COST:5200	WT:1															SOURCEPAGE:p.22		EQMOD:Material ~ Cloth.Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 3|CHARGES[3]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|shoulders			QUALITY:Construction Cost|2,600 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, create water, feather fall, invisibility, creator must worship Ylimancha																																																																																																																																																			DESCISPI:YES				DESC:This white-hooded cloak is trimmed with seagull feathers. The cloak billows in the slightest breeze, and when the hood is drawn over the wearer's head, the cloak repels rainwater and seaspray, keeping the wearer dry. Harborwing cloaks were made by Varisian mystery cultists (and put to less-sacred uses by Sczarni bandits) for centuries before Magnimar's founding, though they are used more widely today. Many who worship Ylimancha, empyreal lord of coastal waters, fisherfolk, and flying creatures, wear these cloaks. Three times per day, whenever the wearer of this cloak falls more than 5 feet, she can spend an immediate action to gain the benefits of feather fall. In addition, once per day, the wearer can command the cloak as a standard action to become a sheet of rippling, flowing water, causing attacks against her to take a 20%% miss chance. While the cloak is in this liquid-like state, the wearer can use the Stealth skill to hide in rainy conditions (or similar areas, such as the spray of a waterfall) even if she is being observed, and she gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in such conditions. This effect lasts for 3 minutes, and the duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
Scarves of the Stinging Dancer																							TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Chest.Shirt																												COST:9000	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.22		EQMOD:Material ~ Cloth.Special Ability ~ Charged Item / 50 Maximum|CHARGES[50]																																																																																																																																																												BONUS:SKILL|Perform (Dance)|2|TYPE=Circumstance																																																																																																																																		QUALITY:Aura|faint evocation						QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|chest				QUALITY:Construction Cost|4,500 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, magic missile, creator must worship Calistria																																																																																																																																																									DESCISPI:YES				DESC:Made to enhance the most seductive Varisian dances, this collection of silken scarves is patterned in yellow and black. Varisian worshipers of Calistria weave these scarves in the shadow of the Irespan, drawing upon the ancient evocation magic they call ragario to imbue the silk with vengeful energies. Scarves of the stinging dancer grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (dance) checks, similar to that granted by masterwork musical instruments; this effect is nonmagical and cannot be dispelled. To activate the scarves' magic, the wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Perform (dance) check. This check can be attempted as part of a move action in which the wearer moves no more than half his speed (including when he uses the Acrobatics skill to avoid enemies) or as part of an attack action or full attack in which the wearer uses only a bladed scarf to attack. Once activated, the scarves' magic lasts until the beginning of the wearer's next turn. While the scarves' magic is active, whenever the wearer is successfully targeted by a harmful spell, hit by a melee or ranged attack, or touched against his will, the scarves lash out at the source of the attack (a creature if it's a spellcaster or an individual holding a magic item, or an object if the source is a trap or otherwise unattended) with a magic missile (CL 3rd). This missile takes the form of an angrily buzzing wasp. The scarves can be deactivated as a free action. The scarves of the stinging dancer can create 50 missiles before losing their magic. At this point, the scarves can no longer cast magic missile, but they still provide the +2 bonus on Perform (dance) checks.

A creature holding an exorcist ofuda gains a +3 bonus on Perception checks to notice a haunt when the haunt's effects manifest. Additionally, as a standard action the exorcist ofuda can be triggered to grant all allies within 30 feet a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws and a +2 deflection bonus to AC against a haunt's effects for 1 round. Triggering the ofuda this way destroys it in a gout of flame.
Khangarad Scabbard																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Belt																													COST:6000	WT:2															SOURCEPAGE:p.24		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|moderate evocation						QUALITY:Caster Level|9th		QUALITY:Slot|belt				QUALITY:Construction Cost|3,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, gust of wind																																																																																																																																																																									DESC:This belt-and-scabbard set is decorated with golden depictions of garudas. The scabbard automatically reshapes itself to fit the weapon that the wielder is currently using. If the wielder is not using a weapon that would fit into a scabbard, as a free action the wielder can command the khangarad scabbard to take the shape of any weapon with which she has proficiency. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can speak the scabbard's command word to blast nearby creatures with gale-force winds. As part of activating the scabbard, the wielder can attempt a special trip combat maneuver check against all creatures within 10 feet using her normal CMB; this does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures whose CMD is lower than the result are tripped. The wielder is not knocked down if the trip attempt fails by 10 or more.
Skyspirit Stone																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																												COST:2000	WT:.5															SOURCEPAGE:p.24																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|faint conjuration						QUALITY:Caster Level|5th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, lesser restoration																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:This object was naturally struck by lightning and imbued with a spirit of the sky. Despite the name, this object does not have to be a stone, though small objects made into skyspirit stones are the most common, convenient, and prized. Once per day, the stone can be placed in liquor or milk for 1 minute to infuse the liquid with the spirit's power. A kineticist with the air elemental focus (aerokineticist) can drink this liquid as a move action to gain assistance from the spirit's power. For 1 hour after drinking the liquid, the kineticist can negate a single point of burn gained from using her kineticist abilities (this does not heal the associated nonlethal damage from the point of burn). This effect does not stack with itself.

Banner of Piracy																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:2500	WT:10															SOURCEPAGE:p.25		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|faint transmutation					QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|1,250 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, prestidigitation																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:Three small metal rings adorn one side of this long, rectangular piece of black fabric, which shimmers with magic. Once per day, if the banner is attached to the mast of a ship or other water- faring vessel, a passenger on board who has line of sight to the banner can say its command word and the name of a port of her choice to transform the banner into one of that port for the next 24 hours, complete with the correct colors and heraldry, as appropriate. When the banner transforms, it also transforms all flags and labels identifying the ship or vessel, including any on the ship's cargo if that cargo is labeled with a place of origin or destination. If the banner is removed from the mast of the ship at any time while it is obscuring its port of call, the banner and all identifying flags and labels on the ship revert to their original state. Flags and labels affected in this way all radiate a faint aura of transmutation magic, and if the magic affecting one flag or label (or the banner of piracy itself) is suppressed, such as with dispel magic, all of the banner's magic is suppressed. Creatures that interact with banners, cargo, flags, or similar labels affected by this banner (such as by examining them very closely or touching them) can see through the banner's magic with a successful DC 14 Will saving throw.
Captain's Eye Patch																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Eyes																													COST:46000	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.25																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|moderate divination					QUALITY:Caster Level|11th		QUALITY:Slot|eyes				QUALITY:Construction Cost|23,000 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision, true seeing																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:This black velvet eye patch is attached to an onyx chain that is worn around the head. The eye patch grants its wearer darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can speak the eye patch's command word to see through powerful magical darkness, such as an area of deeper darkness, for up to 11 minutes per day. This duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Ending this effect is a free action.

When they are worn, the boots grant their wearer a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks. In addition, once per day, the wearer can say a command word to gain the effects of spider climb for up to 30 minutes. This effect can be dismissed as a free action.

Guardian Figurehead																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:1350	WT:50															SOURCEPAGE:p.26		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|faint abjuration						QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|675 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, entropic shield																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:This elegantly carved figurehead typically depicts a fantastic magical creature, divine figure, or local hero, and it is either attached to the prow of a sailing vessel or carved into the hull of the ship. Once per day, the figurehead can be activated by speaking its command word as a swift action, awakening its protective power for 1 minute. While the figurehead is active, all ranged attacks originating from anywhere other than the ship have a 20%% miss chance against the vessel and anyone aboard it. This ability has no effect on melee attacks, rays, or ranged attacks that do not require an attack roll to hit (such as magic missile).
Sea Silk Shell																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:4500	WT:.5															SOURCEPAGE:p.26																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Aura|moderate conjuration					QUALITY:Caster Level|7th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|2,250 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, minor creation																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:This small clamshell magically contains a 300-square-foot sheet of sea silk, which is an extremely fine, valuable, and strong fabric woven from the filaments of pen shells. The sea silk has hardness 10 and 15 hit points, and it cannot be ruined by exposure to water or other mundane means (though spells that target it still work as normal). As a standard action the shell's user can speak a command word and pull the silk sheet from the shell in one of three different forms chosen at that time. The silk can emerge as 60 squares of sails ready to be installed (enough to propel most Colossal or smaller water vehicles), which can be magically treated as normal. Alternatively, the silk can emerge as up to 15 total noble's outfits or royal's outfits in any style and color the user wishes. As a third option, the silk can emerge as an unaltered sheet that can be cut and sewn as normal into any objects that could be made from cloth, except that the silk cannot be used to create weapons or functional armor. Once the silk has been pulled from the shell, the shell remains empty until the silk is returned to it or destroyed. Once adjacent to the shell, the outfits, sheet of silk, or sails can be placed back into the shell with a second command word. (If the sheet was cut into pieces, all pieces must be adjacent to the shell before the silk can be returned.) Any damage to the silk or items made from it are undone by returning the cloth to the shell. If the silk or any items made from it are destroyed, the sea silk shell remains inert for a week as it regenerates the cloth from scratch, after which the shell can be used again as normal.

These wooden statuettes serve as watchful guardians, alerting travelers when there is danger and summoning an eagle ally to fight the threat. Each day, the guardian's wielder must designate up to five allies, including himself, to be alerted of an intruder's presence. When a creature approaches within 20 feet of an unattended caravan guardian (or its wielder, if a creature has the guardian on their person), that creature must speak the command word within 1 round or an eagle appears in a space next to the statue and attacks whatever creature triggered it. Additionally, the caravan guardian sends all designated creatures a mental warning, as per the mental alarm use of the alarm spell (if the guardian's wielder did not designate allies to be alerted that day, the item alerts the most recently designated allies). If there is no appropriate space for the eagle to be summoned into, it does not appear, but the caravan guardian still sends a mental alarm. A caravan guardian can summon only one eagle per day.
Horse-Caller Flute																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																															COST:4200	WT:0															SOURCEPAGE:p.27		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Aura|moderate conjuration					QUALITY:Caster Level|4th		QUALITY:Slot|none				QUALITY:Construction Cost|2,100 gp		QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound, mount																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:The body of this wooden flute is elaborately decorated with carved motifs of horses running across grassy plains. Once per day, the user of a horse-caller flute can play a lilting melody with the flute, and while doing so can attempt a DC 10 Perform (wind) check. On a success, a light riding horse appears in an appropriate space adjacent to the player to serve as her mount for 2 hours, plus an additional 2 hours for every 5 points by which the result exceeds the Perform (wind) check DC. The horse does not appear if the terrain cannot support it; in this case, if the user succeeds at the Perform (wind) check, the horse simply does not appear and the item's daily use is not wasted.
