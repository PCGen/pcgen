SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Blessing of Prosperity				KEY:Knight of Coins ~ Blessing of Prosperity										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Features.KnightOfCoinsClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																															DESC:A knight of coins is a patron of wealth and seeks to even the playing field for those who have unfair economic disadvantages. By expending a use of lay on hands, the knight of coins can instead grant a boon to herself or a creature touched as a standard action. These boons do not stack with themselves or with blessings from another knight of coins. A blessing of prosperity lasts up to 1 hour, though the knight of coins who bestowed it can end a blessing's benefits early (whether it affects her or another creature) as a free action. Using this ability requires only one free hand and is a standard action, unless the knight of coins targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. If she knows multiple blessings of prosperity, the knight of coins can bestow multiple blessings on a single target as part of the action and the expenditure of a use of lay on hands required to use this ability. If she bestows multiple different blessings, these blessings are cumulative. Once a blessing of prosperity is chosen, it can't be changed. A character who has benefited from a blessing of prosperity cannot benefit from that same blessing again (whether bestowed by the same knight of coins or another knight of coins) for 24 hours.

Harmless Guise						KEY:Nameless Shadow ~ Harmless Guise												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Features.NamelessShadowClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																															DESC:A nameless shadow gains the dual identity and seamless guise vigilante class features, with the following restrictions. Her social identity must be that of a mundane and nonthreatening member of society, such as a farmer or a merchant. Additionally, when a nameless shadow attacks a foe while in a social or mundane identity, her target takes a –2 penalty to AC for the purpose of resolving that attack. This use of harmless guise forces the nameless shadow into her vigilante identity after the attack is completed, and the target (if it survives) then becomes aware of the nameless shadow's secret. This ability cannot be used on targets that are aware of the nameless shadow's dual identity.

DESC: She can use this ability to hide within a crowd even if she is being observed.|PRECLASS:1,Rogue=8																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Dual Identity						KEY:Nameless Shadow ~ Dual Identity													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Features.NamelessShadowClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																															DESC:A nameless shadow hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the nameless shadow has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the nameless shadow usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his nameless shadow name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the nameless shadow's true identity revealed to the world at large. The nameless shadow can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or nameless shadow. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the nameless shadow's secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user's appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the nameless shadow to be in his social identity, but a nameless shadow who uses nameless shadow talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret. Despite being a single person, a nameless shadow's dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity's alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A nameless shadow's two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a nameless shadow with a lawful neutral social identity could have a nameless shadow identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a nameless shadow is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the nameless shadow work only if the nameless shadow is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.
Seamless Guise						KEY:Nameless Shadow ~ Seamless Guise												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Features.NamelessShadowClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																						DEFINE:SeamlessGuiseBonus|0			DESC:A nameless shadow knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or nameless shadow identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +%1 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.|SeamlessGuiseBonus																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|SeamlessGuiseBonus|20

Many of these inquisitors previously oversaw religious vows in more formal settings, though more pursue more lucrative contracts. Wronged merchants or cheated customers often seek out oathkeepers to bring justice when local authorities fail.

Divine Witness						KEY:Oathkeeper ~ Divine Witness														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Inquisitor Class Features.OathkeeperClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																															DESC:Every oathkeeper inquisitor develops a unique personal symbol, which she can use to seal an agreement between two or more willing parties. The agreement, whether it's a trade contract, a truce, or a political marriage, must be as detailed as possible and then signed in the oathkeeper's presence by every creature involved. Creatures must sign of their own free will-any magical or physical coercion will cause the contract to crumble into ash when the oathkeeper attempts to place her seal upon it. So long as no mystic or physical force is influencing any participating creature, the oathkeeper can mystically seal the arrangement with her personal symbol, binding all signing parties into upholding their ends of the bargain for the length of time spelled out in the agreement. Should any oathbound creature break the exact wording of the contract, the agreement is dissolved and the offending creature is cursed, taking a penalty on all d20 rolls equal to the oathkeeper's Wisdom modifier for a number of weeks equal to the oathkeeper's inquisitor level. Furthermore, the inquisitor's symbol appears as a mystic symbol on the offending creature's throat and hands, allowing the oathkeeper to know the creature's location at all times, as per the discern location spell. If a creature is forced into breaking the agreement by magic or overwhelming physical force (for example, breaking an agreement not to harm via a compulsion spell or by physically hurling an oathbound creature to deal damage to another), then the agreement dissipates harmlessly. The oathkeeper's curse is a curse effect, but it can be removed only with a miracle or wish spell.	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Oathbreaker's Scourge				KEY:Oathkeeper ~ Oathbreaker's Scourge												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Inquisitor Class Features.OathkeeperClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																															DESC:if an oathkeeper is given physical evidence of a broken agreement and asked to hunt down the contract's breaker by the offended party, the oathkeeper gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Diplomacy and Survival skill checks to gather information about and track the target. The inquisitor is also treated as being 3 levels higher for the purpose of one judgment she uses against the deal breaker, so long as she keeps possession of the evidence. If the oathkeeper uses oathbreaker's scourge when attacking someone who is actually innocent of fraud-due to forgery, hasty judgments, or other deceptions-she loses access to all of her oathkeeper archetype abilities for 1 month or until she is the target of an atonement spell.

Edicts								KEY:Order of the Reins ~ Edicts														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																																																																																																															DESC:The cavalier must do everything in his power to keep a caravan or traveling group safe once he has agreed to protect it. He must see that any allied animal injured under his watch is healed, or personally give it a merciful death if survival is not an option. He must not let any animal under his command suffer needlessly.
Control the Herd					KEY:Order of the Reins ~ Control the Herd											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																						DESC:The cavalier can direct multiple animals with one forceful command. The cavalier can handle a number of nonhostile, riderless animals equal to his cavalier level with a single use of the Handle Animal skill, so long as the commanded animals can see or hear the cavalier. The handled animals must all be ordered to perform the same trick. If an animal in the group does not know the trick the cavalier is commanding them to perform, the cavalier is considered to be pushing that animal. The cavalier cannot use this ability on animals more than two size categories smaller than he is. Using this ability requires a move action, though if the cavalier is pushing any animal as described above, it requires a full-round action.
Teamwork Tricks						KEY:Order of the Reins ~ Teamwork Tricks											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																						DESC:The cavalier can use control the herd to handle allied and riderless animals and animal companions. Friendly and helpful animals that the cavalier commands with Handle Animal or his control the herd ability are considered to know any tasks or tricks the cavalier’s mount knows, in addition to any tasks or tricks they already know.
Stampede							KEY:Order of the Reins ~ Stampede													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																						DESC:As a standard action, the cavalier can incite any riderless and nonhostile animals and animal companions within 60 feet of him to stampede. Each affected creature gains a +4 bonus to AC (this bonus stacks with the benefits of the cavalier’s challenge), the trample universal monster rule, and a bonus to damage equal to half the cavalier’s level for 1 round. The save DC against an incited animal’s trample attack is 10 + half the cavalier’s level + his Charisma modifier. Incited creatures attack whatever targets the cavalier directs them to unless commanded otherwise by a bonded master (in the case of a familiar or animal companion).
