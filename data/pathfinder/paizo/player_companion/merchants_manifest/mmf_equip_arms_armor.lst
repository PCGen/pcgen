# Absalom
Andoren Emancipation Hammer			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Warhammer				NAMEISPI:YES								TYPE:Weapon.Magic.Resizable.Melee.Martial.OneHanded.Bludgeoning.Hammer.Weapon Group Hammers																COST:12		WT:5					CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8					EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|11000.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Material ~ Steel																		WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.4																						DESCISPI:YES		DESC:A broken chain link of tempered steel is embedded in the head of this +1 warhammer. If the wielder successfully uses the hammer to make an attack or perform a sunder combat maneuver against a nonmagical metal chain or an object made of nonmagical chain links (excluding weapons or armor), it deals an additional 2d6 points of damage. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can speak a command word to attempt to remove a compulsion spell or effect from a willing creature that is within 30 feet, as per break enchantment. The owner can use this ability as long as she has the Andoren emancipation hammer on her person, even if she's not wielding it; however, when targeting an unwilling creature, the wielder must succeed at a touch attack, and may choose to forgo the damage that would usually be dealt. (If the wielder's attack misses, the hammer's magic is not expended.) The owner of the hammer can use this ability to remove a compulsion from herself, as long as the compulsion doesn't prevent it.
Cathedral Pit Stone					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Splash Weapon														TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable.Weapon.Ranged.Thrown.Splash																							COST:600	WT:0																																																																											RANGE:20	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.5																						DESCISPI:YES		DESC:A golden ribbon winds around this smooth, ring-shaped piece of basalt, which was created to emulate the pit of the Starstone. The stone can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When the stone strikes a target, it creates a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep moat, as per create pit, leaving the target on a stone pillar equal in size to its space. Alternatively, the user can target a specific grid intersection (or merely drop the stone, which requires no attack roll) to create a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep moat around the 5-foot square onto which it was thrown or dropped. (If the wielder throws the stone at a target and misses, treat the stone as a splash weapon to determine where it lands.) Each creature that is not the target in the area where a pit is created in this way must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to jump to safety in the nearest open space. The pit disappears after 6 rounds. The stone is consumed upon being thrown or dropped.

# Anuli
Khopesh.COPY=Blade of Life's Defense																																																												COST:170	WT:6																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.7																	DESCISPI:YES		DESC:.CLEAR			DESC:This khopesh has a silver blade polished to an almost blinding sheen and etched with motifs of vines and leaves. Blades of life's defense can be bought in Anuli's Sword Alley, and are becoming more popular as rumblings of an open war with Geb continue to grow ever louder. Each blade is imbued with a shimmer of nonmagical might against undead that grants the blade's bearer a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws against the abilities of undead. It is otherwise treated as a standard khopesh.

# Cassomir
Heavy Mace (Base).COPY=Waterblight Scepter			KEY:Waterblight Scepter			SORTKEY:Waterblight Scepter																																										COST:12		WT:8																								EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|10000.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Bane ~ Weapon|Water Outsider Bane.Material ~ Steel																				SOURCEPAGE:p.9																	DESCISPI:YES		DESC:.CLEAR			DESC:This gnarled blackwood scepter seeps tar, making it sticky to the touch. Around Cassomir, waterblight scepters are popular among inquisitors, oracles, and witches who regularly ply the Sellen River or the waters of the Inner Sea as members of merchant caravans, pirate crews, or pirate hunters. The scepter acts as a +1 water-outsider-bane heavy mace. When the scepter is wielded against creatures with the water subtype, damage dealt by the scepter also ignores 10 points of DR. Additionally, the wielder can use water walk once per day for 90 minutes. The duration of this ability need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 10-minute increments.																									VISIBLE:YES

Baston fighting sticks vary in length from 2 to 4 feet, with thicknesses varying between 1 to 3 inches. In most applications, these weapons are similar to clubs or quarterstaffs, but in the hands of a trained expert, they truly shine.

The unique shape and craft of these bows allows them to shoot with the same velocity and power as a longbow. The shorter size also allows them to be wielded easily while mounted on horseback (or atop any other steed). While mounted, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls with a reflex bow. All reflex bows are composite bows and can be modified to benefit from high Strength scores in the same way as composite bows. Effects that apply to both longbows and shortbows also apply to reflex bows.

Technomagical internal mechanisms help the blade strike true when it would otherwise deliver a glancing blow. Once per day, when the wielder deals sneak attack or precision damage with this weapon, she can reroll the sneak attack or precision damage dice after the damage is rolled, but before the damage is applied. When the damage dice are rerolled with this ability, they are reduced by one step (for example, d6s become d4s, and d8s become d6s).												VISIBLE:YES

Further, the wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks to intuit that a creature is concealing its true beliefs, feelings, or motives.

Once per day as an immediate action when the wielder unsuccessfully attacks, he can activate the dagger to disappear in a whirlwind of black sand. The wielder teleports as per dimension door to any unoccupied square within 30 feet and can attempt a Stealth check to hide as if he were not being observed. The wielder cannot take any other creatures with him when he activates the dagger. Activating the dagger does not provoke attacks of opportunity.																									VISIBLE:YES
Scimitar (Base).COPY=Emerald-Eyed Blade				KEY:Emerald-Eyed Blade				SORTKEY:Emerald-Eyed Blade																																									COST:15		WT:4																								EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|6000.Special Ability ~ +3 ~ Weapon.Material ~ Steel																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.17																						DESC:.CLEAR			DESC:This +3 scimitar has an emerald gem set into its hilt.

Additionally, a horse wearing poh armor deals 2d6 points of damage to any foe it knocks prone when using an overrun combat maneuver. Poh armor otherwise functions like barding																														VISIBLE:YES

Each creature touching the ground in this space when this effect activates must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or fall prone. For the next 5 minutes, the bilgewater replicates the effects of grease in that square, and any creatures that move through it, including the wearer of the coat, must attempt Acrobatics checks as the grease spell requires.
