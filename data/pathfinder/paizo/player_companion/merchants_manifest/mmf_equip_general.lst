# Absalom
Badger Plush								TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:45		WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.4																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:This stuffed badger - a well-loved and legally protected animal in Absalom - is realistic enough to fool most other animals into thinking it is real. As a move action, a wielder can use a free hand to present the plush; any Small or smaller animal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that can see it takes a -2 on initiative checks.
Clockwork Dial								TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:150	WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.4																																	DESC:This brass timepiece can be wound with a small key, causing it to count down until it reaches the end of its duration, at which point it emits a small chime. Most dials have a maximum duration of 60 minutes, with each turn of a key adding 10 minutes, though some are crafted with longer or shorter durations and intervals.
Wasp Metheglin								TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Consumable																				COST:400	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.4																																	DESC:A rare breed of wasp produces the honey used to make this spiced, mead-like drink. For 1 hour after consuming a glass of wasp metheglin (this takes 1 round), the drinker is quick to respond to harm, gaining a +1 alchemical bonus on attack rolls against any creature that has damaged her with an attack within the previous round. This bonus does not stack with itself. A typical bottle holds four glasses' worth of metheglin.
Commissioned Broadsheet (Setup)				TYPE:Service																										COST:50				SOURCEPAGE:p.5																																	DESC:It takes 2 to 4 weeks for printers reproducing large images or those who have only engraved-plate printing presses to prepare the plate for a commissioned broadsheet. Printers with movable-type printing presses can prepare a text-only broadsheet in as little as 4 hours. 
Commissioned Broadsheet (Print Run/Per Day)	TYPE:Service																										COST:150			SOURCEPAGE:p.5																																	DESC:Once the setup is complete (which includes a proof print), the printer can produce up to 500 copies of the broadsheet daily (about 60 per hour). A commissioned broadsheet can be used to spread a rumor requiring the author to attempt any necessary skill checks. The author takes a –8 penalty on these checks because the broadsheet cannot provide vocal or nonverbal cues, but if he's successful, spreading the rumor takes only 1d4 days (or 1 day, if smaller than a small town). If the broadsheets are delivered by trained criers or others attempting to spread the rumor, use the propaganda check result of either the author or the crier (whichever is higher) with a +2 bonus.
Untrained Crier		KEY:Hireling (Untrained Crier)		OUTPUTNAME:Untrained Crier		TYPE:Service															COST:0.3			SOURCEPAGE:p.5																																	DESC:A crier can be hired to spread a rumor. An untrained crier usually has a +0 bonus on propaganda checks. If they are available, multiple criers can be hired to spread a single rumor; they attempt a single propaganda check together and gain a +1 bonus for every doubling of their numbers (+1 for two, +2 for four, +3 for eight, +4 for 16, or a maximum of +5 for 32 criers).
Trained Crier		KEY:Hireling (Trained Crier)		OUTPUTNAME:Trained Crier		TYPE:Service															COST:1				SOURCEPAGE:p.5																																	DESC:A crier can be hired to spread a rumor. A trained crier usually has a +5 bonus on propaganda checks. If they are available, multiple criers can be hired to spread a single rumor; they attempt a single propaganda check together and gain a +1 bonus for every doubling of their numbers (+1 for two, +2 for four, +3 for eight, +4 for 16, or a maximum of +5 for 32 criers).
Skilled Crier		KEY:Hireling (Skilled Crier)		OUTPUTNAME:Skilled Crier		TYPE:Service															COST:3				SOURCEPAGE:p.5																																	DESC:A crier can be hired to spread a rumor. A skilled crier usually has a +10 bonus on propaganda checks. If they are available, multiple criers can be hired to spread a single rumor; they attempt a single propaganda check together and gain a +1 bonus for every doubling of their numbers (+1 for two, +2 for four, +3 for eight, +4 for 16, or a maximum of +5 for 32 criers).
Masterful Crier		KEY:Hireling (Masterful Crier)		OUTPUTNAME:Masterful Crier		TYPE:Service															COST:10				SOURCEPAGE:p.5																																	DESC:A crier can be hired to spread a rumor. A masterful crier is rare and usually has a +12 bonus on propaganda checks. If they are available, multiple criers can be hired to spread a single rumor; they attempt a single propaganda check together and gain a +1 bonus for every doubling of their numbers (+1 for two, +2 for four, +3 for eight, +4 for 16, or a maximum of +5 for 32 criers).

# Aelyosos
Lonoma Eel									TYPE:Goods.Food.Consumable																							COST:1		WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Every spring, the waters south of Iblydos fill with the newly hatched young of the archipelago's immense lonoma eels, which fishermen harvest and brine to preserve for year-round consumption. Traditionally consumed as sailors' meals before long voyages to regain one's sea legs, lonoma eel grants a +2 competence bonus on concentration checks required for vigorous or violent motion for 8 hours.
Mekainae									TYPE:Goods.Food.Consumable																							COST:5		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Honey collectors harvest the immense combs created by the giant bees in the foothills of Pol-Ptirmeios. Local confectioners ferment this honey for several weeks before mixing it with flour and spices and cutting it into chewy cubes. Once reserved for hero-gods to enhance their longevity, mekainae is now served as a rare treat on important anniversaries and birthdays. Eating a serving of mekainae limits the reduction in a creature's current and total hit points to only 3 for each negative level it has (instead of the normal 5-point reduction in current and total hit points); other penalties imposed by negative levels remain unchanged. Additionally, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws to remove negative levels. Both effects last 24 hours.
Sylirican Lemons							TYPE:Goods.Food.Consumable																							COST:1		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																																	DESC:Sylirican lemons make prized preserves when ground, salted, and sealed in jars, adding an intense citrus flavor when sprinkled atop other foods. If, within 8 hours of consuming a meal seasoned with Sylirican lemons, you gain the confused condition, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the result from the result of your d%% roll to determine what action you take for the first round in which you are confused. This benefit does not stack with itself. The price and weight listed represent a jar containing enough preserved lemons to season 10 meals.
Remora Pad									TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable																					COST:5		WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																																	DESC:This foot-long strip of double-sided alchemical adhesive is sealed with waxed paper. When unsealed (this requires a move action) and pressed between two surfaces (this also requires a move action), a remora pad creates a firm and waterproof bond between two creatures or objects for up to 24 hours. If two creatures connect themselves in this way, both gain the grappled condition. However, if they are different size categories, only the smaller creature gains this condition. This bond survives light buffeting and movement, such as that created by incoming tides or by one attached surface dragging the other along underwater. Sharp tugs can break theseal fairly easily, and a willingly attached creature can pull free of the pad with a successful DC 5 Strength check as a standard action (DC 10 as a swift action). This weakness makes remora pads fairly ineffective when attempting to grapple a target, though a grappling creature that sticks itself to a target with a remora pad receives a +6 circumstance bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks to sustain the grapple in subsequent rounds (instead of the normal +5 bonus). A remora pad's bond is strong enough to support 200 pounds of material, so bonding two heavier objects together requires multiple pads. Underwater travelers often use remora pads to attach themselves to trained aquatic animals for long journeys.
Siphon Ray									TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:25		WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																																	DESC:This parasitic, hand-sized, cartilaginous fish attaches to a creature and filters nutrients directly from its host's bloodstream. However, a siphon ray reoxygenates the blood in the process, allowing the host to hold her breath for twice as long while underwater. A siphon ray must be attached for at least 1 minute before providing this benefit, and every hour a ray remains attached per day, the host must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or become fatigued. While attached, a siphon ray avoids most attacks as though it were a piece of equipment unless specifically targeted. A siphon ray must be kept in at least 1 gallon of salt water when not in use. If it is out of salt water for 1 hour, the siphon ray expires.

# Anuli
Anulite Paprika								TYPE:Goods.Food.Consumable																							COST:3		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.7																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Although Anulites make great use of foreign spices, Anulite paprika is perhaps the most popular in the city, especially among the wealthy. This bright red seasoning is used in all manner of seafood and vegetable dishes, imparting the heat greatly treasured in Anulite cuisine. Consuming a meal seasoned with Anulite paprika grants you some resistance against flames, reducing the amount of damage taken each round when you have caught on fire by 1. This benefit lasts for 8 hours and does not stack with itself. The price and weight listed represent a jar containing enough paprika to season 10 meals.

# Caliphas
Sangwine									TYPE:Goods.Food.Consumable																							COST:200	WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:This deep red wine is highly tannic and has notes of currants and cocoa and an aroma of cedar. Sangwine is a favorite of Caliphas's elite, who associate drinking it with long life. Drinking a glass of sangwine takes at least 1 round, though many imbibers take longer to savor the wine's complex flavors. After drinking a glass, the wine gives the drinker's blood a bitter flavor for 1 hour, causing any creature that deals damage using the blood drain extraordinary ability to become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the points of Constitution damage dealt (this effect is not subject to the poison immunity of vampires and other undead). Repeated uses of the blood drain ability on a creature that has imbibed at least one glass of sangwine extends the duration of the sickened condition. The price listed is for a bottle, which contains six glasses' worth of sangwine.

# Cassomir
Blackwood Figurehead						TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:650	WT:25	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																																	DESC:Carved in the likeness of a sea creature or another form desired by the one commissioning it, this item grants its ship's crew a +2 morale bonus on Profession (sailor) checks while on board.
Bogwalking Sandals							TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:250	WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:These sandals have blackwood soles and leather straps that wrap around the wearer's feet. The sandals are waterproof and are thus popular among individuals who tread the harsh locales of the swamps and wastelands beyond Cassomir proper - especially those who are in such environments for long periods of time without access to the comforts of a skilled cobbler. The sandals' design also allows the wearer to move through shallow bogs normally and to treat deep bogs as if they were shallow bogs. The sandals do not affect the penalty on Acrobatics checks while in bogs, and creatures wearing the sandals cannot gain cover from deep bogs.

# Goka
Poison, Might Blight	KEY:Poison (Might Blight)	SORTKEY:Poison, Might Blight	OUTPUTNAME:Might Blight		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable					COST:60		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	QUALITY:Plural|No	SPROP:Injury; Fort DC 13; Onset 1 rnd; Freq 1 rnd (4); Effect 1 Str dmg; Cure 2 consecutive saves		INFO:Poison Type|poison, injury	INFO:Poison Save|Fortitude DC 13	INFO:Poison Onset|1 round.	INFO:Poison Frequency|1/round for 4 rounds	INFO:Poison Effect|1 Str damage	INFO:Poison Cure|2 consecutive saves		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:The ratfolk of Diguo-Dashu, the “Empire of the Rats,” developed this poison to help their soldiers in overtaking foes. The poison produces lactic acids that slowly degrade the target's muscles, though for full efficacy, an exceptionally high dosage, repeated application, or a particularly feeble opponent is required.

# Kalsgard
Heated Gloves								TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable																					COST:2		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.13																																	DESC:These thick, fur-lined gloves have several internal pockets containing segmented packets of alchemical reagents that produce heat for 4 hours when broken and mixed. The wearer can massage the gloves to activate these heat packets as a full-round action. While the heat packets last, the wearer ignores the Strength and Dexterity penalties from the fatigued condition when performing Climb, Disable Device, and Sleight of Hand checks. Replacement heat packets cost 1 gp, and the heat packets in the gloves can be replaced with 1 minute of uninterrupted work.
Heat Packets								TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable																					COST:1		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.13																																	DESC:These alchemical packets can be used in heated gloves.

# Katheer
Heatstone									TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable																					COST:20		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.16																																	DESC:Alchemically treated to enhance their natural heat-generating properties, these round or ovoid stones of volcanic glass provide enough heat to keep chambers warm in the coldest winter. One heatstone keeps a 20-foot-square area comfortably warm even in extreme cold (below –20° F), or a 40-foot-square area in severe cold (between 0° F and –20° F). A single heatstone is activated by striking it against any hard surface, after which point it continues to provide heat for 24 hours. An active heatstone does not give off enough heat to cook food or cause damage.
Clockwork Oar								TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:500	WT:50	SOURCEPAGE:p.16																																	DESC:This clockwork device is powered by heatstones and seawater and can turn a ship's oar with tireless mechanical strokes. When installed on a water vehicle that uses muscle as a means of propulsion, a clockwork oar performs the function of one Medium rower. A broken clockwork oar functions only half as well as an unbroken one, so two broken clockwork oars are required to perform the function of one Medium rower. For driving checks with a water vehicle powered with only clockwork oars, the driver must attempt Disable Device or Knowledge (engineering) checks instead of the skill checks listed in the vehicle's driving check entry in its stat block. (These checks represent the sailor ensuring that all of the oars are moving in unison and without impediment.) If a water vehicle is powered with one or more clockwork oars but not solely with clockwork oars, the skills used for driving checks remain unchanged.
Heatstone Desalinator						TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:10		WT:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.16																																	DESC:Most desalination equipment is rare, slow, and energy-intensive enough that magic is the preferred method for turning salt water into fresh drinking water. The power provided by this device's heatstones accelerates the desalination process considerably. The user of a heatstone desalinator can place 1 gallon of salt water into the device and receive a gallon of fresh water in 1 minute, with no additional effort required on her own part.
Reagent Extractor							TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:1000	WT:10	SOURCEPAGE:p.17																																	DESC:These connected glass-and-copper apparatuses have heatstones and other components installed at the base of each container to break down magic liquids placed within. Any potion placed within the extractor is distilled down to its component parts over the course of 4 hours; this destroys the potion. The extracted essences can then be used to brew a new potion as long as the new potion is of the same spell level or lower than the distilled potion. Using the extractor in this way does not change the requirements for brewing a potion, but it does remove the need to use fresh and unused ingredients and materials to brew the new potion, and this waives the new potion's base cost (but not the requirement to provide any costly material component or focus that the new potion's spell requires). Essences extracted from a potion using a reagent extractor must be used to create a new potion within 24 hours; after this time, they become inert.

# Kibwe
Darkwood Ancestry Plank						TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:10		WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.20		EQMOD:Material ~ Blackwood																			DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Ancestor worship is common among the peoples of the Mwangi Expanse, and many display wooden planks in their homes that contain depictions of enormous trees with the names of their ancestors carved onto branches. Ancestry planks made of darkwood are much lighter and smaller than their conventional counterparts, which make them appealing to Mwangi adventurers looking to honor their lineages while venturing away from home. Many from the Mwangi Expanse recognize the difficulty in obtaining darkwood and view those who carry darkwood ancestry planks with respect.
Harp (Base).COPY=Darkwood Mwangi Harp		NAMEISPI:YES	KEY:Harp (Darkwood Mwangi) 																			COST:130	WT:1.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.20		EQMOD:Material ~ Blackwood.Special Quality ~ Masterwork ~ Item										DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Musicians in the Mwangi Expanse make frequent use of carved harps strung with strings made from natural materials. These harps often feature ornately detailed soundboards and necks shaped like creatures that inhabit the region. Harps crafted from darkwood are very light compared to similar instruments, yet they retain the resonance and tonal quality demanded by the pickiest of musicians. A darkwood Mwangi harp is a masterwork musical instrument that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks when using it.																BONUS:SKILL|Perform (String Instruments)|2|TYPE=Circumstance

# Magnimar
Celwynvian Stone Fruit		NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Goods.Food.Consumable																							COST:500	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.21																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:This bizarre fruit appears to be carved from stone, though it has a lovely aroma and is easily consumed. Stone fruits occasionally sprout from the strange treelike monument known as the Celwynvian Charge, where they are gathered by licensed vendors and sold to travelers. Eating a stone fruit hardens flesh and restores vitality. When a creature eats the fruit as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, it immediately recovers 2d6 hit points and gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor for 1 minute.
Charda Claws				NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:150	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.21		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Uses per Day / 1|CHARGES[1]													DESCISPI:YES			DESC:This tiny set of sculpted claws, made from stone carefully chipped from the Battle of Charda monument, is set upon a fine chain. Once per day when attempting an Intimidate check to demoralize a single opponent in combat, the user can forcefully present the charda claws as part of the action to activate their residual power. Using the claws in this way requires a free hand, but only while the Intimidate check is made. If the Intimidate check was a success and the target is demoralized, the claws grant the wielder a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against that creature for the duration of the demoralized effect. If the wielder uses the claws but the Intimidate check is not successful, the claws' daily use is expended to no effect.
Covenant Rings								TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:100	WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.21																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:These silver rings are always sold in uniquely crafted pairs - usually one made in a Varisian style and one in an old Korvosan style. Originally made to celebrate the uniting of the Korvosan dissidents and Varisian locals at the city's outset, they are now commonly sought by young lovers, very close friends, and other intimate pairs. When two emotionally intimate creatures each wear one of the rings in a set, both wearers gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This bonus ends if the creatures' emotional bond is severed (at the GM's discretion), one of the creatures removes a ring and returns it to the other creature, or a bonded creature is no longer wearing the ring (or is no longer alive or on the same plane).
Founderflame Torch			NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:250	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.21																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:One end of this short length of petrified wood burns with a flame of ever-changing hue, a tiny portion of the fires of the Founder's Flame. It provides light as per a normal torch but is not consumed, and its fire cannot be extinguished by mundane means (though total immersion temporarily quenches the flame). The torch can be wielded as an improvised light mace that deals an additional 1d2 points of fire damage; in addition, a creature damaged by the torch's fire takes a –1 penalty on saving throws for 1 round against effects that deal fire damage.

# Ordu-Aganhei
Mantra Wheel								TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:450	WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.23																																	DESC:This handheld metal cylinder is embossed with traditional symbols tied to protectiveness and has a handle that can be used to spin it. Mantra wheels are often used by divine spellcasters who are blind or have difficulty with fine gestures, or who simply enjoy using this traditional device. As a move action, a scroll of a divine spell can be placed inside the wheel. The handle is then spun, activating the scroll without the use of verbal or somatic components. If the wheel's user would need to attempt a caster level check to activate the scroll successfully, the wheel provides a +3 bonus on that check. Spinning the wheel is part of the normal action required to activate the scroll (usually a standard action or the spell's casting time, whichever is longer). Using the wheel to activate a scroll provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as activating a scroll (or casting the spell) normally would. The wheel can hold only one divine scroll at a time. Removing an expended scroll from a mantra wheel is a swift action.
Monkey Statue								TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:150	WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.23																																	DESC:For some unknown reason, this finely crafted but mundane monkey statue repulses oni. Any creature with the oni subtype that is within 30 feet of a monkey statue takes a –1 penalty on all d20 rolls. The monkey statue can be unattended or presented by its wielder as a swift action to cause this effect; the statue has no effect on oni if it is simply stored on a wielder's person. A wielder must have a free hand available to present the statue and gain its effect. This penalty does not stack with that from other monkey statues.
Spirit Offering								TYPE:Goods.General.Consumable																						COST:20		WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.23																																	DESC:These offerings take many forms, such as food, incense, pinwheels, rare teas, perfectly smooth white pebbles, or stone tablets, but they are always kept in pouches tied with ribbon. Travelers leave these offerings at the small shrines or holy sites that can be found scattered along roads. For 1 hour after a traveler leaves a spirit offering, any kami the traveler encounters has its initial attitude improved by one step. This attitude adjustment reverts to normal after 10 minutes unless the creature's attitude is adjusted further during that time, such as via the Diplomacy skill, in which case the kami's attitude does not revert after the offering's effect expires. Once a spirit offering has been used to improved a kami's attitude, it cannot be reused.
Horse Whip									TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:5		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.24																																	DESC:A short whip with a leather loop at the end, this whip can be felt through a horse's armor but does not deal damage to the horse. A rider who uses a horse whip while using the Ride skill to spur her mount does not deal damage to the mount, as opposed to the 1d3 points of damage normally dealt by this action. Using a horse whip does not negate the fatigue that spurring a mount can cause.

# Senghor
Candlefish									TYPE:Goods.Food.Consumable.Light Source																				COST:0.7	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.26																																	DESC:This long, oily, salted fish comes strung on a wick similar to that found in a candle. The fish can be cooked and eaten as a tasty trail ration, with the listed price buying a fish big enough for one day's worth of food for a single creature. As long as the fish stays dry, it can go for months without spoiling. Sections of the candlefish can also be burned as a candle. One day's worth of candlefish is equivalent to six candles. Once used as a candle, a candlefish can no longer be eaten.
Warka Jar									TYPE:Goods.General																									COST:2		WT:.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.26																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:This 2-foot-tall, vase-shaped object is inspired by the huge warka towers found in inland areas of Senghor and other parts of the Mwangi Expanse. The warka jar is made of lightweight and elastic juncus stalks woven into a crisscross pattern. A fine mesh hangs inside and collects water condensation. Placing a warka jar outside overnight collects enough fresh water for a single creature to survive for one day. When not in use, the warka jar can be collapsed into a pocket-sized cube for easy transportation.

# Ular Kel
Dragon's Blend Coffee (Cup)					TYPE:Goods.Liquid.Food.Consumable																					COST:1		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.27																																	DESC:This aromatic blend fills the belly with the sensation of fire, warming the drinker's body. By drinking two cups of dragon's blend coffee, you gain cold resistance 5 for 1 hour. Once the coffee has prevented 5 points of cold damage, the effect ends. You can benefit from dragon's blend coffee only once per day.
Karazhica Coffee (Cup)						TYPE:Goods.Liquid.Food.Consumable																					COST:1		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.27																											DESCISPI:YES			DESC:The gold standard of coffee in Ular Kel, Karazhica is notable for its acidity and smooth flavor. By drinking two cups of Karazhica coffee, you can walk for an additional hour before you must make a forced march. This additional hour counts as an hour of marching beyond the maximum for the purpose of determining the DC of Constitution checks for a subsequent forced march. You can benefit from Karazhica coffee only once per day.
Yenchaburian Hybrid Coffee (Cup)			TYPE:Goods.Liquid.Food.Consumable																					COST:1		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.27																																	DESC:This bitter coffee cultivar increases the drinker's alertness to nearby threats. For 1 hour after drinking two cups of Yenchaburian hybrid coffee, you gain a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice a creature that is using Stealth. You can benefit from yenchaburian hybrid coffee only once per day.
