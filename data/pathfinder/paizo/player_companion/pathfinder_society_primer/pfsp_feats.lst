# Feats
Improved Day Job			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	TYPE:General	DESC:You learned the importance of an honest day's work while training as an initiate of the Pathfinder Society.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to attempt Day Job checks (see the Guide to Pathfinder Society Organized Play).	BENEFIT You gain a +3 bonus on Day Job checks using one skill you choose when you take this feat. This bonus stacks with other feats that grant a bonus to the chosen skill, including Skill Focus.
Patient Strike			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	TYPE:Combat	DESC:Your training under the Master of Swords has taught you that a well-timed strike is worth waiting for and that patience will serve you well in the long run.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Int 13.	PRESTAT:1,INT=13	BENEFIT:You can choose to ready an attack as a fullround action instead of a standard action. When you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll when your readied action triggers. Normal: Readying an attack is a standard action and doesn't grant a bonus on your attack roll.
Steadfast Mind			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	TYPE:General	DESC:You can concentrate even in the direst circumstances, and know how to retain your magic even when it would otherwise be wasted.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Cha 15, Int 15, or Wis 15 (see special).	PRESTAT:1,CHA=15,INT=15,WIS=15	BENEFIT:Whenever you fail a concentration check while casting defensively and would normally lose a prepared spell or spell slot, you may attempt a Will save (DC = 15 + spell level) to retain the spell as though you had not attempted to cast it. The failed concentration check still results in the spell's failure, even if the spell is retained. Special: To gain the benef its of this feat, you must meet the prerequisite that matches the ability score you use to determine your save DCs, bonus spells per day, and ability to cast spells of a given level. If you gain spells from multiple classes, you must meet the prerequisite ability score for each class to gain the benef its of this feat when casting spells from that class's spell list.

Quick Preparation			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	TYPE:General	DESC:Early on in your adventuring career, you learned (perhaps the hard way) how to prepare your spells even when put under extreme time constraints.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to prepare spells.	BENEFIT:When preparing spells, you halve the time necessary to do so. Normal: Preparing all of your spells takes 1 hour.
Renown				CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	TYPE:General	DESC:Word of your pre-Pathf inder accomplishments precedes you, and you know how to make the most of your previous reputation.	BENEFIT: When in a settlement of 5,000 people or more, treat your Fame score as 2 higher for the purposes of qualifying for Prestige Awards or purchasing equipment. This feat doesn’t grant you any additional Prestige Points. Normal: Your Fame score is determined by the total number of Prestige Points earned over the course of your career.
Versatile Spontaneity		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	TYPE:General	DESC:You made a good name for yourself in the Pathf inder Society in part because you knew how to prepare for the challenges before you, even if your natural magical abilities lend themselves less to preparation and more to spontaneity.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Int 13 or Wis 13 (see Special), ability to spontaneously cast 2nd-level spells.	PRESTAT:1,INT=13,WIS=13	BENEFIT: When you regain spell slots at the start of the day, you may opt to prepare one spell you don’t know in place of a daily spell slot 1 level higher than the prepared spell’s level. To do so, you must have access to the selected spell on a scroll or in a spellbook, and the spell must be on your spell list (even if it is not one of your spells known). This process takes 10 minutes per spell level of the selected spell. You can cast the selected spell a single time, expending the spell slot as though it were a known spell being cast by you. Preparing a spell in this manner expends a scroll but not a spellbook. A spell prepared in this way is considered its actual level rather than the level of the spell slot expended. You can apply metamagic feats to the spell as normal, as long as the spell’s actual level plus the increases from metamagic feats is 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. For example, a 12th-level sorcerer with this feat, a scroll of fireball, and the Empower Spell metamagic feat could prepare an empowered fireball spell in her 6th-level spell slot. Special: If you spontaneously cast arcane spells, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 13 to take this feat. If you spontaneously cast divine spells, you must have a Wisdom score of at least 13 to take this feat. If you have both arcane and divine spellcasting classes, you can use this feat to prepare a spell using a given class’s spell slot as long as you meet the associated ability score prerequisite.

Collective Recollection		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	TYPE:Teamwork	DESC:You and your allies can quickly jog each other's memories to remember essential facts.	BENEFIT:When an ally who also has this feat attempts a trained Knowledge skill check while within 30 feet of you, you may attempt an aid another check as a free action to improve that ally's skill check. You must have at least 1 rank in the Knowledge skill to be aided in order to use this feat. If you succeed at the aid another check, you automatically know any information your ally gains from the Knowledge check as if you had rolled the Knowledge check. Whether or not your aid another check is successful, you cannot attempt a Knowledge check to determine the same information as your ally after using this feat.
Esoteric Advantage		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	TYPE:General	DESC:You're able to discern subtle and ineffable flaws in a creature's defenses.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Knowledge (arcana, dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks.	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=3,Knowledge (dungeoneering)=3,Knowledge (local)=3,Knowledge (nature)=3,Knowledge (planes)=3,Knowledge (religion)=3	BENEFIT:After identifying an individual creature with a successful Knowledge skill check, you can spend a move action to adapt your tactics to reduce that individual's natural defenses. Choose one of the following abilities that you identified: damage reduction, energy resistance, or spell resistance. For the next 24 hours you treat the selected ability as if it were 2 lower, to a minimum of 0 (for instance, you would treat DR 5/magic as if it were DR 3/magic). You can only benefit from this feat against one single creature at a time. If you use this feat to adapt your tactics to another individual before 24 hours have passed since you last adapted to a creature, the benefit provided against the first individual ends and is replaced by the benefit against the second individual. You can switch which identified creature you have adapted your tactics to (including which special ability you wish to treat as lower) as a move action.
Uncanny Activation		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	TYPE:General	DESC:You can coax greater power out of magical devices.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Use Magic Device 12 ranks.	PRESKILL:1,Use Magic Device=12	BENEFIT:If you exceed the Use Magic Device DC to activate a spell completion or spell trigger item by 5 or more, you can increase the item's caster level by 1 for determining the spell's effect. Alternatively, if you exceed the Use Magic Device DC by 10 or more when activating a magic item with charges, you can expend an additional charge to increase the caster level by 2 levels. Regardless, you can't increase an item's caster level to one that is higher than your own caster level.

Emergency Attunement		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:General	DESC:You can adapt your defenses to any situation.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Spellcraft 7 ranks.	PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=7	BENEFIT: As a standard action, you can alter one of your ongoing abjuration or transmutation spells. It must be currently affecting you and must grant a choice of options when cast. You change its benefit to a different one from the same list. In order to accomplish this, you must make a successful Spellcraft check (DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell to be altered). The duration of the spell is reduced to half of the spell’s remaining duration. For example, a 7thlevel wizard could change her resist energy ( fire) spell with 50 minutes of its duration remaining into resist energy (cold), but the new duration would be 25 minutes. This ability does not change the benefit for any other creatures targeted by the original spell.
Planned Spontaneity		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.WizardBonus	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Arcana)=9	PRESPELLCAST:MEMORIZE=Y	PRESPELLTYPE:1,ANY=4	DESC:You have a measure of flexibility when preparing spells.	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	BENEFIT:Once per day when you prepare spells, you can designate one spell slot from each of up to three different spell levels that are lower than the highest-level spell that you can cast. In each designated slot you can memorize two different spells of the respective level. You can cast either spell as normal, but when you do, the spell consumes both of the spells prepared in that spell slot.
Tapestry Traveler			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:General	DESC:Your many visits to the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane have made you an expert in long-distance travel.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Character level 5th.	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=5	BENEFIT:You cast spells of the teleportation subschool as though your caster level were 2 higher, and you treat yourself as one step more familiar when teleporting to an established Pathfinder lodge with the teleport spell. If you can teleport as a supernatural ability, you treat your class level as if it were 2 higher when calculating the total distance that you can travel with this ability.

Cut Your Losses			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:General		DESC:You realize that sometimes it’s a safer bet to simply get out of danger’s way as fast as possible. You are able to summon a surge of adrenaline when you grab what is most dear to you and run.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 13, Acrobatics 1 rank.	PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=1	BENEFIT:Whenever you withdraw as a full-round action and have at least one free hand, you can pick up one unattended object or unconscious ally of your size or smaller at any point during your movement without provoking attacks of opportunity. Any additional movement performed on your turn still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. In addition, you treat your Strength score as 2 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity.
Improved Underhanded Teamwork	CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:Combat.Teamwork	DESC:You and your allies have trained together long enough to know how to exploit an opponent’s disadvantage to make her predicament even worse.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Combat Expertise, Improved Dirty Trick, Underhanded Teamwork, base attack bonus +6.	PRETOTALAB:6	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=Feat,Combat Expertise,Improved Dirty Trick,Underhanded Teamwork	BENEFIT: Whenever an ally who also has this feat performs the dirty trick combat maneuver against a foe that you both threaten, you may attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the same foe as an immediate action to inf lict a second condition. If the foe uses an action to remove the f irst condition, it also removes the condition imposed by your immediate action.
Underhanded Teamwork		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:Combat.Teamwork	DESC:You and your allies know how to use coordinated maneuvers to set up an enemy with an unfair disadvantage.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Combat Expertise, Improved Dirty Trick.	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Feat,Combat Expertise,Improved Dirty Trick	BENEFIT: Whenever an ally who also has this feat performs a dirty trick combat maneuver against a foe you both threaten, you can use an immediate action to increase the inflicted condition’s duration by 1 round.
