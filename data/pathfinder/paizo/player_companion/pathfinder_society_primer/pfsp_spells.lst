If the ally is the target of two instances of this spell, she can instead apply the Empower Spell meta magic feat to a spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. Finally, if three of this spell are affecting her when casting a spell, she can instead apply the Maximize Spell or Widen Spell metamagic feat to a spell at least 3 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. You can't target yourself with collaborative thaumaturgy.
