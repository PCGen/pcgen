# Relic Master
Class Skills		KEY:Relic Master ~ Class Skills			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Relic Master Class Feature.Fighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:The relic master receives Knowledge (arcana) and Use Magic Device as class skills, but doesn't receive Handle Animal or Ride as class skills. This alters the fighter's class skills.																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.
Improved Item Mastery	KEY:Relic Master ~ Improved Item Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Relic Master Class Feature.Fighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, once per day, a relic master can use a item mastery feat she knows with a magic item that doesn't have an appropriate spell in its construction requirements. The magic item must meet all other requirements of the item mastery feat. Alternatively, if she is using a magic item with an appropriate spell in its construction requirements, she can use an item mastery feat without it counting against the feat's total uses per day. She can use this ability one additional time per day at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels. This ability replaces armor training.																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.
Relic Channeler		KEY:Relic Master ~ Relic Channeler			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Relic Master Class Feature.Fighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, a relic master can increase the potency of a magic item she wields by investing it with a bit of her vitality as a swift action. If the item is armor, a shield, or a weapon, its enhancement bonus increases by 1 to a maximum of +5. If the magic item creates a spell or has a save DC, its effective caster level increases by 1. A relic master can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to 1 + her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 minute). This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. This ability replaces weapon training.

Improvised Item Mastery	KEY:Relic Master ~ Improvised Item Mastery	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Relic Master Class Feature.Fighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 19th level as a fullround action, the relic master can select one item mastery feat whose prerequisites she meets but that she doesn't already have. She gains access to this feat, though she can't use it as a prerequisite for other feats or options. If she selects a different item mastery feat, she loses access to her previous use of improvised item mastery and any magic effect created with it ends immediately. Any daily uses of a selected improvised item mastery feat count against all improvised mastery feats selected in the same day. This ability replaces armor mastery.																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.
