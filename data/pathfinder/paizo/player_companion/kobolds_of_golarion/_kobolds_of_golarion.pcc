DESC:Traps, Tribes, and Tenacity! Dwelling underground in the dark and twisting sprawl of their tunnels, kobolds make unlikely heroes. Pathfinder Player Companion: Kobolds of Golarion unlocks the potential of this cunning and skilled race, showing how the talents kobolds have trained in since birth—trapmaking, teamwork, and sneakiness—make them excellent dungeon delvers. Unlike some of the less intelligent creatures that share the Darklands with them, kobolds make allies among the surface races and exert influence in many of Golarion’s cities. Though they’re limited within their rigid tribal rules, kobolds have the ambition of dragons!
