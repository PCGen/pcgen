# Spell Name				Type				Classes of caster												School			Descriptor						Components		Casting Time			Range			Target Area or Effect									Duration					Save Info						Spell Resistance	Source Page		Description
Heavy Water					TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Ranger=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Water					COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Cylinder of water ((CASTERLEVEL*5)-ft. radius, 30 ft. deep)	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None (see text)			SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You cause a volume of water to become heavier than normal. Swimming in such water requires a Swim check (DC same as this spell). Success allows a creature to swim at half its speed as a full-round action; one cannot swim as a move action in heavy water. If a creature fails its check by 4 or less, it makes no progress. If it fails by 5 or more, it goes underwater. Perception checks to see through the affected water take a -10 penalty. Ships sailing through the area move at half speed.
Hydrophobia					TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=3						SCHOOL:Necromancy		DESCRIPTOR:Emotion,Fear,Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:Targets in the area must succeed at a Will save or become deathly afraid of drowning. If the target is swimming or submerged in water, it must attempt to escape from the water. As long as an affected target remains in water, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round. Even out of water, targets cannot imbibe potions or willingly interact with any fluids for the duration of this spell.
Blood Boil					TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=5								SCHOOL:Necromancy									COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One living creature							DURATION:3 rounds				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:The temperature of the target's blood begins to rise over the next 3 rounds. Each round starting with the first, the target attempts a new saving throw at the start of the caster's turn. A successful save does not end the spell effect, but does prevent that round's effect. On the round that this spell is cast, the target becomes fatigued. On the next round, the target takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. On the third and final round, the spell deals (min(15,CASTERLEVEL))d6 points of damage, and the target becomes exhausted rather than fatigued.
Imbue with Addiction			TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Alchemist=2|Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=3							SCHOOL:Transmutation								COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One living creature							DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:The target immediately becomes addicted to the drug used as the material component during the casting of the spell. If the target was ever addicted to the drug at any point in the past, it takes a â€“4 penalty on its saving throw.
