A vessel of the failed intimately understands the shaky line between success and failure and embraces walking that line to gain power from the spirits he calls.

Will of the Failed					KEY:Vessel of the Failed ~ Will of the Failed										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.VesseloftheFailedClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																															DESC:A vessel of the failed is intimately familiar with the supernatural stubbornness of the brash heroes who have met their demise pursuing the Test of the Starstone, and he can tap into this strength when he needs it the most. When a spirit attains 5 or more points of influence over the vessel of the failed, the vessel can attempt a Will saving throw (DC %1) to avoid completely losing control to the spirit. The first time in a single 24-hour seance period that the vessel succeeds at this saving throw, he is deafened until he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. The second time the vessel succeeds at this saving throw during that period, he is also blinded. The third time, he is also staggered. These conditions are unavoidable and cannot be removed through magic or any other method. (If he wishes, the vessel of the failed can choose to forgo this saving throw and lose control to the spirit as normal.) The fourth time in a single seance period that a spirit gains 5 or more influence points over the vessel of the failed, the vessel must succeed at a Will save or he loses control to the spirit and effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. If a spirit ever attains 7 or more points of influence over the vessel, the vessel automatically loses control to the spirit and effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. A vessel of the failed cannot channel a weaker spirit. This alters spirit and spirit mastery.|15+(MediumLVL/2)	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Reckless Surge						KEY:Vessel of the Failed ~ Reckless Surge											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.VesseloftheFailedClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																DEFINE:RecklessSurgeDice|0		DEFINE:RecklessSurgeDie|0	DESC:A vessel of the failed can attempt to tap into his spirit's bravado-though harnessing such moxie is never guaranteed. If the vessel allows his spirit to gain 2 additional points of influence over him after failing a d20 roll that was modified by his spirit bonus, there is a 75%% chance (1-75 on a d%%) that he can add %1d%2 to the check's result without taking an action. However, there is a 25%% chance (76-100 on a d%%) that the vessel instead gains no bonus from this ability. The vessel of the failed must allow his spirit to gain the 2 points of influence over him before determining whether he receives any bonus. The vessel of the failed can use the spirit surge ability as normal. However, using reckless surge in the way described above always requires the vessel to allow his spirit to gain 2 additional points of influence over him, regardless of abilities that allow him to otherwise use spirit surge without incurring influence (such as taboo or spirit mastery). This alters spirit surge.|RecklessSurgeDice|RecklessSurgeDie																																																																						BONUS:VAR|RecklessSurgeDice|3	BONUS:VAR|RecklessSurgeDie|6	BONUS:VAR|RecklessSurgeDie|2|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,10	BONUS:VAR|RecklessSurgeDie|2|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,20												SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Heroic Exceptions					KEY:Vessel of the Failed ~ Heroic Exceptions										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.VesseloftheFailedClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																														DESC:Each time a vessel of the failed breaks a taboo he has accepted, he can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him. When he does so, the penalty he takes on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws changes from -2 to -1. This influence is in addition to the influence the spirit normally gains for breaking the taboo in the first place. If the vessel continues violating the taboo while taking a reduced penalty, the duration of the reduced penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the vessel. This alters taboo.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Spiritual Swan Song					KEY:Vessel of the Failed ~ Spiritual Swan Song										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.VesseloftheFailedClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																															DESC:When the circumstances are right, the vessel of the failed can become a conduit for his spirit's brush with divinity. Whenever the vessel makes a successful saving throw via the will of the failed ability to avoid completely losing control to his spirit, the vessel gains one use of a spell-like ability tied to the spirit's legend, as noted below. When he gains a use of a spell-like ability, the vessel of the failed can expend it anytime before his next seance. (A vessel might gain multiple uses of these spell-like abilities, depending on how many times he successfully saves to avoid losing control to a spirit.) However, if he loses contact with a spirit during that time, he also loses all uses of the spell-like ability gained from avoiding losing control to that spirit. If the vessel does not expend his uses of these abilities, they disappear when he loses contact with that spirit or when he starts a new seance, whichever comes first.	DESC:The vessel of the failed can cast chain lightning, freezing sphere, or sirocco APG as a spell-like ability. The vessel must choose which one when he gains a use of this ability. If he gains multiple uses of this ability in a single seance period, the vessel of the failed can make a different choice each time.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Archmage Spirit		DESC:The vessel of the failed can cast blade barrier as a spell-like ability.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Champion Spirit	DESC:The vessel of the failed can cast antimagic field as a spell-like ability.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Guardian Spirit		DESC:The vessel of the failed can cast mass cure moderate wounds or mass inflict moderate wounds as a spell-like ability. The vessel must choose which of these two he can use when he gains a use of this ability. If the vessel of the failed gains multiple uses of this ability in a single seance period, he can choose a different spell-like ability each time.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Hierophant Spirit		DESC:The vessel of the failed can cast greater heroism as a spell-like ability.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Marshal Spirit		DESC:The vessel of the failed can cast true seeing as a spell-like ability.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Trickster Spirit	SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Implements of the Palatine Eye		KEY:Esoteric Initiate ~ Implements of the Palatine Eye								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OccultistClassFeatures.EsotericInitiateClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																										DESCISPI:YES	DESC:An esoteric initiate has formed a supernatural bond with a set of the order's writings collected into a book. If the book is damaged, it is restored to full hit points when the initiate's mental focus refreshes. If the book is lost or destroyed, the initiate can replace it with another similar one, but doing so requires an 8-hour ritual that binds the new book to him. The book serves as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level. The initiate gains new implement schools normally. However, the initiate's additional implements must be masterwork or magic items worth at least 50 gp, and they must directly or nominally represent the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye's beliefs or history. For example, the initiate's implements could be Osirian antiques, trinkets covered in Palatine iconography, or the like. When the initiate benefits from his implements' resonant powers, he treats his occultist level as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the powers' benefits only. An esoteric initiate can't save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it.	DESC: When the initiate shifts his mental focus from one implement to another, he loses no focus when doing so.|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=4		DESC:This alters mental focus, implements, and shift focus.

Symbolism							KEY:Esoteric Initiate ~ Symbolism													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OccultistClassFeatures.EsotericInitiateClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																															DESC:An initiate who spends 1 minute carefully studying any written work can understand its gist even if he doesn't speak the language in which the text is written. %1 times per day, the initiate can cast comprehend languages (CL %1) as a spell-like ability to read a written work. If he uses symbolism to read a portion of the work that contains a hidden message or a cypher, he is automatically granted a Linguistics check with a +%1 bonus to decipher the message.|OccultistLvl																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.9

Anger								KEY:Seeker Emotional Focus ~ Anger													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Seeker Emotional Focus									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Spiritualist Archetype ~ Seeker of Enlightenment																																																																																																DESC:Phantoms with this emotional focus are filled with seething anger from events in their past lives. Phantoms with this focus often take the form of hulking brutes with furrowed brows or of frenzied creatures that always seem ready to strike down those who come too near. Many times, these phantoms exude a bright red aura, especially when they are engaged in combat, or they seem to breathe a red mist in shallow pants from behind clenched, phantasmal teeth.

It's often the case that a phantom with this emotional focus has a strong familial tie with its spiritualist master. A dedication phantom most often appears as a strong and stern protector with a watchful gaze, and its service to its spiritualist is unwavering. These spirits exude auras of blue, or sometimes rose if their love for their spiritualist masters in life was great. Many times these auras manifest as a halo, giving these phantoms a divine appearance, no matter their actual alignment or opinions on matters of religion.

Despair								KEY:Seeker Emotional Focus ~ Despair												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Seeker Emotional Focus									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Spiritualist Archetype ~ Seeker of Enlightenment																																																																																																DESC:Some creatures die in such horrific ways, or live such pointless and senseless lives, that despair grips their very beings. Phantoms with this focus use misery as a weapon, inf licting the living with the gloom of the phantoms' continued existence. Despair phantoms often appear twisted or wounded, showing the grisly circumstances of their demise. Their coloration tends to have a grayish or sickly green cast. When they speak, they do so in terrifying whispers or high-pitched screeches.

Fear								KEY:Seeker Emotional Focus ~ Fear													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Seeker Emotional Focus									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Spiritualist Archetype ~ Seeker of Enlightenment																																																																																																DESC:A phantom with this emotional focus suffered from overwhelming fear in life. As a phantom, it is able to channel that fear into a terrifying weapon. Fear phantoms are often horrifying to behold. Sometimes they appear as ghostly figures in tattered funeral garb or wrapped in chains or other bindings. Their features may be distorted into gaunt and haunting forms, making them seem more like ghosts or spectres. A miasma of livid gray swirling motes often surrounds their forms as they stalk their surroundings, seeking to bestow their terror on others.

Phantoms with this focus often are blinded by-and blind others with-this powerful emotion. These phantoms are frequently darker and more foreboding than all but those phantoms with the fear emotional focus. Many of them manifest as dark and dreadful knights, their armor bristling with spikes and their hands seeming to grasp barbed and terrible weapons. Other times they appear as tall, gaunt f igures staring down arrogantly at those who approach. These phantoms typically spew a string of curses at their foes, often profane, sometimes poetic. Their auras are pulsating and pitch black, and thrum violently when these horrible phantoms attack.

Jealousy							KEY:Seeker Emotional Focus ~ Jealousy												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Seeker Emotional Focus									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Spiritualist Archetype ~ Seeker of Enlightenment																																																																																																DESC:A phantom with this emotional focus is covetous of everything-its master, those who wish to do it harm, and any who do not pay attention to it. It demands to be the center of attention at all times. The forms these phantoms take are as diverse as the forms of jealousy in life. Often they take pleasing forms, wishing to draw others in. Other times they take the form of crawling and lurching things, grasping at all they covet when they come within reach. The auras of these needy phantoms quickly change in color, going from an oily green to orange, to brownish red as they swirl through emotions in their efforts to gain the objects of their dark desires.

Zeal								KEY:Seeker Emotional Focus ~ Zeal													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Seeker Emotional Focus									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Spiritualist Archetype ~ Seeker of Enlightenment																																																																																																DESC:A phantom with this emotional focus fixates on every task given as if it were the phantom's last. The most basic commands are treated as life-and-death situations, and the truly dangerous ones are faced with a resolve and tenacity that sometimes defies common sense. Zeal phantoms take the form of steadfast protectors or daring and manic creatures looking for the next challenge or opportunity to prove itself to either its master or itself. Often very prideful creatures, these phantoms display an orange aura upon completing their tasks. They are prone to boast about their accomplishments and chastise those around them for not accomplishing more.
