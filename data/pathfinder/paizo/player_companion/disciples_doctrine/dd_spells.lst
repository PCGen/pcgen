Debilitating Speech									TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4								SCHOOL:Enchantment								DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent,Mind-Affecting 				COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:see below				RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:Up to (CASTERLEVEL) living creatures, no two of which may be more than 30 feet apart		SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SOURCEPAGE:p.10		DESC:By speaking eloquently on the subject of your opponents' ineptitude in combat, past failures, personal hygiene, or other faults, you sap their will to fight. This spell can be cast as a standard action or as a full-round action. If cast as a standard action, it takes effect in 1d4 rounds following the spell's casting. If cast as a full-round action, it takes effect 1 round after its casting. Enemies with 4 Hit Dice or fewer are panicked, enemies with 5-8 Hit Dice are cowering, and enemies with more than 8 Hit Dice are shaken.
Fastidiousness										TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Paladin,Sorcerer,Wizard=1			SCHOOL:Abjuration																							COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:24 hours								SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:While protected by fastidiousness, your person and your equipment stay clean and dry. Dust and moisture slough off immediately; even when you are completely soiled, your appearance reverts to a pristine state over the course of 1 minute. While this spell offers no protection against most attacks, staying constantly sanitary grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against inhaled and ingested diseases.
Fortune's Path										TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3					SCHOOL:Divination																							COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:10 minutes				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:Instantaneous							SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.10		DESC:You predict events in your near future.

Hallucinatory Decor									TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=3					SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Glamer																	COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 minute				RANGE:Medium		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) 10-foot cubes	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours				SAVEINFO:Will disbelief	SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:You transform the decor of a courtyard, structure, or other edifice to meet your highest standards and personal tastes. Objects and architectural elements remain in the same configuration - a chair remains a chair—but can look, sound, and smell like a different physical material and artistic style. You cannot change the appearance of natural terrain, but landscaped areas such as a garden or orchard can be affected. This spell functions in all other ways as hallucinatory terrain.
Litany of Admonition								TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Antipaladin,Paladin=3|Inquisitor=4				SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent								COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 swift action			RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:one creature				DURATION:1 round								SAVEINFO:Fort negates	SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.13		DESC:You point out your target’s faults and failures, staggering the target for 1 round. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.
Litany of Dependability								TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=3|Inquisitor=4							SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Lawful											COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 immediate action		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:one creature				DURATION:1 round								SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.13		DESC:By uttering this litany, you cause one creature to take the average result of its next attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.
Litany of Duty										TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=1|Inquisitor=2							SCHOOL:Abjuration								DESCRIPTOR:Lawful											COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 immediate action		RANGE:personal		TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:Instantaneous							SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.13		DESC:You repeat a mantra or phrase that reminds you of your duty. You can immediately reroll a failed saving throw against a spell that would force you to take an action against your will, and you gain a +2 bonus against enchantment effects for 1 round. You can use this spell to reroll only a saving throw that you failed within the past round. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.
Litany of Order										TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=2|Inquisitor=3							SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Lawful,Language-Dependent						COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 swift action			RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:one creature				DURATION:1 round								SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.13		DESC:By shouting a forceful litany of strictures, you make a chaotic creature more susceptible to the attacks of lawful creatures. If the target is chaotic, it takes double the normal damage from attacks made by creatures that have a lawful aura from a class feature or by creatures that have the lawful subtype. If the target also has the chaotic subtype, when it is hit with attacks made by creatures with a lawful aura, it is also sickened for 1 round. If this spell targets a nonchaotic creature (or one that lacks the chaotic subtype), it has no effect and the spell is wasted. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.
Prophetic Lore										TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6								SCHOOL:Divination																							COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:see below				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:Instantaneous							SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.10		DESC:You call to mind prophecies regarding a person, place, item, or event. These might be predictions made in the past, lost to history, or entirely new. If the person or item is present or if you are at the desired location, the casting time is 1d4×10 minutes; if you have general but specific information about the subject, the casting time is 1d4×2 hours. If you have only rumors, you cannot cast this spell with any effect. More than one prophecy can come to mind when you cast this spell, and each are of varying detail and accuracy. Roll d%% and add %1 to determine results this spell returns, as listed in the spell description.|max(min(CASTERLEVEL,10),1)
Unflappable Mien									TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Force											COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL)*10 minutes or until discharged	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:When a creature attempts to touch you with an attack (such as a touch attack, an unarmed strike, an attack with a natural weapon, or a grapple), it feels a field of force blocking its way. It can choose to abandon the attempt, losing its action, or to push through the ward. If it pushes through, you can trigger a wave of force against that creature. This discharges the spell, deals %1d4 points of force damage, and pushes the creature back 5 feet. If the creature cannot be pushed back 5 feet (if a solid surface is directly behind it, for example), it takes 2d4 additional points of force damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the total amount of force damage the creature takes.|min(CASTERLEVEL,10)
