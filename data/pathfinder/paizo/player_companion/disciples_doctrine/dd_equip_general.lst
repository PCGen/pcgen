Convocation Bells													TYPE:Goods.Tools.Instrument.Percussion.Resizable											COST:100	WT:10																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.28																											DESC:This set of simple brass bells is held in a wheeled stand that allows bell ringers to easily move the ensemble.

Disguised Holy Text													TYPE:Goods.Tools.Book																		COST:25		WT:2																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.28																											DESC:This book appears to be the holy text of a particular religion, but it is actually a subtly encoded version of the text of an entirely different faith. Such tomes allow the faithful to keep copies of their holy texts hidden in plain sight-especially when those tomes are outlawed or stigmatized. A creature reading a disguised holy text can notice the irregularities of the text with a successful DC 18 Linguistics check; if the result of this check is 25 or higher, the creature cracks the text's cipher and understands its true meaning. A follower of a disguised holy text's true faith gains a +5 bonus on her Linguistics check to decipher the tome.
Ritual Disk															TYPE:Goods.General																			COST:20		WT:1																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.28																											DESC:This simple disk, usually carved from stone or fashioned from metal, is engraved with a portion of a specific religious rite or ritual.

The next time that day she attempts a roll of the chosen type, she rolls twice and takes the more favorable result.
