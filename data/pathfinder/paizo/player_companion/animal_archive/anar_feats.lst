###Block: Benefit Section
# Feat			Benefit
Boon Companion.MOD	BENEFIT:The abilities of your animal companion or familiar are calculated as though your class were 4 levels higher, to a maximum effective druid level equal to your character level. If you have more than one animal companion or familiar, choose one to receive this benefit. If you lose or dismiss an animal companion or familiar that has received this benefit, you may apply this feat to the replacement creature. Special: You may select this feat more than once. The effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different animal companion or familiar.
Critical Conduit.MOD	BENEFIT:When delivering a touch spell for your master, the critical threat range of your touch attack is doubled. This feat does not stack with Improved Critical or other effects that increase critical threat range.
Extra Item Slot.MOD	BENEFIT:Choose one magic item slot not normally available to creatures with your shape. You can now use magic items in that slot.
Familiar Focus.MOD	BENEFIT:Whenever your master targets you with a harmless spell or spell-like ability, your master's effective caster level for the effect is increased by 1.
Familiar Spell.MOD	BENEFIT:You can transfer a prepared spell to your familiar, allowing the familiar to cast that spell at a later time. Variables that rely on caster level function according to your caster level, not your familiar's Hit Dice, though your familiar's Intelligence may influence how precisely it can follow your instructions on how to use these spells. Your familiar must be able to speak to cast spells with a verbal component (the ability to speak with its master or creatures of its kind is insufficient). Your familiar must be carrying any material or focus components necessary, unless the materials cost less than i gp and the spell is prepared with Eschew Materials. Attack rolls use your familiar's ability scores. A familiar spell counts against the number of spells you may prepare for as long as your familiar retains the spell. Once your familiar casts a retained spell, you can prepare a new spell in that slot the next time you prepare spells. A familiar spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell's actual level. Your familiar can store a number of spell levels (including this modifier) equal to your caster level, but no spell's adjusted level can exceed half your caster level. Special: If you are a spontaneous caster, you must select a specific spell with which to imbue your familiar; you cannot imbue your familiar with an open spell slot.
Jumper.MOD			BENEFIT:You always count as having a running start when making jump checks using Acrobatics. Acrobatics becomes a class skill for you.
Lithe Attacker.MOD	BENEFIT:You can attack from nooks and crannies, even while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space less than half as wide as your normal space, and you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space. You still take a -4 penalty to AC while using Escape Artist in this way.
Master Of Your Kind.MOD	BENEFIT:Your master gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks with animals of your kind. In addition, once per day you can use animal messen11er, animal trance, or charm animal as a spell-like ability, using your master's caster level but your own Charisma modifier. These abilities affect only animals of your kind, and you gain only one use of this ability per day (not one of each ability); however, you can gain one additional use of any one of these three abilities by having your master sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of the same level or higher as a standard action.
Narrow Frame.MOD		BENEFIT:You do not take penalties on your attack rolls or to your AC for squeezing through a narrow space that is at least half as wide as your normal space, though each move into or through a narrow space still counts as if it were 2 squares. Normal: You take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to AC while squeezing.
Spell Sponge.MOD		BENEFIT:Whenever your master targets you with a harmless spell with a target of "you" the spell's duration is doubled as if modified by the Extend Spell metamagic feat. This does not affect spells with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent, or spells already modified by Extend Spell.
Stable Gallop.MOD		BENEFIT:Your AC penalty when charging is halved. The penalties on ranged attacks made by your rider are reduced by i when you take a double move and by 2 when you run (minimum penalty of o). Your rider gains a +4 bonus on concentration checks caused by your motion.
Sure-Footed.MOD		BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks to keep your balance and Reflex saves to avoid falling. You can move at a normal speed on steep slopes and stairs and do not risk falling when running or charging downhill. Normal: Moving uphill costs 2 squares of movement to enter each square of steep slope. Running or charging downhill requires a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check (or DC 10 Ride check for mounted characters) or you risk falling (Path.finder RP G Core Rulebook 42 8).
Valiant Steed.MOD		BENEFIT:You gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear and emotion effects. If you can serve as a mount, your rider gains a +4 morale bonus on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks to force you within range of a creature with the unnatural aura universal monster rule. In addition, the DC to push you with the Handle Animal skill does not increase if you are wounded or have taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage. Normal: The DC to push an animal increases by 2 if the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage.
