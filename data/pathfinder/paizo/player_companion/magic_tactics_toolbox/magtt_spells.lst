Akashic Communion					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Medium,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Witch=3|Mesmerist,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Wizard=4					SCHOOL:Divination												CASTTIME:10 minutes		COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes																		SOURCEPAGE:p.16				DESC:You attempt to obtain a glimpse of some specific event from the Akashic Record (Occult Adventures 244), the extraplanar repository of all experiences that have ever occurred. This allows you to attempt one Knowledge skill check of your choice per 3 caster levels you have, each with a +10 insight bonus. You are treated as trained in any Knowledge skills used for these checks, and can use this spell to reroll a Knowledge skill check you have already failed. The GM rolls these Knowledge checks in secret, as the Akashic Record is incredibly remote, and impressions gleaned from the distant repository are sometimes skewed when received. On a natural 1, the resulting answer is wildly inaccurate. This spell provides experiential guidance based on your ability to understand the flashes of insight gleaned from the Akashic Record, rather than the perfect knowledge available to those who travel to the extraplanar repository of knowledge. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends. Once you have used this spell to gain information on a specific topic or event, you cannot use it for Knowledge checks regarding that topic or event again until you have gained a caster level. [Material Components] a square of reflective silver worth 100 gp
Alaznist's Jinx		NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard=4|Inquisitor,Occultist,Shaman,Witch=5|Cleric,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=6					SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Curse				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:Permanent				SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.21				DESC:You inflict a curse similar to the spell burn spellblight (Ultimate Magic 97) on a creature. Each time a spellcaster who is afflicted with this curse casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin seems to burn as though she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level of the spell cast or spell-like ability used), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she loses the spell or spell slot and is staggered for a round. Unlike with the spell burn spellblight, the burning sensation is a tangible effect, visible during the act of spellcasting as an incorporeal, violet flame surrounding the caster.
Bind Sage						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=4|Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Witch=5									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Calling								CASTTIME:10 minutes		COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Close; see text	TARGETAREA:One caulborn (Bestiary 3 p48)									DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:No and yes; see text		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:This variant of planar binding is specifically used to call one of the most knowledgeable types of outsiders: the immortal and prophetic caulborn (Bestiary 3 p48). This spell calls a single caulborn into a specially prepared trap. The caster of this spell can compel a bound caulborn only to provide information (using its Knowledge skills or detect thoughts); attempts to compel the caulborn to fight, guard a location, or perform some other task automatically fail. This spell otherwise functions as planar binding. The most effective gifts for a caulborn are unique books or intelligent creatures upon whose thoughts the caulborn can feed. The true names of caulborn are nearly impossible to discover, as they are not inherently individualistic, but certain reclusive scholar communities in Kaer Maga may know titles by which specific caulborn can be called.
Biting Words					TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Bard,Bloodrager=1																SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent|Sonic	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.9				DESC:Your voice becomes suffused with magic so that you can harm your opponents with but a word. As a standard action, you can target one opponent within 30 feet with a ranged touch attack by speaking to it, dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d6+%1. The damage dealt is bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and can be reduced by damage reduction. Each attack you make reduces the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves. You can attack with biting words by shouting instead of speaking intelligibly. When doing so, the amount of damage dealt by the attack is reduced to 1d4+%2, but the spell doesn't count as having the language-dependent descriptor for that attack.|max(STR,CHA)|(max(STR,CHA))/2
Bone Fists						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Cleric,Druid,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Necromancy												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two more than 30 feet apart				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:None (harmless)						SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.5				DESC:The bones of your targets' joints grow thick and sharp, protruding painfully through the skin at the knuckles, elbows, shoulders, spine, and knees. The targets each gain a +1 bonus to natural armor and a +2 bonus on damage rolls with natural weapons, and they are treated as having armor spikes, with which they are proficient. [Material Components] the knucklebone of a dire animal
Bouncing Bomb Admixture				TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Alchemist=3																	SCHOOL:Transmutation											CASTTIME:1 swift action		COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.10				DESC:Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of the next bomb you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (a formula with "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw your next bomb, choose one target that would normally be hit by the bomb's splash damage. The target is affected as if it suffered a direct hit from the bomb instead.
Earsend						TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4														SCHOOL:Necromancy												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:You cause one of your ears to tear itself free of your body and transform into a fly-like magical creature you control. This functions like skinsend (UM), except your ear is a Fine construct with a fly speed equal to your base speed and a bonus on Fly checks equal to half your caster level. Your sense of hearing functions from your animated ear as if it were connected to your head, allowing you to hear as well as you normally could from your animated ear's vantage point. [Material Components] butterfly wing
Flash Forward					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Bard,Bloodrager,Inquisitor,Magus,Medium,Occultist,Paladin=4|Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,F		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:None (harmless)						SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.5				DESC:You cheat the laws of time and enter into combat before reverting back to your original position. As part of the action to cast the spell, you make a charge attack against an enemy. You make this charge attack normally, accounting for terrain, obstacles, attacks of opportunity, attack rolls, and damage rolls. At the end of your charge action, you instantly teleport back to your original location as a free action. Any damage or conditions dealt by you or to you during this action are real and remain when you return to your original location. [Material Components] a single gear or bit of clockwork
Flexile Curse					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Inquisitor,Witch=3|Cleric,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Curse				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:Permanent				SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.21				DESC:You curse your target with a withering aura that degrades its armor and shield (if any). This reduces the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus of any armor or shield worn by the target by 1. For every hour the target wears a suit of armor or a shield, the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus are reduced by an additional 1. If the armor or shield's hardness is reduced to 0, anytime the target of the curse is struck while wearing that item, there is a 20%% chance that it gains the broken condition. If the enhancement bonus of magic suit of armor or shield is reduced to 0, the armor or shield loses any other special abilities it had. If the target removes the suit of armor or shield (even if it's broken or has been drained of all enhancement bonuses), the armor or shield regains its hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus at the rate of 1 per 2 hours. A suit of armor or shield broken by this curse that regains its full hardness ceases to be broken. A magic suit of armor or shield that lost its special abilities regains them when its enhancement bonus is fully restored.
Hidden Blades					TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Bard,Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer								CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Weapon or ammunition touched; see text							DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)				SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:You render a target weapon or up to 50 pieces of ammunition invisible, granting the wielder a +20 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the weapon or ammunition and a +5 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to feint with the weapon or ammunition. [Material Components] a shard of glass
Impenetrable Veil					TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist,Spiritualist=6|Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9									SCHOOL:Abjuration												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:You enchant the target so it is nearly impossible to detect by both magical and mundane means, granting it the following benefits. The target gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half your caster level, and can use Stealth to hide from all creatures attempting to perceive it, even when it lacks concealment or cover. It can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from creatures using blindsight, blindsense, or any ability that functions as either (such as lifesense or tremorsense). Furthermore, the target leaves no trail and cannot be tracked unless it chooses to leave a trail. If a creature attempts to discern the target's presence or location using divination magic (including magic items with a divination aura such as a crystal ball), that creature must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the target's Stealth bonus to discern any information about the target, and on a failed check cannot do so for the spell's duration. [Material Components] dust from the Dimension of Dreams worth 1,250 gp
Innocuous Shape					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4											SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Living creature touched										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:This spell transforms a creature into a Medium or smaller animal or humanoid of no more than 1 Hit Die. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal, the spell functions as beast shape II. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell can function as alter self, youthful appearance (UM), or both, such that you can transform a creature into a generic, youthful humanoid of any type. Any creature that interacts with the target of this spell must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the DC of the spell) or view the target in the most innocuous possible light. On a failed saving throw, the creature views all of the target's actions as inoffensive and no cause for concern unless the target becomes an obvious threat. The creature can otherwise act normally, and feels no compunction to obey or ignore the target; it simply assumes none of the target's actions are dangerous or malicious unless shown evidence that proves otherwise. [Material Components] a handful of dandelion seeds
Irregular Size					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Medium=2|Antipaladin,Cleric,Mesmerist,Occultist,Shaman,Witch=3|Bloodrager,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Curse				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:Permanent				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates						SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.21				DESC:You curse a creature so one set of its limbs (typically its arms, legs, or wings) shrivels in size. [Arms]-The creature counts as one size category smaller for the purpose of determining the size of weapon it can wield. If the creature is capable of making natural attacks with its arms, the damage dealt by those attacks decreases as though the target were one size category smaller than its actual size. [Legs]-The creature's base speed decreases by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and its Strength score counts as 4 lower for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity. [Wings]-The creature's Fly speed decreases by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet), the damage dealt by any wing attacks decreases as though the target were one size category smaller than its actual size, and its fly maneuverability decreases by a step (to a minimum of clumsy).
Itching Curse					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Druid,Inquisitor,Occultist,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1							SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Curse				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:One living creature with 5 HD or fewer							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]		SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.22				DESC:You curse the target with a distracting, unbearable itch. Unless the target scratches as a move action, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
Kalistocrat's Nightmare	NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Inquisitor,Investigator,Magus,Occultist,Witch=2|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3					SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Curse				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours; see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.22				DESC:You temporarily curse a creature so its touch lessens the value of coins it touches. While under the effects of this curse, whenever the target touches a coin of higher value than copper piece, that coin changes into a copper piece. The change takes place over the course of the following minute, allowing the target to interact with multiple coins before the effect of the curse becomes apparent. The affected coins are permanently transmuted from their previous material (typically gold or silver) into copper coins, though remove curse (which can affect up to 50 coins with a single casting) or a similar spell can restore them to their previous material. [Material Components] a copper piece
Lost Legacy						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Inquisitor,Occultist,Witch=6|Cleric,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=7								SCHOOL:Enchantment					DESCRIPTOR:Curse|Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,DF/F	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:Permanent				SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.22				DESC:You inflict a powerful curse on a touched creature that causes others to quickly forget positive aspects of their interactions with the target. The target cannot attempt a Diplomacy (or wild empathy or similar ability) check to improve the attitude of other creatures. Any creature that normally has an attitude of friendly or helpful toward the target must succeed at a Will save at the spell's normal saving throw DC each time it interacts with the target, or its attitude becomes indifferent. Once this curse is removed, creatures coming back into contact with the target regain their pleasant memories of it. If their attitudes toward the target have not been reduced from indifferent, their original attitudes are restored. [Spell Focus] a holy symbol of a dead or forgotten deity, or flag of a fallen or forgotten nation
Nondetection (Lesser)				TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=2|Ranger=3								SCHOOL:Abjuration												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:Creature touched											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:This spell functions like nondetection, except it blocks the effects of only divination spells and effects that target an area, rather than you or an object in your possession specifically. For example, lesser nondetection doesn't ward you against a spellcaster who is attempting to scry on you with the scrying spell or find an object in your possession with locate object, but it does protect you against effects that target an area you happen to be in, such as detect spells or clairaudience/clairvoyance. [Material Components] a drop of mercury
Particulate Form					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Occultist=5|Cleric,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7											SCHOOL:Transmutation											CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two more than 30 feet apart				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]		SAVEINFO:None (harmless)						SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.6				DESC:The targets' physical forms undergo a bizarre transformation. They look and function normally, but are composed of countless particles that separate and reconnect to remain whole. Each target gains fast healing 1 and is immune to bleed damage, critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage. The value of this fast healing increases by 1 at caster levels 10th, 15th, and 20th. Any target can end the spell effect on itself as a swift action; the target then regains 5d6 hit points and can attempt an additional saving throw against any one disease or poison affecting it (at the original save DC), ending that disease or poison with a successful saving throw. [Material Components] a pinch of fine sand
Phantasmal Reminder				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3|Bard,Shaman=4								SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Medium		TARGETAREA:One living creature										DURATION:1 round; see text			SAVEINFO:Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.26				DESC:You create a memory loop of a successful attack made against the target, forcing its conscious mind to recall the details of the attack in such excruciating detail that its physical body is racked by the recollection. This spell can affect only a creature that has taken damage since the end of your last turn. The target first can attempt a Will save to recognize the attack as unreal. If it fails that saving throw, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take an amount of damage equal to min(10,CASTERLEVEL)d6. Because the damage is a quasi-real memory of existing wounds, this damage can't be reduced or prevented (such as by the shield other spell). If the target of a phantasmal reminder attack succeeds at the Will save to disbelieve the memory loop and either has natural telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the memory of damage automatically rebounds to affect you. You must immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve; if you fail, you take half the spell's damage yourself.
Phasic Challenge					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Spiritualist=6|Witch=7|Cleric,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=8									SCHOOL:Transmutation											CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:Two creatures within 60 feet of one another; see text					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]		SAVEINFO:Will negates; see below					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.6				DESC:You select one enemy and one willing ally as targets. The enemy gains a new Will saving throw at the beginning of each turn, and on a successful saving throw the spell ends. Both targets remain visible and audible, and can see and hear other creatures, but cannot physically interact with any creature save one another. Spells or weapon attacks from the affected creatures impact only each other, though spells might affect terrain or other factors not related to other creatures. If one of the creatures becomes unconscious or dies, or if the effect is dispelled, the effect ends for both of them. [Material Components] a scrap of a knight's banner
Release the Hounds				TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=5											SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:One pack of canines										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]		SAVEINFO:None								SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.10				DESC:This spell summons a pack of canines that respond to the spellcaster's commands and act in perfect unison, causing them to function like a swarm. The pack uses the statistics for a winter wolf (Bestiary 280), except it loses its breath weapon, the cold subtype, and its cold special attack and gains the swarm subtype, a swarm attack that deals 3d6 points of damage, and the distraction special attack (DC 17). Whenever the pack damages an opponent with its swarm attack, it can immediately attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that creature with its trip special attack. The pack does not gain any damage reduction or immunity to damage and can be attacked by effects that target a specific number of creatures, though such attacks deal 1/4 the normal amount of damage (25%%) and effects that don't deal hit point damage are only 25%% likely to work. [Material Components] shards of a canine's fang
Roaming Pit						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=5|Cleric,Druid,Psychic=6											SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Medium		TARGETAREA:Mobile 10-ft.-by-10-ft. hole, (10*(CASTERLEVEL/2)) ft. deep				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SAVEINFO:Reflex negates							SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.13				DESC:This spell functions as create pit (APG) , except the pit is capable of movement. As a move action, you can direct the pit to move up to 20 feet, though it must always remain on a horizontal surface large enough to accommodate its area. If the pit's movement causes it to share a space with a creature on the same horizontal surface, that creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or fall into the pit. Any creature that avoids falling into the pit when it reaches its new destination moves to the nearest safe space. Creatures that fall into the pit move with it if it is relocated. [Material Components] powered diamond dust worth 10 gp
Secluded Grimoire					TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=1															SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning							CASTTIME:1 round			COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Spellbook touched											DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:None								SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.17				DESC:This spell sends a spellbook into a random but safe location on the Ethereal Plane, where it remains indefinitely. When you cast this spell, the target spellbook dissolves into quickly fading lines of energy and runes that reflect all of the spells stored within. Thereafter, you can retrieve the spellbook by concentrating as a standard action, causing it to reappear in your hands. You cannot cast this spell on another spellbook if you currently have a spellbook in the Ethereal Plane. No other creatures or objects accompany the spellbook you send away, and the duration of any spells currently affecting the spellbook continue normally.
Spellcurse						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Inquisitor=2|Cleric,Psychic,Witch=3|Occultist,Shaman=4								SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Curse				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Medium		TARGETAREA:One creature												DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will half							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.6				DESC:You disrupt any spell energy affecting your target, causing that energy to crackle with power and harm the target. The target takes 1d6 points of damage for each spell with a duration of 1 round or greater currently affecting it. The spells themselves are not dispelled or modified. [Material Components] a fragment of a destroyed magical item
Symbol of Distraction				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Occultist=4|Bard,Cleric,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6								SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:10 minutes		COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:0 feet; see text	TARGETAREA:One symbol												DURATION:See text					SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.26				DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of a symbol of distraction instead become fascinated by the symbol for (10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of distraction has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of distraction simply remains active for a duration of (10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes. All fascinated creatures move toward the symbol of distraction, trying to remain within the symbol's area of effect. If the symbol leads affected creatures into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature can attempt an additional Will saving throw, with success indicating it is no longer fascinated. If a creature's view of the symbol is completely blocked, it is immediately freed of the symbol's effect. [Material Components] mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp
Touch of Slumber					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=5|Bard,Psychic,Witch=6									SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Nonhostile creature touched									DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.26				DESC:This spell functions only against a creature with an attitude toward you of indifferent or better, and only if the target is not hostile toward you or your visible allies. A target touched by you (this touch usually requires a successful melee touch attack) must succeed at a Will saving throw or fall asleep for 2d6 hours. While asleep, the creature is helpless. For 1 minute after the creature is affected, any loud noise or rough contact causes it to awaken immediately. Thereafter, slapping or wounding an affected creature awakens it, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (this is an application of the aid another action). [Material Components] a bit of seaweed
Wall of Bone					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bloodrager,Cleric,Psychic,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Wizard=4								SCHOOL:Necromancy												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:Solid wall of humanoid bones with an area of up to (CASTERLEVEL) 5-ft. squares	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:None								SPELLRES:Yes; see text			SOURCEPAGE:p.13				DESC:This spell creates a vertical wall of skeletal arms that attaches itself to any solid surface. The wall of bone works identically to wall of stone except as noted above and in this spell description. The wall of bone is (CASTERLEVEL/4) inches thick and composed of up to (CASTERLEVEL) 5-foot squares. The wall created must be vertical, and must rest upon a firm foundation. It cannot be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or to act as a ramp. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 4 and ((CASTERLEVEL/4)*7) hit points. A section of wall whose hit points drops to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check is (15+(CASTERLEVEL/4)*2). &nl; For each creature adjacent to the wall, the skeletal hands attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple it. The skeletal hands do not provoke attacks of opportunity. They make their attacks at the start of your turn, when the wall is summoned, or when an enemy first moves adjacent to the wall. The skeletal hands' CMB is (CASTERLEVEL), and they can grapple a Huge or smaller creature with no penalty. &nl; If the wall successfully grapples a foe, that foe takes 1d6 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The wall cannot move or pin foes. Each round the wall succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check, it deals 1d6 additional points of damage. The CMD of the wall, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is (10+CASTERLEVEL). [Material Components] a polished humanoid femur
Warp Metal						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Cleric,Druid,Medium,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=4								SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Earth				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) Small metal objects, all within a 20-ft. radius; see text		DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)					SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.6				DESC:You cause metal to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a successful Strength check to open, at your option). A vehicle grinds to a halt and ceases to operate. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon imposes a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You can warp (CASTERLEVEL) Small or smaller objects or its equivalent. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. Alternatively, you can unwarp metal (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. Make whole, on the other hand, does nothing to repair a warped item. You can combine multiple consecutive castings of warp metal to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single casting. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects. [Material Components] a twisted wire

Poisoned Egg					TYPE:Divine																								SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Poison				CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,DF	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One egg												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:None (object)			SPELLRES:No (object)		SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:ISG	SOURCEPAGE:p.238	DESC:You transform the contents of a normal egg into a single dose of small centipede poison (injury; save DC 11; fequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1 Dex; cure 1 save). The poison reverts to a normal egg at the end of the spell's duration (the reverted egg substance is harmless unless the poisoned creature is vulnerable to eggs). The egg may be raw or cooked but must be whole and not empty when you cast the spell. When applying the poisoned egg's contents to a weapon, the wielder has no chance of poisoning herself, as though she had the poison use class feature.
