DESC:Hundreds of New Items! Whether your character's in the market for an exotic weapon, a new pet, or an unusual alchemical item to help in exploring old tombs, this book has it covered. Adventurer's Armory is the go-to sourcebook for supplementing your character's gear; all of the items are nonmagical and most of them are priced low enough that even 1st-level heroes can afford them!
