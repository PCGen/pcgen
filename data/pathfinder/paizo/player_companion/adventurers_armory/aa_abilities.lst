#Heavy Blade Scabbard Tricks
Capture Weapon		KEY:Heavy Blade Scabbard Trick ~ Capture Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:When you successfully disarm an opponent's manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a -4 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM's discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard.																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:22
Find the Hidden		KEY:Heavy Blade Scabbard Trick ~ Find the Hidden	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a -2 penalty and no miss chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn).																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:22
Grab Purchase		KEY:Heavy Blade Scabbard Trick ~ Grab Purchase		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn.																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:22
Hurl Scabbard		KEY:Heavy Blade Scabbard Trick ~ Hurl Scabbard		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can draw your weapon in such a way that you send your combat scabbard (see page 3) whirling off to strike at any creature in sight. This ranged attack is a swift action and is treated as a thrown weapon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:22
Steer Opponent		KEY:Heavy Blade Scabbard Trick ~ Steer Opponent		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:22
Tangle Leg			KEY:Heavy Blade Scabbard Trick ~ Tangle Leg		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent's legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach.

#Shield Tricks
Break Ground		KEY:Shield Trick ~ Break Ground				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent's feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach. Whether or not you succeed, as long as your shield remains where you threw it, the opponent treats that square as difficult terrain until he moves out of the square.																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:23
Hurl Shield			KEY:Shield Trick ~ Hurl Shield				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can throw your shield as a ranged improvised weapon. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield to perform this trick. If you are using a throwing shield, there is no reason to use this trick.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:23
Little Wall			KEY:Shield Trick ~ Little Wall				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can contort your body behind your shield in order to gain a brief moment of security. Whenever you use the total defense action, you may choose to gain cover instead of the normal dodge bonus to AC.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:23
Keen Eye			KEY:Shield Trick ~ Keen Eye					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You have mastered the art of using the reflective surface of your shield to locate foes that you dare not look at directly. On your turn, you may choose to forfeit your shield's AC bonus for 1 round to improve your defenses against one creature using a gaze attack. Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature's gaze attack increases to 100%%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:23
Release Shield		KEY:Shield Trick ~ Release Shield				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield as a free action. Once you've removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:23
Ricochet Shield		KEY:Shield Trick ~ Ricochet Shield				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:23
Shield Gag			KEY:Shield Trick ~ Shield Gag					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouth-based abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you both lose the grappled condition and return to your own squares, though your shield remains in its mouth. The creature may remove the shield by destroying it (or leaving it with the broken condition), forcing the shield out of its mouth with a grapple check against your CMB, or swallowing it (if it has the swallow whole ability) as if the shield were a creature. While the shield is in place, the monster cannot use its mouth to make attacks against anything but the shield and cannot speak clearly enough to cast spells or use items requiring speech. If it uses a breath weapon, its range is half normal and any damage dealt must first get through the shield, with any remaining damage affecting the area normally.
