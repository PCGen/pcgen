Augmented Disguise		KEY:Trait ~ Augmented Disguise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Augmented Disguise],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]			DESC:You are especially good at disguising yourself when you have props available.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	DESC:You gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks when wearing a wig, false beard, or similar large prop, or if you are wearing a special costume or eye-catching bauble that reinforces your disguise.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																																																																															STACK:NO																				SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Dealmaker				KEY:Trait ~ Dealmaker				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Dealmaker],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]				DESC:You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	DESC:Once per week, when looking for an item with a price greater than the local community's base value (see page 461 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), make a DC 10 Diplomacy check; add 10 to the DC for each community size category between the current community and the community size with a base value sufficient for that item. Success means (with GM approval) you're able to sell or purchase that item as if the local community were of sufficient size. Each additional attempt (successful or otherwise) in that community increases the DC by an additional +10. Example: If you're trying to find a +1 cloak of resistance (1,000 gp), you'd normally need to be in a small town (base value 1,000 gp) or larger to be able to find that item with little trouble. If you're currently in a hamlet, that's two community sizes away from a small town, so the Diplomacy DC is 30. If you went to a village and asked there, the DC would only be 20 because it's only one community size away from a small town.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	STACK:NO																				SOURCEPAGE:p.30

This does not apply to improvised weapon penalties. Your GM may rule that some things are just not suitable for use in certain ways; for example, gluing a dead orc's face to your own face won't help you disguise yourself as an orc.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																																									STACK:NO																				SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Iron Liver				KEY:Trait ~ Iron Liver				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.EquipmentTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Iron Liver],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.EquipmentTrait]				DESC:Due to a lucky constitution or frequent exposure, your body is resistant to poison, including alcohol and drugs.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	DESC:You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and drugs, and a +4 trait bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid the effects of alcohol.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																																																																																		STACK:NO																				SOURCEPAGE:p.30	ASPECT:SaveBonus|+2 trait bonus to Fortitude saves vs. poison and drugs, +4 trait bonus to Fortitude saves to avoid the effects of alcohol

The DC for the check is 20 for items of a similar size, shape, and color (such as a glaive and a quarterstaff). Items of a different shape, size, or color raise the DC by 5 for each dissimilar aspect, or more if the dissimilarity is extreme. This deception lasts 1 minute; if the item is still in view, the observers may recognize their error unless you make another bluff check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																																STACK:NO																				SOURCEPAGE:p.30

The item is expended without its normal effects and only serves to make your performance more impressive; for example, you could pretend to ignite yourself with alchemist's fire as part of a Perform (comedy) check or make a dramatic appearance with a smokestick as part of a Perform (act) check, but you would not actually take fire damage or gain concealment from smoke.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																															STACK:NO																				SOURCEPAGE:p.31

The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the gp difference between costs of the outfits.
