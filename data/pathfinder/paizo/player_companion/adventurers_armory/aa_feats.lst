STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|Special Ability|TYPE=EquipmentTrick							SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:You may use any equipment tricks relating to the item if you meet the appropriate trick requirements. If the item would normally be considered an improvised weapon, you may treat it as a normal weapon or an improvised weapon, whichever is more beneficial for you. You can gain the Equipment Trick feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of equipment.

Sly Draw				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Quick Draw									DESC:You can draw your weapon with such speed and finesse that your opponents don't realize they're threatened.																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:When you draw a light weapon, you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat. Other feats and abilities that affect a feint still apply to your feint.
Splash Weapon Mastery		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																DESC:When throwing a splash weapon, you act as if you had the Far Shot feat. When you hit with a splash weapon, select one additional square adjacent to the splash area; creatures in this area also take splash damage. When you miss with a splash weapon, you may adjust the miss direction on the grid by +1 or -1. This feat counts as Far Shot for the purpose of qualifying for other feats, but only in regard to splash weapons.														SOURCELONG:Adventurer's Armory	SOURCEPAGE:31
# I would think this is how to code it, but it doesn't work.  Then again, I don't think Far Shot works as coded either.
