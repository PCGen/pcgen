Burdened Thoughts			CLASSES:Druid,Shaman,Witch=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=3					SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.26				DESC:You fill a creature's mind with the realization of its earthly weight and responsibilities. Disheartened and wearied by these thoughts, the creature gains heavy encumbrance and is unable to fly (if already flying, it must land as soon as possible). If the creature is three or more size categories larger than you, it's also staggered.
Hollow Blades			CLASSES:Ranger=1|Magus=2|Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.26				DESC:All melee and natural attacks from the target deal damage as if the target were one size category smaller than it actually is. While the target is under the effects of this spell, weapons dropped by the target function normally for other creatures, while any melee weapons picked up by the target deal damage as if one size smaller. Ranged attacks and weapons are unaffected by this spell.
Resize Item				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One weapon or suit of armor weighing up to (CASTERLEVEL*25) lbs		DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	SOURCEPAGE:Rear Inside Cover		DESC:You alter a magic weapon or suit of armor to be up to two size categories larger or smaller. If the spell on a resized suit of armor ends while the armor is being worn, the armor falls off harmlessly. If the spell would cause an item to grow too large for the area containing it, its growth halts just before that point. Resize item can be made permanent with a permanency spell for 7,500 gp.
Runic Overload			CLASSES:Bloodrager=3|Magus=4|Sorcerer,Wizard=5|Witch=6			SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Sonic				TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature or object									DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:See text				SPELLRES:See text		SOURCEPAGE:p.26				DESC:This spell charges magical runes to an explosive degree. If cast on a creature with magical runes on its body, such as a rune giant or a runescarred creature, it deals %1d6 points of sonic damage to the target and stuns the target for 1 round. When the spell is cast in this way, it must overcome the target's spell resistance. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The spell can also be cast on other magical runes, such as those from arcane mark or explosive runes. In this case, the resulting explosion deals %2d8 points of sonic damage to all creatures within a 5-foot radius. Creatures in the area that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage. This spell doesn't destroy runes; targeted runes continue to function normally. Mundane runes, such as ones in writing or runic tattoos, cannot be affected by this spell.|MIN(20,CASTERLEVEL)|MIN(10,CASTERLEVEL/2)
Siphon Might			CLASSES:Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Fortitude half			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.27				DESC:You drain the might of the target and transfer that power to another creature. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6 + %1. This effect can't cause the subject's Strength score to drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save halves this penalty. This penalty doesn't stack with itself or the penalty applied from ray of enfeeblement. You can grant any one creature adjacent to you (including yourself) an enhancement bonus to Strength equal to the Strength penalty imposed by this spell.|MIN(5,CASTERLEVEL/2)
Stone Throwing			CLASSES:Bloodrager,Ranger=1|Cleric,Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.27				DESC:The subject gains the rock throwing and rock catching abilities (Bestiary p.303). It can use these abilities with any solid, mostly inflexible object with a hardness of at least 5. The subject can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than its own size. The range increment for this attack is 20 feet, and rocks can be hurled a maximum of 5 range increments. Damage is based on the size of the subject-1d8 points of damage for a Large creature, 1d6 for a Medium creature, or 1d4 for a Small creature-plus 1-1/2 times the thrower's Strength bonus. For every size category smaller than Large the subject is, it receives a cumulative -5 penalty on Reflex saves to catch rocks (or similar projectiles) thrown at it.
Steal Size				CLASSES:Bloodrager,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2|Druid,Magus=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One humanoid creature larger than you						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.27				DESC:This spell reduces the target's size by one size category, as if it were affected by reduce person. You grow in size by one category, as if affected by enlarge person (if you can be targeted by that spell). If the spell is dispelled or otherwise ends for either you or the target, both you and the target return to your normal sizes.
Twisted Futures			CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Shaman,Witch=1|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Divination														TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.27				DESC:By rearranging the threads of fate, you disrupt fortunate outcomes for other creatures. A creature affected by this spell is unable to benefit from effects that grant the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result (like the swashbuckler's charmed life ability) or to choose the die result in lieu of rolling (like the wizard's prescience school power or the cyclops's flash of insight ability). This doesn't affect abilities that force a creature to take the lower of two rolls, such as ill omen or a pugwampi's unluck aura (Bestiary 2 p.144). A cyclops can't use its flash of insight ability to save against this spell.
