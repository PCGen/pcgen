SOURCEPAGE:19

SOURCEPAGE:19

SOURCEPAGE:19
Ruffian's Riff								KEY:Instrument Trick ~ Ruffian's Riff		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can treat a musical instrument as an improvised weapon with the performance special feature.

SOURCEPAGE:19

Guarding Ladder								KEY:Ladder Trick ~ Guarding Ladder			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can hold a ladder in one hand and treat it as a heavy wooden shield with the fragile special feature.

SOURCEPAGE:14
Ladder Fighter								KEY:Ladder Trick ~ Ladder Fighter			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You treat a ladder as a quarterstaff with the fragile and trip special features, and you can apply feats and abilities as if it were a quarterstaff (for example, a monk can use a ladder to perform a flurry of blows).

Ladder Lock									KEY:Ladder Trick ~ Ladder Lock			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:When you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against an adjacent opponent while you are holding a ladder, you can trap your target's limbs between the rungs of the ladder.

SOURCEPAGE:14
Vaulting Ladder								KEY:Ladder Trick ~ Vaulting Ladder			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can climb the length of a ladder as part of a running jump, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus on your Acrobatics check and adding the ladder's length to the total distance you travel with your jump.

SOURCEPAGE:14

Intensified Oil								KEY:Lantern Trick ~ Intensified Oil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can combine three flasks of oil into a single use of improved oil as you add it to a lamp or lantern. This improved oil causes the lamp or lantern to which it is added to burn more brightly than usual, increasing its light range by 50%%. This improved oil can only be used in the lamp or lantern it's mixed in and has no additional special effects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:15
Lantern Bash								KEY:Lantern Trick ~ Lantern Bash			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:If you carry a lamp or lantern in the hand you use to wield a light shield, your shield bash attacks with that shield deal an additional 1 point of fire damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:15

SOURCEPAGE:15
Lesser Light								KEY:Lantern Trick ~ Lesser Light			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:When lighting a lamp or lantern, you reduce the size of its flame to provide only dim light in the area in which the lantern usually provides normal light.

The lamp or lantern must be extinguished and re-lit to shed light normally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:15
Oil Splash									KEY:Lantern Trick ~ Oil Splash			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent while either you or the opponent is holding a lamp or lantern.

SOURCEPAGE:15

Blinding Light								KEY:Mirror Trick ~ Blinding Light			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:When in an area of normal or bright light, you can use a mirror held in your hand to shine light into the eyes of a creature within 10 feet as a move action. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or be dazzled for 1 round.|10+skillinfo("RANK", "Sleight of Hand")																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:15

SOURCEPAGE:15
Reflect Gaze								KEY:Mirror Trick ~ Reflect Gaze			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:As an immediate or swift action, you can use a mirror to reflect a gaze attack. You must either be looking at the creature with the gaze attack or averting your eyes to use this ability, and you must succeed at your saving throw to resist the creature's gaze attack (if you don't avoid the need to attempt a saving throw by averting your eyes). If you reflect the creature's gaze back at it, the creature must succeed at a saving throw to resist its own gaze or lose access to its gaze attack for 1 round. If the creature attempts to gaze at you with its attack action, you may attempt to reflect its gaze back at it, as above, or redirect its gaze to a new target within 30 feet of you. In this case, the new creature is treated as the target of the original gaze (unless it is blindfolded or otherwise unable to see), although it is automatically treated as if it is averting its eyes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:15
Telltale Reflection							KEY:Mirror Trick ~ Telltale Reflection		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You are familiar with the ways illusions don't precisely mimic natural objects when reflected. If you see an illusion within 10 feet reflected in a mirror, you count as having studied it carefully for the purposes of attempting a saving throw to disbelieve it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:15
Trickster's Mirror							KEY:Mirror Trick ~ Trickster's Mirror		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can use a mirror worth at least 10 gp as an additional material component for an illusion (figment) spell. The spell is treated as 1 spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:15

Pole Trip									KEY:Pole Trick ~ Pole Trip				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can treat a pole as an improvised weapon with the reach and trip special features. You can treat an unhinged folding pole as an improvised weapon with the disarm and trip special features. A pole or folding pole used as an improvised weapon deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:15
Seek the Unseen								KEY:Pole Trick ~ Seek the Unseen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:When you attempt to find a creature you cannot see (either because it is invisible, or because you are blind), you can sweep a pole through any two adjacent squares within 10 feet of you as a standard action. Make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you hit, and if a creature you cannot see is in the designated area, you deal no damage but have successfully pinpointed the creature's current location.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:15
Wall Climb									KEY:Pole Trick ~ Wall Climb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can climb narrow passageways if your pole can reach a wall or other solid surface on both sides, bracing yourself and scooting the pole further along the surface as you climb. This method is reliable but laborious; you gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Climb checks to climb in this manner, but you climb at half the usual speed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:15

Choking Smoke								KEY:Smokestick Trick ~ Choking Smoke		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:When you perform a successful dirty trick combat maneuver while holding a lit smokestick, you can shove the smokestick into your opponent's mouth (or other breathing apparatus) to impair its breathing. The affected creature begins choking and sputtering, gaining the sickened condition. Unlike a normal dirty trick, the foe must succeed at a Fortitude save to remove this condition, in addition to spending an action. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + half your base attack bonus + any bonus you add to dirty trick combat maneuvers (such as that granted by Improved Dirty Trick). This condition ends after 1 minute, if not removed sooner. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to this effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:25
Slow Burn									KEY:Smokestick Trick ~ Slow Burn			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can burn a smokestick just slowly enough to not consume it immediately. You must choose to use this trick when you light a smokestick. A slow-burning smokestick is not consumed after 1 round, and the smoke produced only lasts for 1 round. For the next hour, as a swift action when you are holding a slow-burning smokestick, you can use the smokestick to produce a cloud of smoke that lasts for only 1 round. The slow-burning smokestick lasts for 1 hour or until you have created a total of 10 clouds, at which point it is consumed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:25
Smoke Shadow								KEY:Smokestick Trick ~ Smoke Shadow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can use a slow-burning smokestick (using the slow burn trick) to conceal your motions while sneaking. While your smokestick is slow-burning, whenever a creature would succeed at an opposed Perception check against your Stealth check, you can emit a puff of smoke as an immediate action to hide your presence. When you do, the creature must reroll its Perception check and take the second result, even if it is worse. Even if the creature fails this Perception check, it is aware of your general location because of the sudden smoke (unless the location is already filled with smoke-like that emitted by the normal use of a smokestick-or fog).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:25
Smoke Strike								KEY:Smokestick Trick ~ Smoke Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can use a slow-burning smokestick (using the slow burn trick) to distract foes from your strikes. As a swift action when you are holding a slow-burning smokestick, instead of producing a cloud with the slow burn trick, you can create a small, dense burst of smoke in an adjacent foe's face. This allows you to feint as part of that swift action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:25

Captivating Embrace							KEY:Tanglefoot Bag Trick ~ Captivating Embrace	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You get up close and personal, then use a tanglefoot bag to keep things that way. When you successfully grapple a creature, you burst a tanglefoot bag to stick yourself to your target. You must have the tanglefoot bag in hand to use this ability unless you have the Quick Draw feat (in which case the tanglefoot bag must be easily accessible on your person). While the tanglefoot bag's effect lasts, you do not take a penalty to grapple checks for not having two hands free, and your opponent takes a -4 penalty on combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to break the grapple.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:26
Sticky Bombs								KEY:Tanglefoot Bag Trick ~ Sticky Bombs		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can slap another item on a tanglefoot bag and toss both to ensure contact. When you throw an alchemical item, you can attach a tanglefoot bag to it as you throw it; this does not require an additional action. On a hit, the target is affected by the tanglefoot bag, with the alchemical item firmly stuck in the goo. The item stays in the target's square as long the tanglefoot bag's effect lasts, making this most useful with items that don't immediately take effect, such as darkflares (see above) or fuse grenades UE .																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:26
Thieving Shield								KEY:Tanglefoot Bag Trick ~ Thieving Shield	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:As an immediate action, you can splatter a tanglefoot bag on your shield, making it sticky. Your shield gains the grapple weapon quality when used as a weapon with a shield bash attack. In addition, the first time each round an attack with a manufactured weapon misses you by 4 or less, you can make a free disarm attempt against that weapon. This disarm attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Your shield remains sticky for 2d4 rounds, after which it must be cleaned (a full-round action) before you can use this trick again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:26

Deafening Component							KEY:Thunderstone Trick ~ Deafening Component	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:You can add a thunderstone as an additional material component to any spell you cast with the electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor, or to any bomb you throw. Any creature damaged by that spell or bomb must also succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:26
Evolve Resilience								KEY:Thunderstone Trick ~ Evolve Resilience	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:Your eidolon can consume a thunderstone as a standard action to bolster its resilience against certain effects. For 1 hour, your eidolon gains the resistance evolution (electricity or sonic only). Your eidolon cannot gain both resistances from this trick at the same time. During this time, the eidolon is immune to the effects of thunderstones.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:26
Startling Noise								KEY:Thunderstone Trick ~ Startling Noise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:Your thunderstones are especially effective when foes don't know they're coming. Any creature that is completely unaware of your presence takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against thunderstones you use and, if deafened, takes an amount of nonlethal damage equal to your number of sneak attack or hidden strike dice (if any).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:26
Thunderclap									KEY:Thunderstone Trick ~ Thunderclap		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																				DESC:Your thunderstones enhance the concussive force of hammers you wield. This trick only works with hammers to which your Weapon Focus feat applies. As a move action, you can wedge a thunderstone in place on your hammer's striking surface. When you hit a foe with that hammer, the thunderstone detonates. You gain a +4 bonus on your saving throw against the thunderstone's effect (if necessary), and your foe takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw against the thunderstone's effect.
