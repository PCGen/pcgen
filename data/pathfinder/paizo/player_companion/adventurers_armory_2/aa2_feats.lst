Poppet Familiar			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General														PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=3],[PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Arcane,3]																																	PRETEXT:Ability to acquire a new familiar, caster level 3rd.																																																																																DESC:You may select a poppet as your familiar.																						ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Poppet Familiar List																					SOURCEPAGE:p.31	BENEFIT:You can choose a standard Tiny poppet that you control as your familiar. This poppet cannot have any existing augmentations. You absorb the poppet's token harmlessly into your body, making it impossible for you to transfer control of the poppet thereafter. A poppet familiar uses the rules for regular familiars, with the following exceptions: its type does not change, and it does not gain the ability to speak with others of its kind. The poppet's Wisdom score increases to match its Intelligence score and it can speak and understand one language chosen by you at the time you select the poppet as your familiar. A poppet familiar has Craft, Perception, Profession, and Stealth as class skills. A poppet familiar cannot receive augmentations from crafting, but its connection to you allows it to spontaneously generate augmentations of your choice as you increase in level. If your caster level is 5th or higher, your poppet familiar either becomes Small in size or gains two augmentations of your choice. You do not need to meet the requirements (or pay the construction cost) to craft these augmentations. At caster level 7th, and every 2 caster levels thereafter, your poppet familiar gains an additional augmentation of your choice. If your caster level is 7th or higher, your poppet familiar gains the ability to generate spray of splinters as a breath weapon that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage in a 15-foot cone. At caster level 9th and every 2 caster levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6 (to a maximum of 7d6 at 19th level). A poppet can use this breath weapon three times per day. If your poppet familiar is lost or destroyed, you can replace it with another standard Tiny poppet that you control by undertaking a ritual that takes 8 hours to complete. If your previous poppet familiar was Small or had gained augmentations, you can choose different augmentations for your new poppet familiar.

SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:You take no penalty for using an improvised tool associated with a skill in which you have at least 1 rank. For example, if you have 1 rank in Disable Device, you take no penalty when opening a lock without a proper tool. If you have at least 3 ranks in a skill, you can treat a normal tool associated with that skill as though it were a masterwork tool.
