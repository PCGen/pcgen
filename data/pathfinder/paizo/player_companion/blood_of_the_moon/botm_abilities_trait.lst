Animal-Minded		KEY:Skinwalker ~ Animal-Minded	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skinwalker Racial Trait.SpecialQuality			DESC:(2 RP): Skinwalkers have a +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Change Shape		KEY:Skinwalker ~ Change Shape		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skinwalker Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:(5 RP): A skinwalker can change shape into a bestial form as a standard action. In bestial form, a skinwalker gains a +2 racial bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. While in this form, a skinwalker also takes on an animalistic feature that provides a special effect. Each time a skinwalker assumes bestial form, she can choose to gain one of the following features: * 2 claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage * Darkvision to a range of6o feet * +1 racial bonus to natural armor. The racial ability score bonus and additional feature last as long as the skinwalker remains in that form, and a skinwalker can remain in bestial form for as long as she wants. While in bestial form, a skinwalker takes a -4 penalty on Charisma and Charisma-based checks when interacting with humanoids that lack the shapechanger subtype. A skinwalker can return to her humanoid form as a swift action. To change forms and gain a different benefit, a skinwalker must first return to her humanoid form then use her shapechange ability again. A skinwalker can shapechange into bestial form a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her character level. Different skinwalker heritages (see Skinwalker Heritages on page 5) allow skinwalker characters to select from different sets of bestial features.	SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Aquatic Agility		KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Aquatic Agility		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PRECLASS:1,Magus=6	DESC:As an immediate action, the magus can spend 1 point from his arcane pool to gain the benefits of water breathing for %1 rounds. During this time, he can ignore the effects of rough water and underwater combat on his attacks and movement. The magus must be at least 6th level before selecting this magus arcana.|MagusArcanaLVL																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Arcane Scent		KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Arcane Scent		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The magus can sniff out other spellcasters. By spending 1 point from his arcane pool, the magus gains the scent special quality for %1 hours. This scent can only detect creatures capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities. Additionally, while this effect persists, the magus can attempt a Spellcraft check as a move action to determine the highest level spell a detected creature is capable of casting (DC = 10 + the creature's caster level). The magus can only attempt this Spellcrafi check once per creature per 24 hours.|MagusArcanaLVL																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Natural Spell Combat	KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Natural Spell Combat	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The magus can use his spell combat class feature with a natural attack of his choice. If he does, he gains a +2 bonus on concentration checks. If the natural attack is made with an appendage that would normally hold a weapon (such as a claw attack), the magus cannot wield a weapon in that appendage while making natural attacks with it. If the natural attack is a bite or other attack that does not require a free appendage to make, the magus can use the natural attack in addition to all of the attacks he could make with his melee weapon, if he has one. A magus can select this arcana more than once. The bonus on concentration checks does not stack. Each time he selects this arcana, he selects another natural weapon. For example, a magus could select this arcana twice, choosing claw attacks and bite attacks. This would allow him to use a full-round action to make all of his claw attacks with his free hand and all of his bite attacks in addition to casting a spell. This arcana otherwise functions exactly like the spell combat class feature.	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFICIENCY|TYPE=Natural	SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Spell Trickery		KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Spell Trickery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	PRECLASS:1,Magus=12	DESC:When the magus successfully performs a dirty trick combat maneuver, he can cast an illusion or enchantment spell he has prepared with a casting time of 1 standard action or less as a swift action. The magus can use this ability once per day. The magus must be at least 12th level before selecting this magus arcana.																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Spell-Scars			KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Spell-Scars		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The magus can use special scar-based tattoos called spell-scars on his skin to cast or prepare spells, much like scrolls. He can cast a spell from a spell-scar exactly like casting from a scroll; the ink and scars vanish when the spell is cast. The magus can also prepare spells from his spell-scars without expending them, similar to a wizard using the Spell Mastery feat. The magus does not need to be able to see his spell-scar to use it. A magus has room on his skin for 18 total spell levels of spell-scars, which he can create using the rules for scribing scrolls (although they do not require the Scribe Scroll feat).
