Doing so causes the weapon to inf lict filth fever (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557) on its next strike. The rogue does not risk exposure to this disease unless she is damaged by the weapon. After a successful attack with the weapon, the filth is dispersed and must be reapplied.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.19

By spending 1 point from his arcane pool, the magus gains the scent special quality for %1 hours. This scent can only detect creatures capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities. Additionally, while this effect persists, the magus can attempt a Spellcraft check as a move action to determine the highest level spell a detected creature is capable of casting (DC = 10 + the creature's caster level). The magus can only attempt this Spellcrafi check once per creature per 24 hours.|MagusArcanaLVL																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Natural Spell Combat	KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Natural Spell Combat	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The magus can use his spell combat class feature with a natural attack of his choice. If he does, he gains a +2 bonus on concentration checks. If the natural attack is made with an appendage that would normally hold a weapon (such as a claw attack), the magus cannot wield a weapon in that appendage while making natural attacks with it. If the natural attack is a bite or other attack that does not require a free appendage to make, the magus can use the natural attack in addition to all of the attacks he could make with his melee weapon, if he has one. A magus can select this arcana more than once. The bonus on concentration checks does not stack. Each time he selects this arcana, he selects another natural weapon. For example, a magus could select this arcana twice, choosing claw attacks and bite attacks. This would allow him to use a full-round action to make all of his claw attacks with his free hand and all of his bite attacks in addition to casting a spell. This arcana otherwise functions exactly like the spell combat class feature.	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFICIENCY|TYPE=Natural	SOURCEPAGE:p.21

Spell-Scars			KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Spell-Scars		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The magus can use special scar-based tattoos called spell-scars on his skin to cast or prepare spells, much like scrolls. He can cast a spell from a spell-scar exactly like casting from a scroll; the ink and scars vanish when the spell is cast. The magus can also prepare spells from his spell-scars without expending them, similar to a wizard using the Spell Mastery feat. The magus does not need to be able to see his spell-scar to use it. A magus has room on his skin for 18 total spell levels of spell-scars, which he can create using the rules for scribing scrolls (although they do not require the Scribe Scroll feat).
