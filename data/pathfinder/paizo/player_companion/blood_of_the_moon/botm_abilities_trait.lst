Change Shape		KEY:Skinwalker ~ Change Shape		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skinwalker Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:(5 RP): A skinwalker can change shape into a bestial form as a standard action. In bestial form, a skinwalker gains a +2 racial bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. While in this form, a skinwalker also takes on an animalistic feature that provides a special effect. Each time a skinwalker assumes bestial form, she can choose to gain one of the following features: • 2 claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage • Darkvision to a range of6o feet • +1 racial bonus to natural armor The racial ability score bonus and additional feature last as long as the skinwalker remains in that form, and a skinwalker can remain in bestial form for as long as she wants. While in bestial form, a skinwalker takes a -4 penalty on Charisma and Charisma-based checks when interacting with humanoids that lack the shapechanger subtype. A skinwalker can return to her humanoid form as a swift action. To change forms and gain a different benefit, a skinwalker must first return to her humanoid form then use her shapechange ability again. A skinwalker can shapechange into bestial form a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her character level. Different skinwalker heritages (see Skinwalker Heritages on page 5) allow skinwalker characters to select from different sets of bestial features.

Face in the Crowd	KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Face in the Crowd	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueTalent.RogueClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:A rogue with this talent can blend into groups easily.

PRECLASS:1,Magus=6
Arcane Scent		KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Arcane Scent		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	DESC:The magus can sniff out other spellcasters.

If the natural attack is made with an appendage that would normally hold a weapon (such as a claw attack), the magus cannot wield a weapon in that appendage while making natural attacks with it. If the natural attack is a bite or other attack that does not require a free appendage to make, the magus can use the natural attack in addition to all of the attacks he could make with his melee weapon, if he has one. A magus can select this arcana more than once. The bonus on concentration checks does not stack. Each time he selects this arcana, he selects another natural weapon. For example, a magus could select this arcana twice, choosing claw attacks and bite attacks. This would allow him to use a full-round action to make all of his claw attacks with his free hand and all of his bite attacks in addition to casting a spell.

Spell-Scars			KEY:Magus Arcana ~ Spell-Scars		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusArcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	DESC:The magus can use special scar-based tattoos called spell-scars on his skin to cast or prepare spells, much like scrolls. He can cast a spell from a spell-scar exactly like casting from a scroll; the ink and scars vanish when the spell is cast. The magus can also prepare spells from his spell-scars without expending them, similar to a wizard using the Spell Mastery feat. The magus does not need to be able to see his spell-scar to use it. A magus has room on his skin for 18 total spell levels of spell-scars, which he can create using the rules for scribing scrolls (although they do not require the Scribe Scroll feat).
