# Spell Name			Unique Key						Type				Classes of caster											School			Sub-School			Components		Casting Time			Range			Target Area or Effect						Duration											Save Info					Spell Resistance		Source Page		Description
Cheetah's Sprint										TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Ranger,Shaman,Witch=1						SCHOOL:Transmutation					COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:1 round																				SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:A wild surge of energy courses through your body and propels you into a sprint. If you take a charge or run action before the end of your turn, you can move a total distance of up to 10 times your base land speed. This adjustment is an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with other effects that increase your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance.
Clear Grove											TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Ranger=2|Druid,Shaman,Witch=3							SCHOOL:Transmutation					COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius clearing				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*2) hours [D]							SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:Trees, shrubs, and other thick vegetation move out of the spell's area. The affected area is cleared of all vegetation thick enough to provide cover or concealment. This also creates a hole in any tree canopy, allowing sunlight to pass through. Affected trees and undergrowth form a 5-foot-wide ring along the edge of the clearing, which may provide cover or concealment based on the thickness of the vegetation (at the GM's discretion). This spell doesn't affect creatures of the plant type. The spell can affect vegetation altered with spells of equal or lower level (such as entangle or spike growth). When the spell ends, the trees and undergrowth move back to their original places unless they're destroyed or somehow restrained (the amount of time this takes is subject to the GM's discretion).
Globe of Tranquil Water									TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Shaman,Witch=4|Sorcerer,Wizard=5					SCHOOL:Abjuration						COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:20 ft.	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]							SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:Upon casting this spell, a rippling bubble of calm water extends outward from you to a radius of 20 feet and remains centered on you when you move. The bubble blocks all natural and magical precipitation such as rain, snow, and hail (including spells such as ice storm). This bubble also pushes out any fog or mist within the area, though it does not affect temperature and can't block natural or magical lightning. All water in this radius counts as calm water for the purposes of Swim checks, and the bubble prevents sprays and blasts of mundane and magic water from striking with enough force to deal damage, move creatures or halt their movement, or perform any action that requires an attack roll or combat maneuver check. Water elementals are affected by a globe of tranquil water the same way creatures of the plant type are affected by an antiplant shell.
Nature's Paths										TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Inquisitor,Ranger,Shaman,Witch=1					SCHOOL:Divination						COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One creature						DURATION:8 hours [D]									SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:The target instinctively knows the shortest, easiest, and fastest way through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the target treats any trackless terrain as though there were a trail or road, and any terrain with a road or trail as though there were a highway. Up to %1 creatures traveling with the target can also benefit from the effect. The spell functions only outdoors and does not function in magically altered terrain.|CASTERLEVEL
Oasis												TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid=5|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6							SCHOOL:Transmutation					COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:30 minutes		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Water source similar to a natural spring	DURATION:Instantaneous									SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:This spell functions in any natural terrain on the Material Plane. It redirects the flow of water in the ground toward the surface at the designated point, creating a permanent water source similar to a natural spring. The spring discharges %1 gallons of pure drinking water each hour. If the shape of the terrain is suitable, a pond forms around the spring. If there is already a natural spring within 1 mile, its water output is reduced by an amount equal to the water produced by this spell's spring. A spring that has its water output reduced to 0 gallons per hour dries up and ceases to be a spring. This spell functions differently depending on the terrain in which it's cast.|CASTERLEVEL*5
Planar Refuge										TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Summoner=6|Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Shaman,Witch,Wizard=7			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:50-ft.-radius area of safe environment	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days								SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:This spell enforces the rules of the Material Plane on other planes of existence. Upon casting this spell on another plane, a spherical pocket of wilderness terrain forms around the designated point. The affected area defies the local climate and planar traits, suppressing any harmful environmental effects such as toxicity, extreme temperatures, or lack of air (though this spell doesn't affect gravity). The area also becomes lush with edible plants whose appearance, taste, and smell bear characteristics distinct to the environment. Though planar refuge can be cast on any plane of existence other than the Material Plane, it requires a body of solid matter at least as large as its area to function.
Raven's Flight										TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Inquisitor=3|Magus,Ranger,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation					COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:1 round																				SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You can cast this spell only if it is the first action you take on your turn. In a burst of shadowy feathers, you turn into a Tiny blurred shape reminiscent of a black raven until the beginning of your next turn. You gain a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, and apply appropriate size modifiers (though your ability scores don't change). Until the beginning of your next turn, you can take only the 5-foot step, move, run, or withdraw actions. If the spell is dispelled while you are still aloft, the power of flight dissipates slowly; you float downward 60 feet on your next turn, then fall any remaining distance.
Wild Instinct										TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Ranger,Shaman=2							SCHOOL:Divination						COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:8 hours																				SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:This spell sharpens your senses, allowing you to perceive threats you would otherwise miss. You become aware of sounds and smells you would normally overlook, and even retain the ability to detect threats when soundly asleep. For the duration of the spell, you gain a +5 bonus on Perception checks to act in a surprise round. Additionally, you don't take a penalty on Perception checks while sleeping, and can choose to wake if you notice a threat while asleep.

Summon Nature's Ally I		KEY:Wild Caller Summon Nature's Ally I	TYPE:Arcane																SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One summoned creature				DURATION:(ConjurationSummonersCharmBonus+(CASTERLEVEL)) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.350	DESC:This spell summons an extraplanar creature.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:This spell summons an extraplanar creature [typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane]. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-5. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. A summoned nature's ally cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components [such as wish]. When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10-5 marked with an "*" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an "*" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. [Table Not Included]|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
