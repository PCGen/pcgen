Ascendant					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:You must have the Secret Shame drawback (page 7) or the Bastard-Born background (Ultimate Campaign p.20), and you must also have no publicly known faults or made any indisputable mistakes that could humiliate or cast down a figure of high station.																	DESC:You seek unquestioning admiration and respect to escape from a shameful past.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:You and your apparent allies gain a +2 bonus on skill checks to gain influence (Ultimate Intrigue p.102) or request a favor. This bonus no longer applies on checks against a person or organization once you fail a skill check to gain influence over or request a favor from that person or organization. Additionally, the DC of Sense Motive checks to get hunches about you and your apparent allies increases by 2. [Goal] Achieve a position in a high social class (such as the nobility) or an esteemed military position (such as general) without any substantiated rumors impugning your reputation. If your secret is exposed, you can replace this feat with Redemption after 1 month without meeting that feat's prerequisite. [Completion Benefit] You no longer lose this feat's bonus for failing a skill check. Your Bluff checks to maintain a good reputation are always at worst unlikely (if not believable), and Bluff checks attempted by others to spoil your reputation are always at best unlikely (if not harder to believe).
Conciliator					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:Must have successfully requested that the opposing sides of a violent encounter pause for parley.																																										DESC:You have witnessed terrible violence and prefer a better way.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:You can attempt a Diplomacy check to make a request of an enemy even if he is unfriendly or hostile, but only to request a pause in combat (which requires you and your apparent allies to take no attacks or hostile actions for 1 round prior to the request) or to request that he uses only nonlethal attacks (which requires you and your apparent allies to have made no attacks or used only nonlethal attacks against him for the past 24 hours). The DC is equal to 15 + the target's CR + the target's Wisdom modifier; it is modified by any other factors that would impact a Diplomacy check to make a request. Additionally, your allies within 30 feet who can see or hear you gain a +2 bonus on skill checks to analyze individuals while attempting to gain influence (Ultimate Intrigue p.102) or assess an audience before a verbal duel (Ultimate Intrigue p.176). Once an ally benefits from this feat, that ally can't do so again for 1 day. [Goal] Thwart an appropriate number of challenging foes with dialogue, nonviolent favors, and verbal duels. [Completion Benefit] Your allies can benefit from this feat any number of times per day.
Golden League Tattoos			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	NAMEISPI:YES																																										PRETEXT:Regional trait associated with one of the Dragon Empires nations (Pathfinder Player Companion: Dragon Empires Primer).																																						DESC:You have quite the impressive collection of tattoos that commemorate your connection to and achievements within the Golden League.																																				DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You have an impressive collection of tattoos, which are visible unless you wear concealing clothing or succeed at a DC 10 Disguise check. You can take 10 on Intimidate checks against creatures able to see your tattoos, even when stress or distractions would normally prevent you from doing so. You add Knowledge (local) to the skills associated with the presence tactic for verbal duels (Ultimate Intrigue), and the first time you win an exchange with that tactic you do not take a penalty on associated skill checks if you repeat the tactic in the same duel.
Inerrant Justice				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:Must have witnessed or suffered a grave injustice that went unpunished, or have the An Eye for an Eye or the Raiders background (Ultimate Campaign pages 38 and 24, respectively). If the offender is not a challenging foe, it either advances to become one or allies with one or more creatures who are.								DESC:You will punish the guilty without letting any innocents be harmed as a result.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can choose to take the maximum possible weapon damage die roll rather than rolling when you hit a foe that is unaware of you or considers you an ally. Bonus dice, including from sneak attack, surprise attack, and Vital Strike, are rolled normally. [Goal] Decisively defeat or slay the offender without killing any innocents in the process. You can complete the goal after killing innocents if you receive an atonement spell. [Completion Benefit] You can use this feat's benefit once per combat.
Infiltrator					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:Must have adopted an assumed or secret identity associated with an enemy organization.																																												DESC:You have sacrificed your true identity in order to achieve your goal.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Once per day when you succeed at a saving throw to negate a divination, you learn what the divination would have revealed and can spend an immediate action to cause the divination to return appropriate false information you imagine that would fit with your cover identity. [Goal] Thwart the organization you have infiltrated, defeating or turning to your cause an appropriate number of challenging foes in the process. [Completion Benefit] Whenever a spell or spell-like ability would reveal information about you, you can attempt a Will saving throw. If your saving throw is successful, the spell reveals nothing about you. You can use this feat's benefits to instead give false information, as detailed above.
Magical Enigma				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:Bloodline, eidolon, mystery, phantom, spirit animal, or witch's familiar class feature and you must have an unknown secret about your magic or family history (even if you do not yet know the topic of the secret) or have the One of a Kind, the Outsider's Lineage, or the Unknown background (Ultimate Campaign pages 40, 41 and 42, respectively).	DESC:A troubling mystery lurks around you, tied to the origin of your magic or your family's legacy, and you seek the truth at all costs.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:Select a class feature from the following list: one bloodline power, eidolon evolutions, one revelation, phantom abilities, spirit animal, or witch's familiar. The feature must be from a class you have at least 1 level in, and you must have the class feature. You can treat either your class level as being 1 higher, or your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score as 2 higher, for the purpose of calculating the effect of the selected power. This impacts only the calculations of your existing powers that are based on class level or the appropriate ability score. It does not grant you early access to abilities gained at higher levels. [Goal] Learn and verify the chosen magic secret for your family, defeating a challenging foe in the process. [Completion Benefit] Select one Knowledge skill or the Use Magic Device skill. This is now a class skill for you.
Puppet Master				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:You must have survived an encounter with a challenging foe without suffering significant harm by striking a deal (regardless of whether the deal was with the challenging foe or not), or have the Boss, the Liege Lord, or the Well-Connected Friend background (Ultimate Campaign pages 44, 44 and 45, respectively).						DESC:You crave power you can wield without drawing attention to yourself.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:If you succeed at a Diplomacy check to make a request of a creature by 5 or more, the DCs of additional requests you attempt increase by 1 per request, rather than 5. [Goal] Either thwart or decisively defeat an appropriate number of challenging foes as a direct result of bargains you have struck or control at least three leaders of settlements of at least 2,000 residents or similarly influential administrators for at least 6 months without being publicly exposed. [Completion Benefit] If you succeed at a Diplomacy check to make a request of a creature, the DCs of additional requests you attempt increase by 1 per request, rather than 5.
Pure Legion Assault			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		NAMEISPI:YES	PRESKILL:2,Bluff=1,Knowledge (religion)=1				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Pure Legion Recruit																																																																																DESC:The Pure Legion trained you to apply your knowledge of religions to predicting and defeating divine servitors.																																							DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against divine spells and effects and abilities from outsiders. If you must attempt a saving throw against a divine spell, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against the creature that cast the spell.
Rival						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:You must have at least one enemy who wishes to outdo you. If you have multiple rivals, the GM may keep the specific rival secret, or have many of your enemies work together against you. If your rival is not already a challenging foe, it either advances to become one or allies itself with others one or more creatures who are.				DESC:You have a rival, and the two of you try to sabotage, humiliate, or otherwise defeat each other without allowing anyone else to interfere.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:Your striving pushes you to become ever more skillful. When you gain this feat, and every 2 character levels thereafter, either you gain 1 skill point or your Fame score increases by 1 (if your game uses the reputation and Fame system from Ultimate Campaign). [Goal] Thwart your rival without anyone else directly interfering. Achieving your rival's goal before her in a manner that humiliates her or completely steals her glory through your direct actions also qualifies. [Completion Benefit] Once per day, you can take 20 on a single skill check as a standard action if the skill check is one that would allow you to take 20. [Special] Thwarting you becomes an all-consuming goal for your rival. Your rival gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks, saving throws, and skill checks against you. Your rival attempts to steal or undermine accomplishments which you strive to achieve.
Sense Loyalties				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General				PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (nobility)=1,Knowledge (religion)=1																																																																																											DESC:You can quickly sense a target's relationship to some specific god, patron, or government, and use that knowledge to manipulate them.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:After 1 hour or more of interaction, you can attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive check to get a hunch in order to intuit what god, government, leader, or patron a creature is loyal to or worships. You must understand the language the creature is speaking, and if it's of a different type than you, you take a –5 penalty on the check. If the creature is attempting to conceal its loyalties, it attempts a Bluff check. If the result of the Bluff check is higher than 20, that result becomes the DC of your Sense Motive check. On a success, you learn whether the creature has a patron god, a witch patron, or a government to which it is strongly loyal. You can attempt to name one specific god, patron, or government for every 2 ranks you have in Sense Motive by introducing them into the conversation as subjects, as noted below. You can use this ability only if you observe the creature in an environment where loyalty to a god, government, leader, or patron is being discussed. If this isn't already occurring, you can introduce the topic, but doing so may expose your interest. In this case, the creature you are observing and any other creatures able to hear you bring up the topic of loyalty to a god, government, leader, or patron can attempt Sense Motive checks (opposed by a Bluff check from you, which the GM rolls in secret). On a success, the creature realizes you are interested in determining the observed creature's specific loyalty. If you are attempting to determine whether the observed creature's loyalty is to a specific god, government, or leader as noted above, creatures who succeed at the Sense Motive check are aware of the specific god, government, leader, or patron about which you are interesting in learning.
Supernatural Spy				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:Alchemist discovery, arcane discovery, arcanist exploit, or magus arcana class feature and you must either have observed a created magical effect you could not understand or have the Master Craftsman UCA or the Unquenchable Hunger for Knowledge UCA background (Ultimate Campaign pages 25 and 43, respectively).						DESC:Your familiarity with magic drives you to discover a great supernatural secret. You might work with an eldritch organization, which could be a school of magic such as the Arcanamirium or part of a government with strong ties to magic such as that of Irrisen, or you might attempt to keep your magical inquiries hidden from your employers.				SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:Treat your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score as 2 higher for the purpose of calculating the effects and save DCs of one of the following class features: alchemist discoveries, arcane discoveries, arcanist exploits, or magus arcana. You select both the ability score and class feature to be affected when you select this feat, and the choice cannot be changed. This increases the potency of the abilities but does not grant access to additional abilities. [Goal] Learn a great supernatural secret, connected in some manner to an aspect of the class feature you selected with this story feat. You must evade or thwart a challenging foe in the process. [Completion Benefit] When calculating the effect of the class feature selected with this feat, you treat your class level for the relevant class as 2 higher. This does not impact when you gain access to additional abilities tied to that class feature, only the effectiveness of abilities from the feature you already have.
Wily Warrior				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Story																																														PRETEXT:Bluff 1 rank, Sense Motive 1 rank, base attack bonus +1, or you must have the Military Strategist background (page 5).																																						DESC:Those who observe your imposing demeanor assume muscle is your sole advantage, but you prove them wrong every time.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can use your ranks in Sense Motive in place of your total Will saving throw modifier when attempting a Will save. You must decide to use this ability prior to attempting the saving throw. [Goal] Thwart an appropriate number of challenging foes after getting a negative hunch about them when they attempted to deceive you or after ambushing them. [Completion Benefit] The DC of Bluff and Intimidate checks attempted against you increase by 5.

Discovery (Observant Illusion)	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus.Supernatural	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=9	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You can project your senses into any ongoing figment or shadow illusion you create with a spell of at least 3rd level. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a swift or move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.
