Claim Identity						TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Bard,Inquisitor,Witch=3|Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=4			SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph							COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Humanoid creature touched								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.28				DESC:You steal the target's face, transforming yourself into a flawless imitation of it. All of the target's facial features, vocal cues, and identifying physical traits change, transforming it into an unremarkable member of its race and gender. You transform into a perfect likeness of the target's true form, as if affected by alter self, and gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the original subject of this spell; you take no penalties on this check if the original target is of a different race, age, size, or gender. Claim identity prevents any other polymorph effects from restoring the target's true face for the spell's duration, though the target can still assume other forms or faces via magic or any natural shapechanging ability.
Claim Identity (Greater)				TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Antipaladin=4|Alchemist,Bard,Inquisitor,Witch=5|Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=6			SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph							COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Humanoid creature touched								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.28				DESC:This spell functions as per claim identity, except it transforms its target into a helpless, inanimate porcelain mask for the spell's duration. The target remains aware of everything it can see or hear while transformed. The target can't speak or move, but can still take purely mental actions (such as casting certain spells) or be targeted by spells that affect its mind. Any creature donning this mask is transformed into a flawless imitation of the spell's target, as if affected by claim identity, and reverts to its natural form upon removing the mask. Any damage dealt to the mask immediately ends this spell. [Material Component] a silver needle costing 100 gp.
Egorian Diplomacy			NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Magus,Mesmerist,Psychic=1								SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature											DURATION:Instant; see text				SAVEINFO:Will negates		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate skill check to make a target act friendly toward you. If you succeed, the target assists you normally, but Egorian diplomacy clouds the memory of any threats or pressure you applied. The target remembers assisting you, but can't remember why, and its attitude toward you doesn't worsen as a result of being intimidated. Whether a creature fails or succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to further castings of Egorian diplomacy for 24 hours.
Garrulous Grin						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Inquisitor,Mesmerist,Psychic,Shaman,Spiritualist=2|Witch=3				SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Fear|Mind-Affecting	COMPS:S		CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]			SAVEINFO:Will negates		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.28				DESC:This spell plants a seed of supernatural fear deep in a subject's mind, causing self-doubt, stuttering, and evasiveness. Affected creatures have difficulty meeting anyone's gaze and seem dishonest or guilty. The target takes a -4 penalty on Bluff and\ Diplomacy checks to convince another of the truth of her words, and on Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to influence another creature's attitude.
Insect Scouts						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Shaman=2|Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=3|Antipaladin,Bard,Psychic=4	SCHOOL:Divination												COMPS:S,M		CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL/4) insect scouts								DURATION:1d6+(CASTERLEVEL) hours; see text	SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.29				DESC:Insect scouts summons one or more vermin to investigate a single location or building you can see. Your scouts must spend 1d6 hours investigating the target location, but need no oversight. When done, they return unerringly to you with their findings, traveling up to (CASTERLEVEL) miles to rejoin their master. Each insect's size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus of (5+CASTERLEVEL/2), and can't attack. Because of their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus of (18+CASTERLEVEL/2). Each scout that returns passes along memories of specific structural flaws, defenses, and alarms, granting you the ability to reroll one failed skill check per scout, as long as the skill check involves that specific location's layout, such as a Stealth check to sneak in, a Disable Device check to silence an alarm, or a Perception check to notice a trap. If even one scout returns, you also gain a rough understanding of the building's layout (at least, any portions your scouts could access). All insight (and the associated rerolls) fades (CASTERLEVEL) hours after the scouts return. Your insects remember nothing about creatures, and so provide no information about guardians or any conversations they may overhear.
Passing Fancy						TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2								SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature									DURATION:4d4 rounds [D]					SAVEINFO:Will negates		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.29				DESC:When you cast the spell, you dictate one specific topic or recent event and instill a magical obsession with that subject within the target. An affected creature becomes fascinated by the topic, and becomes completely focused on discussing the event with anyone nearby, possibly wandering off or distracting unaffected creatures. Passing fancy has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence of 2 or less. Because the target talks and interacts with its usual cadence, onlookers take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to notice that anything is amiss with the target's behavior.
Passing Fancy (Mass)					TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist=5|Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6								SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:4d4 rounds [D]					SAVEINFO:Will negates		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.29				DESC:When you cast the spell, you dictate one specific topic or recent event and instill a magical obsession with that subject within the targets. An affected creature becomes fascinated by the topic, and becomes completely focused on discussing the event with anyone nearby, possibly wandering off or distracting unaffected creatures. Passing fancy has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence of 2 or less. Because a target talks and interacts with its usual cadence, onlookers take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to notice that anything is amiss with the target's behavior.
Scribe's Binding						TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Occultist=6|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9										SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph							COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Creature touched										DURATION:Permanent					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.29				DESC:This spell binds a single creature into a prepared book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience and knowledge. The tome weighs 10 pounds and has one page for every day of the subject's life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject's appearance, interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory-including those the target may have forgotten long ago-are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages, penned in excruciating detail in the language that the creature was thinking or speaking in when the event occurred. If a memory includes dialogue in a language the subject didn't understand, that dialogue is reproduced phonetically, and must be translated by a reader who knows that language. Any alterations to a subject's memories-such as by a modify memory spell-appear in a subtly different script; a successful DC 35 Linguistics check is needed to identify this. Spells that modify or remove text-such as erase or secret page-also affect the target's memory if they persist after its release. Modify memory can be used to repair any changes to its original state, or alter the accounts recorded within the book. A creature imprisoned by scribe's binding automatically fails any saving throws against effects to change or modify its memories. A target bound by this spell can be freed by only freedom, miracle, or wish. Polymorph any object restores the target's normal form for 24 hours. Scribe's binding makes the imprisoning tome supernaturally durable (hardness 20, 10 hp per HD the imprisoned creature had). Destroying the tome immediately slays the creature imprisoned within. [Focus] a book bound in precious metals and treated with rare oils, worth 1,000 gp per HD of the target
Trial by Fire						TYPE:Divine				CLASSES:Antipaladin,Cleric,Inquisitor,Paladin=3										SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Fire				COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched										DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.22				DESC:You test a creature's purity of convictions by exposing it to a sheet of divine fire. Unless the target's alignment is within one step of your deity's, the spell deals (min(5,CASTERLEVEL/2))d6 points of damage. Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. Additionally, if the target has an element of its alignment that is in direct opposition to your deity's (chaos opposes law and evil opposes good), you can also attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a free action.
Watchful Animal						TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4									SCHOOL:Divination		SUBSCHOOL:Scrying								COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Magical sensor										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes			SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.22				DESC:You place a scrying sensor on your animal companion or familiar. This allows the animal companion or familiar to function as if it were an insect summoned by the greater insect spy spell. The animal companion or familiar does not change shape, nor does it lose the ability to make its own decisions, but it receives orders and gives answers as per insects summoned by that spell, and you can sense its direction and distance and receive sensory input from it as with that spell.
