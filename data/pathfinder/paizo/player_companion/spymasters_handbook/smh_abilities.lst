His social identity remains his true form, and unlike with beast shape I, an agathiel can remain in his animal form indefinitely. The agathiel's vigilante identity is considered a polymorph effect, and while in his vigilante identity, the agathiel is immune to other polymorph effects. Unlike with normal polymorph effects, the agathiel's equipment does not meld into his form, and instead changes shape to fit his animal form and provides the same function, though any equipment requiring hands cannot be used until he returns to his social identity.|PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=4	DESC:When assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select two abilities provided by beast shape I, or select a single ability provided by beast shape II.|PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=8|!PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=12	DESC:When assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select two abilities provided by beast shape II, or a single ability provided by beast shape III.|PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=12|!PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=16	DESC:When assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select three abilities provided by beast shape III, or a single ability provided by beast shape IV.|PRECLASS:1,Vigilante=16	DESC:This ability alters dual identity.
