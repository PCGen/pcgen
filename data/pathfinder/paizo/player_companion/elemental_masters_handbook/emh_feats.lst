Benthic Spell						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																					ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:Explorers in the depths of the Arcadian Ocean have learned that deadly pressure can be just as lethal as any flame.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:You can modify a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to deal damage through high-pressure water instead. The spell gains the water descriptor, and you can either replace the spell's normal damage with bludgeoning damage or split the spell's damage so that half is bludgeoning and half is of its normal type. Creatures with damage reduction apply their damage reduction to bludgeoning damage from a benthic spell, but the spell counts as bludgeoning and magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. A benthic spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Bilge Rat							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																											DESC:Keeping a sailing vessel afloat means moving constantly between bright sunlight and darkened holds. You wear an eye patch, out of convenience rather than necessity, to make one of your eyes used to the dark and the other to the light.		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:If you are wearing an eye patch when you are dazzled or blinded as a result of eye damage or a visual stimulus (such as from fireworks or a glitterdust spell), you can remove or switch your eye patch as a move action to favor the eye you had kept covered. Switching your eye patch allows you to ignore the dazzled condition or to reduce the blinded condition to dazzled until the effect ends, at which time you regain the ability to use this feat.
Brackish Spell						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																											DESC:You can conjure a seawater orb to protect yourself.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:This feat can be applied only to spells with the water descriptor. You can modify the spell to surround you with a thin sheath of brackish salt water in addition to the spell's normal effect. You gain DR/piercing equal to the spell's level for 1 round after you finish casting the spell. After this round, the water collapses into a briny puddle and the effect ends. A brackish spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.
Flumefire Rage						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CHA,15	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=Bloodrage,Kineticist ~ Elemental Focus,Varisian Tattoo ~ Ragario																		PRETEXT:Cha 15; bloodrage class feature, elemental focus class feature, or Varisian Tattoo (evocation) (The Inner Sea World Guide p. 289).					DESCISPI:YES	DESC:Your meditation before a rune-engraved stone in the Flume Warrens unlocks the secret of its blazing flame.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:When casting an evocation spell that deals fire damage, you can deal +1 point of fire damage per die. If you do, you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + the spell or blast's level) or become fatigued. You cannot use this feat while fatigued or if you cannot become fatigued. If you are raging (such as when using bloodrage or affected by the rage spell), this damage increases to +2 points per die and you roll twice when attempting the Fortitude save and take the better result. This feat does not otherwise grant you the ability to cast spells while raging.
Growth in Ash						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																											DESC:You're aware that when fire passes, growth can begin.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.6	BENEFIT:When you succeed at a Reflex save to avoid catching on fire, or when you cease taking ongoing fire damage from a spell or effect, you can smear ash on yourself as an immediate action to gain fast healing 1 for 3 rounds. For every Hit Die you have beyond 3, extend the duration of this fast healing by an additional round.
Hammer Guards the Anvil					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Teamwork																																																																											DESC:Your allies cover you when your guard is down.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:Creatures threatened by an ally with this feat cannot make attacks of opportunity against you when you pick up an item from the ground, retrieve a stored item, sheathe a weapon, or stand up from prone.
Hurricane Punch						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_STR,13	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=Feat,Improved Bull Rush,Improved Unarmed Strike,Power Attack																						PRETEXT:Str 13, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack.																			DESC:Your fast strikes hit with the force of a hurricane, pushing your foes away.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:When you hit the same creature with unarmed strikes at least twice in the same round, you can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that creature as a swift action. You can also move with the target even if you have no movement remaining, but the distance you move can't exceed half your speed.
Improved Elemental Counterspell			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=Simple Blast	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Expanded Element,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																PRETEXT:Two basic blast wild talents from two different elements, expanded element class feature, kinetic blast class feature.										DESC:You can charge your kinetic blast with disruptive elemental energy that tears apart elemental spells.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You can use a readied kinetic blast to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level, provided that the target spell has any of the following descriptors: air, cold, darkness, earth, electricity, fire, force, light, or water. [Normal] A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell spells that share its descriptor.
Joyless Toil						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13	PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_WIS,13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike	PRETOTALAB:8																		PRETEXT:Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.																				DESC:Your strikes render your enemy distracted and unable to focus on productive action.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.11	BENEFIT:Joyless Toil forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1) in addition to taking damage normally. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll—thus, a failed attack roll wastes the attempt. An opponent who fails this saving throw is nauseated for 1 round or until the opponent is attacked. You can attempt to use Joyless Toil %2 times per day, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.|10+TL/2+WIS|TL/4
Kraggodan's Stance		NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,13	PREMULT:1,[PREPROFWITHARMOR:1,TYPE.Heavy],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Armor Proficiency (Heavy)]	PREMULT:1,[PREPROFWITHSHIELD:1,TYPE.Tower,TYPE.Heavy],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shield Proficiency]		PRETEXT:Con 13, proficiency with heavy armor and shields.																			DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You have learned one of the secrets of Kraggodan's defenders and can lock your armor and shield into an impenetrable barrier.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.11	BENEFIT:As a move action when wearing heavy armor and using a heavy shield or tower shield, you increase the bonus to AC granted by your armor and your shield by 1 each until you move or are moved from your current square. You must be in contact with solid ground to gain this benefit. You can never increase an armor or shield bonus to AC by more than 1 each in this way.
Mountain Eyes						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Perception=5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Blind-Fight																														PRETEXT:Blind-Fight, Perception 5 ranks.																									DESC:Your gaze cuts through vapors with ease.																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:You ignore concealment (but not total concealment) caused by fog, rain, smoke, wind, and other gases or weather effects (including magical effects like obscuring mist), and you ignore up to –4 in penalties on Perception checks from such effects. You treat total concealment resulting from any such gas or weather effects within 10 feet of you as concealment (20%% miss chance).
Stone-Handed						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_STR,13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Stunning Fist																													PRETEXT:Str 13, Stunning Fist.																										DESC:Drawing upon techniques to combat animated creatures, you bring a strike like an avalanche of stone.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.10	BENEFIT:Before making a melee attack with an unarmed strike, you can expend one use of Stunning Fist to declare a stone-handed strike. Resolve the attack normally, except your attack ignores an amount of the target's hardness equal to your monk level or one-quarter your base attack bonus (minimum 1), whichever is higher. This effect replaces other effects or conditions that would be caused by your Stunning Fist.
Storm Breaker						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																								DESCISPI:YES	DESC:After the Eye of Abendego, no other storm, magic or mundane, can faze you.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:You are treated as two sizes larger than your actual size when calculating whether you can be moved by wind or currents, including the vortex and whirlwind special abilities of monsters. If you have at least 11 Hit Dice, you cannot be moved by nonmagical wind unless you so choose.
Sunblade							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Word of Healing	PRECLASS:1,Paladin=5	PREDEITYDOMAIN:1,Fire,Sun																									PRETEXT:Word of Healing, paladin level 5th, worshiper of a deity that grants the Fire or Sun domain.															DESC:You can channel your deity's solar wrath through your blade.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:You can expend a use of lay on hands as a standard action to launch a blast of flame from your weapon. This acts as the kineticist's fire blast (Occult Adventures p.15), with an effective kineticist level of %1. You do not need a free hand to use this ability, but you must be wielding a manufactured melee weapon. You use your Charisma modifier instead of your Constitution modifier to determine the blast's damage. This blast cannot be modified by infusions or other effects that specifically improve a kineticist's blast, even if you have them from other classes.|PaladinLVL-4
Tundra Stride						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=5																																						PRETEXT:Acrobatics 5 ranks.																											DESC:Whether as predator or prey, you have learned to move like the arctic wind when survival is at stake.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.18	BENEFIT:While charging, running, or withdrawing, you gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your base speed. This bonus also applies to your speed when calculating overland movement in any plains terrain. You lose the benefits of this feat while you are wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.
Wind Song							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Perform (Wind Instruments)=5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=BardicPerformance,TYPE=SkaldRagingSong																				PRETEXT:Perform (wind instruments) 5 ranks; bardic performance or raging song class feature.													DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You have learned to play haunting, captivating melodies similar to those of the eerie Painted Flutes canyon. Like an echo, the wind carries the sound and magic of your music much farther than it would normally reach.					SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:Three times per day while you are using a wind instrument to play a bardic performance or raging song, you can spend an extra round of performance at the start of your performance and choose a square within 120 feet. Strange echoes carry your music, and for the purpose of determining which creatures are affected by your performance, your performance counts as originating from that square rather than from your location. You cannot change the square from which the music originates until you end your performance. If you move beyond 120 feet from the chosen square, the performance immediately ends.
Mobile Gathering						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=7		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																										PRETEXT:Kineticist level 7th, kinetic blast class feature.																						DESC:You can gather elemental energy while walking slowly.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:While taking a move action to gather power, you can move up to half your base speed, and while taking 1 full round to gather power, you can move up to half your speed on the turn you begin the full round of gathering power. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity, and you can't use Acrobatics checks or other abilities to attempt to negate them, as you're concentrating on gathering power (nor can you use Acrobatics to balance, jump, or do anything else that requires a skill check). It's harder to concentrate on gathering power while using this feat; if you take damage during or after gathering power and before using a kinetic blast that releases it (including from an attack of opportunity provoked by the movement), the concentration check DC to avoid losing the gathered power increases by twice the blast's effective spell level.
