Blast of Wind.MOD				DESC:With a spiraling gesture of your hand and a forceful exhalation, you create a brief but fierce (90 mph) blast of wind. This spell functions as gust of wind, except all creatures within the area are treated as though they were one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the spell affects them. For every 4 caster levels beyond 7th, creatures in the area are treated as an additional size category smaller (to a maximum of three size categories smaller at 15th level).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Carrying Wind.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, a wind spirit envelopes you and carries you with it at your direction. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your base speed and fly speed while this spell is in effect. If you don't have a fly speed, you instead gain a fly speed of 10 feet with poor maneuverability. If your caster level is 10thâ€“14th, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +20 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 20 feet with average maneuverability). If your caster level is 15th or higher, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +30 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 30 feet with average maneuverability).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Expel Blood.MOD				DESC:You animate a portion of the target's blood, causing it to force itself out of the victim's body and form a corrupted water elemental. The target takes 2d4 points of Constitution damage unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, blood (or an analogous internal fluid, such as ichor) pours from the target's body and pools in an empty adjacent square of your choice. The fluids immediately form into a fiendish water elemental (Bestiary pp.294, 126) of the same size as the target (but not larger than a Large fiendish water elemental). This fiendish water elemental does not have the vortex ability, but it has the blood drain special attack (Bestiary 2 p.294), which deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage at the end of the water elemental's turn if it grapples a foe. The elemental gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat. You have no control over the fiendish water elemental once it is summoned, though the water elemental does not attack you under any circumstances. This spell does not affect creatures that are Small or smaller or those that don't have blood or some analogous internal fluid.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lightning Conductor.MOD			DESC:You become capable of absorbing electricity with your body. For the duration, you absorb all electricity damage dealt to you until you have stored a total of 18 points of damage. Any excess damage affects you as normally. The energy remains stored until it is expended or the spell expires. If you have at least 6 points of damage stored, you can expend all the energy stored in you as a swift action, charging your hand or a metal weapon in your hand. As a standard action while your hand is charged, you can make a melee touch attack that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, or you can shoot the energy as a ray with a range of 30 feet. If the attack hits, you deal 1d6 points of electricity damage for every 6 points stored and the energy is expended (any remaining points are wasted). A weapon charged with this energy deals the damage as extra damage the first time you score a hit with the weapon. If your hand or weapon is still charged at the end of your turn, or if the charged weapon leaves your hand before the end of the turn, the energy dissipates harmlessly. Once you have spent the absorbed energy, or if the absorbed energy dissipates, you can absorb more electricity damage. The maximum amount of damage you can store in your body at a time increases by 6 points for every 2 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of 60 points of damage at 19th level). If you are immune to electricity or have any amount of electricity resistance, you cannot absorb or expend energy with this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rising Water.MOD				DESC:You conjure a cylinder of calm water on an area of solid ground or on top of a body of water. The water forms quickly but displaces only air; it doesn't push away objects or creatures, though anything in the area when the spell is cast is submerged. Unconscious air-breathing creatures caught in the area immediately begin to drown, but other air-breathing creatures can hold their breath while in the cylinder. Movement through the cylinder at normal speed requires a successful DC 10 Swim check (otherwise, creatures move at one-quarter speed). If conjured in an area with insufficient room for the entire cylinder, the cylinder attains its maximum possible size. It retains its shape in defiance of gravity for the spell's duration, and any creature can enter or exit the cylinder's sides as easily as stepping into or out of a pool of ordinary water. The water disappears at the end of the spell's duration, so creatures swimming in the water immediately fall to the ground.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Second Wind.MOD				DESC:You can cast this spell only when you have fewer than one-quarter of your total hit points. With a gasping utterance, you summon invigorating air to fill your lungs. You heal 2d8+%1 points of damage. You can cast this spell either as a swift action on your turn or as an immediate action when you are brought to below 0 hit points. If you do not breathe, you can't benefit from this spell.|min(10,CASTERLEVEL)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Speak with Waves.MOD			DESC:This spell functions as stone tell but allows conversations only with a body of standing or flowing fresh water at least as large as you are. Flowing water can generally speak about events happening upstream but not events happening downstream.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spindrift Spritz.MOD			DESC:You can cast this spell only as a response to a target attempting a saving throw against an effect that would cause the fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered conditions. The target can roll its saving throw twice and take the higher result.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spindrift Spritz (Mass).MOD		DESC:You can cast this spell only as a response to one or more of the targets attempting a saving throw against an effect that would cause the fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered conditions. Each target can roll their saving throw twice and take the higher result.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Mist.MOD				DESC:With a whispered incantation, you conjure a stationary vertical wall of misty vapor. The wall is straight, is 1 foot thick, and has a length up to (CASTERLEVEL*10) feet. The wall obscures vision, granting concealment (20%% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall. A creature that shares a square with the wall counts as being on neither side of the wall and neither benefits nor suffers from the concealment. Alternatively, you can create a wall with increased density, but doing so reduces the maximum length of the wall to (CASTERLEVEL*5) feet. In addition to granting concealment, this denser wall also hinders movement. Any creature moving into or attempting to pass through the wall must succeed at a DC 15 Strength check or be entangled (and unable to move) until the start of its next turn. A creature that starts its turn in the wall can freely move within it or move out of the wall in either direction. Only a severe or stronger wind (31+ mph) disperses the wall, and it does so in 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Waterproof.MOD				DESC:This spell renders a touched object waterproof for the duration of the spell. The object must be no larger than (CASTERLEVEL*10) pounds. The spell protects the object from any mundane liquids (such as alcohol or oil) but not from magically created liquids. If this spell is cast on a creature, all of that creature's equipment is rendered waterproof as long as it is carried by the target creature. If the creature drops or discards an item, the item is no longer protected by this spell, even if the targeted creature picks it up later. Mundane combustibles under the effects of this spell still need exposure to air in order to ignite.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Elemental Speech (water only).MOD			DESC:This spell enables you to converse with creatures associated with water, including but not limited to true elemental creatures. Elemental speech does not guarantee a friendly reaction; it merely enables communication. You may converse with all appropriate creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or greater, even if they do not understand one another.  You can converse in Aquan and with any creature that has the water subtype or a swim speed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
