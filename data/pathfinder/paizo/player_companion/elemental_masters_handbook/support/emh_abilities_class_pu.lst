Binding Pool				KEY:Genie Binder ~ Binding Pool			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Genie Binder Class Features.ClassFeatures.Supernatural																																														DEFINE:GenieBinderPool|0				DESC:Using a combination of blackmail, contracts, magical finesse, and negotiation, a genie binder can command genies and channel their magic. A genie binder has a binding pool equal to twice her genie binder class level, and the pool recharges each day, typically after she gets a restful night's sleep. As a free action before attempting a Charisma check or Charisma-based skill check to interact with a genie, the genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool to add 1d6 to the result.

Elemental Seal				KEY:Genie Binder ~ Elemental Seal			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Genie Binder Class Features.ClassFeatures.Supernatural																																																						DESC:By expending 1 point from her binding pool, a genie binder can touch a creature or solid surface to create a powerful rune known as an elemental seal. At 1st level, a genie binder can create a seal of air. At 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels, she learns how to create seals of earth, fire, and water, respectively. Creating an elemental seal requires a standard action, and placing it on an unwilling target requires a successful melee touch attack. An elemental seal is a writing-based magical effect whose caster level is equal to the genie binder's character level, and any associated saving throw is %1. At 1st level, a genie binder can maintain only one elemental seal at a time. If she creates another seal beyond that limit, she chooses one of her seals to end immediately. Otherwise, an elemental seal lasts for 24 hours, and a genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool each day to extend the duration of an existing seal by 24 hours. An elemental seal has a different effect depending on whether it's placed on a genie, a non-genie creature, or a solid surface. If a genie binder places an elemental seal on a genie with a matching subtype (such as a seal of air on a djinni), the genie must succeed at a Will save or be affected by charm monster as long as the seal lasts. If a genie binder places an elemental seal on a non-genie creature, that creature gains several constant benefits, including resistance %2 to one energy type based on the seal's element. A seal of air grants electricity resistance and feather fall. A seal of earth grants acid resistance and barkskin. A seal of fire grants fire resistance and causes one weapon the creature wields to gain the flaming weapon special ability. A seal of water grants cold resistance, freedom of movement, and water breathing. When placed on a solid surface, an elemental seal functions as a glyph of warding. The seal can duplicate only the effects of a blast glyph and deals a specific type of damage based on the seal: acid (seal of earth), cold (seal of water), electricity (seal of air), or fire (seal of fire).|10+GenieBinderLVL/2+CHA|10*(1+(GenieBinderLVL>=5))																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Genie Mastery				KEY:Genie Binder ~ Genie Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Genie Binder Class Features.ClassFeatures.Supernatural																																																						DESC:A genie binder must decide whether to bind a genie minion or pursue spellcasting power. Once this decision is made, it can't be changed. If she selects a genie minion, she gains an eidolon with the genie subtype, treating her genie binder level as her effective summoner level; her genie binder levels stack with any summoner levels she has for this purpose, but only for an eidolon with the genie subtype. If she selects spellcasting, she gains the benefits of her aligned spellcasting class feature at 3rd level, in addition to the other indicated levels.

Each time she summons a genie in this way, she must expend 1 point from her binding pool, and summoned genies cannot cast wish.
