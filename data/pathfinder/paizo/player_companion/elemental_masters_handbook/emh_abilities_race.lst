Desperation				KEY:Emotional Focus ~ Desperation						SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 1	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus.SpecialQuality						SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:A phantom with this emotional focus died desperate and panicking—a victim of drowning, suffocation, or some other inexorable and traumatic death. The phantom relives its horrific demise over and over, futilely clawing at its foes to save itself and dragging them down with it. Desperation phantoms often hold power over water, though a phantom that died in a cave-in might display powers that are reminiscent of pressing rock instead. Desperation phantoms eschew coherent forms, usually appearing as a cloud of grasping hands and screaming faces. A blue-gray aura tends to surround these phantoms when they manifest.

Frantic Grip			KEY:Emotional Focus / Desperation ~ Frantic Grip			SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 2d	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus / Desperation.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:The phantom can add its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier to its combat maneuver bonus when attempting to grapple. When the phantom is below half its total hit points, it gains a +4 bonus on grapple attempts and to its CMD against grapple combat maneuvers.
Aura of Desperation		KEY:Emotional Focus / Desperation ~ Aura of Desperation		SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 2e	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus / Desperation.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:The phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that fills its foes with the sensation of drowning, suffocation, or another terrible impending death. It can activate this aura as a swift action. Enemies attempting to cast a spell with a verbal component within the aura must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + half the phantom's Hit Dice + the level of the spell being cast) or lose the spell. This is a mind-affecting effect. Deactivating the aura is a free action.
Clutch of Terror			KEY:Emotional Focus / Desperation ~ Clutch of Terror			SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 2f	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus / Desperation.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:The phantom can summon a mass of hands to grapple an enemy within 60 feet as a standard action. The hands immediately attempt a grapple combat maneuver against the target using the phantom's statistics (including the phantom's CMB), except the hands are collectively considered to be the same size as the target. On following rounds, the hands attempt to maintain the grapple (the hands cannot pin the target, however). Each round that the hands successfully grapple a target, the hands also deal the phantom's normal slam damage to the target. The hands immediately disappear and the effect ends if the hands fail to grapple their target, if the target escapes the grapple or dies, or if the phantom ceases to be manifested. The effect also ends if the phantom uses this ability against a different target. The phantom can use this ability three times per day.
Burst of Desperation		KEY:Emotional Focus / Desperation ~ Burst of Desperation		SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 2g	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus / Desperation.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, the phantom can affect itself and the spiritualist with the effects of haste. The caster level of this effect is equal to the spiritualist's caster level. The phantom or the spiritualist can dismiss this effect as a free action. The duration of this ability must be used all at once, and any of the effect's remaining rounds per day are lost after this ability is dismissed.
