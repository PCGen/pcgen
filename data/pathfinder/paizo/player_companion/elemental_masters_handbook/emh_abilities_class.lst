Energy Bombs				KEY:Energy Scientist ~ Energy Bombs				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.EnergyScientistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural										SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:Whenever an energy scientist regains his daily uses of bombs, he must attune to one element and its corresponding energy type: air (electricity), earth (acid), fire (fire), or water (cold). The energy scientist's bombs deal the type of energy damage that corresponds to his attuned element until he regains his daily uses of bombs, at which point he must attune to one element again. If the energy scientist uses a discovery that changes his bomb's damage type to one that is different from that of his attuned element (such as using the acid bomb discovery when the alchemist is attuned to fire), instead of its normal amount of damage, the bomb deals %1d4 points of damage. This ability causes the explosive bomb and inferno bomb discoveries to change the bomb's damage type to fire if the alchemist is not attuned to fire. This ability alters bombs.|1+(AlchemistLVL-1)/2

While studying the remains of an elemental that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute per alchemist level, you can attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 20 + the elemental's CR) as a standard action. Success means the alchemist produces a number of canisters of alchemist's fire (from fire and magma elementals), bottled lightning UE (from air and lightning elementals), deadground dust (from earth and mud elementals; see page 31), or liquid ice UE (from water and ice elementals) equal to half the elemental's CR, rounded down.

Elemental Destabilizers			KEY:Discovery ~ Elemental Destabilizers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery														SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:The alchemist is able to concoct reactive chemical compounds that affect elementals like poisons. The alchemist can craft poisons that affect only outsiders with the elemental subtype, bypassing their inherent immunity. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its saving throw, the poison acts as normal, but it may have no effect on the creature depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing fire damage to a fire elemental).

As a standard action, the firebrand shoots a 30-foot cone of fire from the barrel of her gun. The firebrand designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it were directly hit by both the firebrand's firearm and her bomb. Creatures in all other squares in the cone (as well as the target's square, if the gunslinger's attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand's bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage(DC %1). Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand's daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack roll cannot be used this way.
