##NOTE:Unable to implement organization specific benefits for Leadership and Practiced Leadership feats -
# REPLY: Why not?
##OP:Would likely require rewrite of original Leadership feat, addition of Organizational Affiliations similar to Regional Affiliations and Human Ethnicities, AND a matrix to crossreference both feats against said affiliations to output benefits. Also, feats extend to non-neutral organizations, but no such benefits are dilineated for those organizations.
Practiced Leadership					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Leadership																																					PRETEXT:Leadership, membership in the same organization as your cohort.							DESC:By relying on the authority of your shared organization as well as your own leadership skills, your cohort demonstrates improved devotion and tactical acumen.

Additionally, your cohort is treated as though she possessed the same teamwork feats you do for the purpose of determining whether you receive a bonus from your teamwork feats. Your cohort doesn't receive any bonuses from these feats unless she actually possesses the feats.

In addition, each time you make a successful Bluff check to convince someone of a far-fetched or impossible story, you regain 1 grit point. Successfully lying to a friendly or helpful creature, or a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level, doesn't restore grit.
Gun Twirling						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Grit						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dazzling Display,Weapon Focus								PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Gunslinger ~ Grit],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Amateur Gunslinger]							PRETEXT:Amateur Gunslingeruc feat or grit class feature, Dazzling Display, Weapon Focus.

The target of this feint must be within 30 feet of you and be able to see you.

The ammunition gains the bane weapon special ability against the chosen creature only. If the ammunition is used to attack any other target, the attack roll is instead made with a -2 penalty. Crafting a named bullet costs 1 grit point and reduces your maximum grit points by 1 until the named bullet is fired or destroyed.
