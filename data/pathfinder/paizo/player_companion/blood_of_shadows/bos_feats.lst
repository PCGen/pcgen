BONUS:SITUATION|Perception=Hearing or smell based|4	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:While you are using this style, you gain a number of benefits whenever you are blinded or unable to see (including when you wear a blindfold or close your eyes). Under such circumstances, you do not take any penalties on Strength- or Dexterity-based skill checks due to blindness. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on hearing- and smell-based Perception checks and gain the scent special ability with a range of 10 feet; if you already have scent, the range of your scent ability increases by 10 feet instead. Having this feat counts as having 10 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Improved Blind-Fightfeat, as well as any feat that lists Improved Blind-Fight as a prerequisite.
Blinded Competence		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blinded Blade Style,Improved Blind-Fight												PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blinded Blade Style],[PRESKILL:1,Perception=10]												PRETEXT:Blinded Blade Style, Blind-Fight, Improved Blind-Fight, Perception 10 ranks																									SERVESAS:ABILITY=FEAT|Greater Blind-Fight																				DESC:Your lack of sight enables you to strike your foes with uncanny precision.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:While you are using Blinded Blade Style and you are blinded or unable to see, you do not need to succeed at Perception checks to pinpoint the location of creatures within reach of your melee weapon, or your unmodified reach if you are not wielding a melee weapon. This ability functions like blindsense, except creatures you cannot see do not gain total concealment against you. Having this feat counts as having 15 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Greater Blind-Fight feat, as well as any feat that lists Greater Blind-Fight as a prerequisite.

Additionally, if an adjacent target attempts to remove a condition that you inflicted upon it with the dirty trick combat maneuver, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. Special: In addition to the chosen weapon, a character with the weapon training class feature can use Cloak and Dagger Style with any light melee weapon belonging to any fighter weapon group he has selected with weapon training. A character with the swashbuckler weapon training class feature can use Cloak and Dagger Style with light and one-handed piercing weapons.

PRETOTALAB:16																															DESC:You devastate enemies that you catch off-guard.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you hit an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC or that you are flanking, or make an attack using Vital Strike (or its improved or greater versions), you can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check against that opponent as a free action. If you succeed, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or take an additional penalty from the dirty trick selected from the following list: anchored in place and unable to move from that square, confused, exhausted, or staggered. This additional penalty lasts only 1 round, regardless of how long the dirty trick's normal penalty lasts, and can be removed by the target with a standard action. You can only attempt one free dirty trick combat maneuver check per round using this feat.|10+(BAB/2)+INT
Eclipsed Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																		DESC:You alter how your spells affect illumination.

If the eclipsed spell creates an area that shines like a torch or raises the light level by one step, you can choose to have the spell lower the illumination level in the affected area by one step, functioning like darkness. If the eclipsed spell creates an area that shines like daylight or raises the light level by two steps, you can choose to have the spell lower the illumination level in the affected area by two steps and create an area of magical darkness, functioning like deeper darkness. If the eclipsed spell lowers the illumination level in the affected area by one step, you can choose to have the spell cause the affected area to glow with normal light, functioning like light. If the eclipsed spell lowers the illumination level in the affected area by two steps, you can choose to have the spell cause the affected area to shed bright light, functioning like daylight. An eclipsed spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.

SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When you travel between shadows using the shadow jump ability, the minimum increment that you can jump is 5 feet, allowing you to split your shadow jumps into 5-foot increments instead of 10-foot increments. In addition, your shadow jump ability counts as the ability to cast dimension door for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Dimensional Agility feat as well as any feat that lists that feat as a prerequisite, and your shadow jump benefits from such feats as if you were casting dimension door.
Snuffing Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																		DESC:Your magic disrupts sources of light.																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to extinguish magical and nonmagical light sources that the target has.

Spells that do not target creatures can't be snuffing spells. A snuffing spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
