Baleful Shadow Transmutation		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Medium,Shaman,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=6|Druid=7			SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow		DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature														DURATION:Permanent				SAVEINFO:Will disbelief, then Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:You infuse a target's shadow with energies from the Shadow Plane, shaping the shadow into one that appears to belong to a different creature, and tricking the target into believing it actually is that creature. When you cast this spell, choose one Huge or smaller creature of the animal type or one Medium or Small creature of the humanoid type. If the chosen creature is ill suited to the target's current environment, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against baleful shadow transmutation. If the subject fails its Will save, it believes that it is the chosen creature, causing it to lose its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, lose its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gain the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.
Dancing Darkness				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Magus,Oracle,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Witch,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Shadow	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to four spheres, or a shadowy humanoid outline							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]		SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																				SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:You create either up to four spheres of darkness that each reduce the illumination level by one step within a 20-foot-radius, or one dimly lit, vaguely humanoid shape. Each sphere of dancing darkness must stay within a 10-foot-radius area of one another but can otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The darkness can move up to 100 feet per round. The effect winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range. Dancing shadows can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

The illumination level in the affected area no longer changes when nonmagical light enters it. Any magical effect must succeed at a caster level check (DC (CASTERLEVEL+10)) in order to change the light level within the spell's radius. Darkvault has no effect on spells or effects that would make the spell's area darker. The spell must be cast on an area, such as a cave or room.

When exposed to bright light, affected targets are blinded for 1 full round and are dazzled in successive rounds. If you cast this spell in the presence of bright light, any target that fails its save is blinded immediately, and dazzled starting at the beginning of its first turn.
First World Revisions			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Medium,Psychic,Witch=2|Antipaladin,Sorcerer,Wizard=3						SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph						COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Willing wayang touched												DURATION:24 hours [D]				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Wayang%,RACESUBTYPE=Wayang]	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:Allows target wayang to pass as a gnome.

Its skin, hair, and eyes change to match a specific human ethnicity. You can even change the target's facial features or produce light facial hair or stubble. The target loses its darkvision, light blindness, and light sensitivity traits, if it normally has them. The target gains low-light vision; a +3 racial bonus on a single Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or Profession skill of its choice; and both a +4 bonus on Bluff checks and a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass itself off as a half-elf.
Masochistic Shadow			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bloodrager,Magus,Occultist,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4						SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Evil|Shadow		COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]		SAVEINFO:Will negates, then Reflex partial	SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:You animate the target's shadow with semi-living energies drawn from the Shadow Plane. If the target fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Strength damage as a quasi-real shadow manifests in its space and attacks it. This shadow remains attached to the target and moves wherever the target moves. At the start of each subsequent round, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d4 additional points of Strength damage; a successful save reduces the Strength damage to 1 point. If its Strength score is reduced to 0, the target dies. If the target is in bright light, it gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against this spell. If in darkness, it takes a -2 penalty.
Motes of Dusk and Dawn			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Magus,Medium,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Light	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to four motes, all within a 10-ft.-radius area							DURATION:1 minute [D]				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																				SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:When you cast this spell, you create up to four motes that shed light or darkness in a 20-foot-radius, increasing or decreasing the illumination level by up to two categories. You decide whether each individual mote sheds light or darkness when the spell is cast. The motes of dusk and dawn must stay within a 10-foot-radius area of one another but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The motes can move up to 100 feet per round. A mote winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.
Mydriatic Spontaneity			TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist,Psychic=3|Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=4									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Light	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:You overstimulate the target with alternating flashes of light and shadow within its eyes, causing its pupils to rapidly dilate and contract. While under the effects of this spell, the target is racked by splitting headaches and unable to see clearly, becoming nauseated for the spell's duration. Each round, the target's pupils randomly become dilated or contracted for 1 round. During any round that its eyes are dilated, the target is blinded if exposed to bright light or dazzled if exposed to normal light. During any round its eyes are contracted, the target is blinded if exposed to darkness or dazzled if exposed to dim light. In addition, any creature can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from the target, even if the creature lacks cover or concealment.
Mydriatic Spontaneity (Mass)		TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist=5|Psychic=6|Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=7									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Light	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One or more living creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:You overstimulate the targets with alternating flashes of light and shadow within its eyes, causing its pupils to rapidly dilate and contract. While under the effects of this spell, the targets are racked by splitting headaches and unable to see clearly, becoming nauseated for the spell's duration. Each round, the targets' pupils randomly become dilated or contracted for 1 round. During any round that its eyes are dilated, a target is blinded if exposed to bright light or dazzled if exposed to normal light. During any round its eyes are contracted, a target is blinded if exposed to darkness or dazzled if exposed to dim light. In addition, any creature can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from the target, even if the creature lacks cover or concealment.
Penumbral Disguise			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Inquisitor,Mesmerist,Occultist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3						SCHOOL:Conjuration					DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes		SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:You mask your features with shadowy illumination, gaining a +%1 competence bonus on Disguise checks and Stealth checks attempted while in normal light, dim light, or darkness. In addition, creatures that see you while you are in dim light or darkness are unable to discern any but the most general information about your appearance or actions. For example, they can determine your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of your actions (such as, "She was trying to break into the store"), but cannot determine your precise actions, your appearance, or any identifying information about you. In bright light, your normal appearance is revealed.|CASTERLEVEL
Shadow Transmutation			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Medium,Shaman,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=6						SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow		DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:See text														DURATION:See text					SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)	SPELLRES:Yes (see text)																		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:You suffuse one subject's body with energy from the Shadow Plane, altering its form to match a creature from the Shadow Plane. Shadow transmutation can mimic any of the following spells: animal growth, anthropomorphic animal, enlarge person, fins to feet, longarm, polymorph, reduce person, and stone fist. If using shadow transmutation as polymorph, the target does not gain any sensory abilities that its new form has (such as low-light vision or darkvision) and the speed of any movement types gained from the spell cannot exceed the target's base speed or natural speed with those movement types (whichever is higher). A creature under the effects of shadow transmutation deals normal damage and has all the normal abilities and weaknesses of whatever form it assumes using the spell. Any creature that interacts with a target under the effects of the spell can attempt a Will save to recognize the target's true nature. Creatures that succeed at their Will saves to disbelieve the illusion take one-fifth (20%%) of the normal damage from the target's natural attacks or special abilities granted by the target's shadowy form (if any), and the target's special abilities that don't deal damage have only a 20%% chance of working against them.
Shadow Transmutation (Greater)	TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9												SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow		DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:See text														DURATION:See text					SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)	SPELLRES:Yes (see text)																		SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You suffuse one subject's body with energy from the Shadow Plane, altering its form to match a creature from the Shadow Plane. Shadow transmutation can mimic any of the following spells: animal growth, anthropomorphic animal, enlarge person, fins to feet, longarm, greater polymorph, reduce person, and stone fist. If using shadow transmutation as polymorph, the target does not gain any sensory abilities that its new form has (such as low-light vision or darkvision) and the speed of any movement types gained from the spell cannot exceed the target's base speed or natural speed with those movement types (whichever is higher). A creature under the effects of shadow transmutation deals normal damage and has all the normal abilities and weaknesses of whatever form it assumes using the spell. Any creature that interacts with a target under the effects of the spell can attempt a Will save to recognize the target's true nature. Creatures that succeed at their Will saves to disbelieve the illusion take three-fifths (60%%) of the normal damage from the target's natural attacks or special abilities granted by the target's shadowy form (if any), and the target's special abilities that don't deal damage have only a 60%% chance of working against them.
Shadow Trap					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Bloodrager,Cleric,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow							COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You pin the target's shadow to its current location, causing the target to become entangled and preventing it from moving farther than 5 feet from its original position, as if its shadow were anchored to the terrain. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action. A flying creature can only hover in place or fall while entangled in this manner. This spell automatically fails when cast on a creature that doesn't throw a shadow, and it ends if the creature is entirely in an area with no illumination.
Shadowform					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Wizard,Witch=4					SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow		DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]		SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)			SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You replace the target's body with mystic shadow material drawn from the Shadow Plane, rendering the target's physical form only quasi-real. Whenever a foe tries to directly attack the target of the spell (for instance, with a weapon or a targeted spell), that foe must attempt a Will save to disbelieve. If successful, the opponent can attack the target normally and is unaffected by shadowform for 1 round. If the foe fails, the target takes only one-fifth the normal amount of damage from the foe's successful attack or effect, and if the attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong as normal (if applicable) or only 20%% as likely to occur. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell.
Shadowmind					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Inquisitor,Witch=2|Cleric,Druid,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm						COMPS:V,S,M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to (CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:You dim your targets' perceptions of light and shadow, convincing them the space they occupy is dark. Each creature that fails its save perceives the world around it as one light level darker than its true illumination level. The spell does not change the light level outside of the targets' perception, and does not create magical darkness. However, the spell creates an illusion of darkness rather than actual darkness, so low-light and darkvision don't allow a target to see in the conditions created by the spell. Even targets that see normally through magical darkness suffer a loss of vision from this spell.
Shield of Darkness			TYPE:Divine.Psychic		CLASSES:Antipaladin,Cleric,Inquisitor,Shaman,Spiritualist=3									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Shadow	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]																															SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:You shield yourself with darkness, reducing the illumination level in your space to magical darkness and granting you total concealment. Your opponents are automatically aware of which squares you occupy, preventing you from attempting Stealth checks using this concealment unless every square adjacent to you has an illumination level of darkness or lower. Shield of darkness does not hinder your vision, and creatures that can see in magical darkness ignore this effect.
Spotlight					TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Inquisitor,Magus,Occultist,Paladin,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Light	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long		TARGETAREA:One creature														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]		SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial				SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:You create a mobile area of bright light centered on one target while simultaneously suppressing other light sources surrounding it. The light level in the target's space increases to bright light, causing the target to take any penalties that it would normally take in bright light. In addition, all mundane light sources (and magic light sources of 3rd spell level or lower) within 20 feet of the target's space are suppressed, shedding no light as long as they remain within this spell's affected area and reverting the area normally affected by those light sources to their unmodified illumination levels. The effects of spotlight are centered on the target and move as the target does. As a result, the target takes a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks for the spell's duration and cannot benefit from concealment normally provided by darkness, as though illuminated with faerie fire. If the target succeeds at its Reflex save, the spotlight is created in the target's square but does not move with the target, and it hinders the Stealth checks only of creatures within that square.
Touch of Blindness			TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Cleric,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1								SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Shadow	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature or creatures touched											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (see text)	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:A touch from your hand, which is engulfed in darkness, disrupts a creature's vision by coating its eyes in supernatural darkness. Each touch causes the target to become blinded for 1 round unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to %1 times. Any touch attack not used after %1 rounds is lost.|CASTERLEVEL
Umbral Infusion				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Cleric,Occultist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4				SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One mindless undead creature											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You infuse the target mindless undead creature with power drawn from the Shadow Plane, immediately granting it the advanced creature simple template. The undead creature's destructive instincts take hold for the duration of this spell, and any attempts to control or command the undead creature have a 50%% chance of failing; if uncontrolled, the undead creature attacks any living creatures it sees. This spell has no effect on undead creatures that already have the advanced creature template.
Umbral Infusion (Mass)			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=8												SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) mindless undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You infuse the target mindless undead creatures with power drawn from the Shadow Plane, immediately granting them the advanced creature simple template. The undead creatures' destructive instincts take hold for the duration of this spell, and any attempts to control or command the undead creatures have a 50%% chance of failing; if uncontrolled, the undead creatures attack any living creatures they see. This spell has no effect on undead creatures that already have the advanced creature template.
Umbral Strike				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Occultist,Spiritualist=6|Cleric,Druid,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7		SCHOOL:Necromancy		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow		DESCRIPTOR:Darkness		COMPS:V,S,M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial				SPELLRES:Yes																			SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:You create a bolt of dark energy and use it to make a ranged touch attack that ignores concealment (but not total concealment). If you hit, the target takes (min(20,CASTERLEVEL))d6 points of damage. Half of this damage is cold damage and half of it is negative energy. The bolt's shadow expands and covers the target, rendering him blind for the duration of the spell. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the blind condition.
Wall of Split Illumination		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Magus,Occultist,Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness|Light	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-high vertical sheet of illumination up to (CASTERLEVEL*5) ft. long			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]		SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:An immobile curtain of illumination springs into existence. When created, one side of the wall (designated by you) radiates bright light to a range of 60 feet away from that side while the other side radiates darkness to an equal distance. This effect alters the illumination level by up to two steps toward either bright light (the light side) or darkness (the dark side). The wall also obstructs vision through it, regardless of which side of the wall the viewer is on.



First World Revisions.MOD																																																																																																								DESC:The wayang loses her darkvision racial trait and gains the low-light vision racial trait in its place. The alignment and personality of the wayang are not affected by the transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as per undetectable alignment. Unlike ancestral regression, this spell grants the target a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as a gnome; even though the wayang appears as a gnomish analog of herself, the differences between gnomes and wayangs are great enough that she cannot be mistaken for a gnome by other wayangs who know her.
