DESC:There’s more to faith than simply choosing a god. In the Pathfinder campaign setting, dozens of different religions, traditions, and philosophies war for people’s hearts and minds—sometimes with reasoned arguments, and sometimes with bloodied swords. Whether as a servant of a powerful deity, a devotee of a world-shaping philosophy, or a zealous atheist, it’s time to claim the power of your convictions with this guide to devotion—religious or otherwise.
