CATEGORY=Special Ability|Flotsam Subdomain ~ Sift.MOD																															DESC:Once per day you can reach into water as a standard action and pull out an object with a maximum gp value of %1. This object always has the broken condition upon being withdrawn from the water. The water you reach into must be at least deep enough to fully immerse yourself. If retrieving an object which would not normally float, assume it rests on top of, or is entwined with, debris that does float. Objects retrieved in this manner disappear after 24 hours if they haven't yet been used up or otherwise destroyed.|SiftObjectValue|PREPCLEVEL:MAX=12

Call Fire								KEY:Arson Subdomain ~ Call Fire		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower											DESC:As a standard action, you can stretch out your hand toward any visible fire source within 60 feet and beckon it toward you. This causes a ribbon-thin streak of fire to approach you in a straight line through the air. Any creature directly in the fire ribbon's path takes 1d4 points of fire damage; a successful Reflex save (DC %1) negates this damage. When the ribbon of fire reaches your hand, it either extinguishes or lights a flammable object of your choice that you're holding. You can use this ability %2 times per day.|DomainFireDC|DomainFireTimes																					SOURCEPAGE:p.27	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|DomainFireTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day
