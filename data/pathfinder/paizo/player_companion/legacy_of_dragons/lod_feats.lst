DESC:Your open stance invites opponents to attack you, and like a linnorm's death curse, your retributive strikes punish those foolish enough to accept the invitation.					SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:While using this style, you take a –2 penalty to your AC against melee attacks. After a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can choose to add your Wisdom bonus to the damage from your unarmed strikes against that creature, rather than your Strength bonus.

If a creature's melee attack would normally miss you, you can allow it to hit you to gain this bonus; the attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die). Furthermore, if a melee attack deals enough damage to knock you unconscious or kill you, you can make a single retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent as a free action before you drop unconscious or die. If you do so, when you are restored to consciousness or to life, you are stunned for 1 round.

This acts as an attack of opportunity, and counts against the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round. Additionally, once per day when a melee attack deals enough damage to knock you unconscious or kill you, the attacker must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1) or be stunned for 1 round. This save occurs after you make the retaliatory unarmed strike granted by the Linnorm Vengeance feat.|10+TL/2+WIS
