PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_WIS,13						DESC:Your open stance invites opponents to attack you, and like a linnorm's death curse, your retributive strikes punish those foolish enough to accept the invitation.																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:While using this style, you take a -2 penalty to your AC against melee attacks. After a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can choose to add your Wisdom bonus to the damage from your unarmed strikes against that creature, rather than your Strength bonus.

Furthermore, if a melee attack deals enough damage to knock you unconscious or kill you, you can make a single retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent as a free action before you drop unconscious or die. If you do so, when you are restored to consciousness or to life, you are stunned for 1 round.

This save occurs after you make the retaliatory unarmed strike granted by the Linnorm Vengeance feat.|10+TL/2+WIS
