DESC:The Power of Dragons Is Yours! Few creatures inspire greater awe than dragons, and Pathfinder Player Companion: Legacy of Dragons dives into the ripples left in these mighty creatures' wake. Whether they help or harm, dragons make a lasting impression, from the legends and philosophies they inspire to the bloodlines they foster.
