Apsu's Shining Scales		NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Alchemist,Bloodrager,Medium,Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Draconic|Good			COMPS:V,S,M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:You envelop your body with silver radiance that manifests as scales surrounding your body, granting you a +5 armor bonus to your AC and causing your natural attacks and unarmed strikes to bypass damage reduction as if they were good and silver weapons. Whenever you attack with a breath weapon (including effects that are similar to a dragon's breath weapon, such as an elixir of dragon breath or the dragon's breath spell), you can discharge the Apsu's shining scales spell as a swift action in order to infuse your breath with silver light, causing any evil creature caught within the area of the breath to take a -4 penalty on its Reflex save and to lose the benefits of the evasion ability against that breath weapon attack. Evil creatures with improved evasion are instead treated as if they had only evasion when attempting to save against this breath weapon attack.

The target attacks creatures as determined by the following table. If a creature is killed or the target is for some reason unable to effectively attack it, roll on the table again to select a new action for the target. [Roll d%%] 1-25 Target attacks the creature nearest to it.; 26-75 Target attacks its nearest ally.; 76-100 Target always attacks the last creature to attack it. Beginning on its next turn, the target attacks the subject determined by the chart with a melee weapon, natural weapon, or supernatural ability that deals damage. If necessary, it moves to or charges to the subject in order to make this attack. If it is unable to reach its subject on its next turn, the target uses its turn to get as close as possible to the subject of its bloodlust. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls, and cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any abilities that require patience or concentration. This spell is otherwise treated as confusion and rage-any creature immune to confusion or rage is immune to this spell, and any ability or effect that ends confusion or rage (such as calm emotions) can end this spell.
