Banish Possessor			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																		DESC:You are quite skilled at forcing a possessing creature from its host.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:Whenever you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability or supernatural ability that allows a creature that is being possessed by another creature to attempt a new saving throw to end the spell or effect (such as protection from evil), the possessed creature can roll the new saving throw twice and take the better of the two results as the actual result.
Channel Spirit				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Spirit],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spirit Ridden]																			DESC:You can willingly allow spirits to possess you, trading a taste of your life for their knowledge and abilities.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:Select one of the spirit legends available to a medium (see pages 33–37 of Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures for more information about these spirits). You can trade control of your body to a spirit of this type for power. You must perform a seance, taking 1 hour and requiring your concentration. At the end of the seance, you invite a spirit of the chosen type to inhabit your body. You do not require an appropriate location to channel the spirit. You gain the benefits of the spirit’s spirit bonus and seance boon, but no spirit powers. Your spirit bonus is +1, or equal to your spirit bonus from any medium class levels you have (whichever is higher). You don’t select a taboo and the spirit gains no influence over you. You can continue to gain the benefits of the spiritual possession for up to %1 hours. At the end of the duration, the spirit takes over your body, and you become an NPC under the GM’s control for a duration equal to the amount of time the spirit possessed you. You can end the duration prematurely as a free action, but the spirit still takes over your body. If you have the spirit class feature, you can’t use this feat and act as a vessel for a second spirit simultaneously, but you gain spirit powers as normal for your medium level. [Special] You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, you gain a new spirit you can channel.|TL		STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE
Death's Host				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (necromancy)																										DESC:You become harder to kill when possessed by the undead.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:Whenever you are possessed by an undead creature that you do not directly control, you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects. You don’t fall unconscious at negative hit points, and if you or the undead possessing you is forced to attempt a saving throw to resist ending the possession effect, you or your possessor gains a +4 bonus on the saving throw.
Ghostslayer				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat																PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=1		PRETOTALAB:1											DESC:Your blade is keen enough to hew incorporeal creatures.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can imbue a weapon you wield with spiritual energies for 1 round. An imbued weapon damages incorporeal creatures as though it were magical. If the imbued weapon has an enhancement bonus of +2 or greater, it functions as a ghost touch weapon. A weapon imbued in this way can deal precision damage (such as sneak attack damage) to incorporeal creatures.
Hand's Autonomy				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Possessed Hand																											DESC:Your possessed hand can act independently.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You reduce the penalties for fighting with two weapons (including fighting with double weapons or when throwing weapons from each hand) by 2, to a minimum penalty of –1. This benefit stacks with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat. When you are unconscious, paralyzed, asleep, or stunned, your possessed hand can still act on your behalf in a limited fashion. The hand uses your statistics when performing any action in this manner. The hand can’t take attacks of opportunity, but can draw attacks of opportunity from actions it takes. The hand can perform the following actions each turn on your initiative count. &nl; The hand can retrieve or pick up an item or weapon as a standard action. &nl; The hand can attempt any of the following skill checks at a –4 penalty: Disable Device, Escape Artist, Heal, Sleight of Hand, or Use Magic Device. &nl; The hand can knock you prone as a free action, and drag you while you’re prone at a speed of 5 feet as a full-round action. &nl; The hand can perform any other action appropriate for a hand and an arm, such as pouring a held potion into your mouth or awakening you from a sleep spell. &nl; The hand can make a single melee or ranged attack with a light or one-handed weapon as a full-round action.
Hand's Detachment			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hand's Autonomy,Possessed Hand																									DESC:Your possessed hand can painlessly pull free of your body or reattach itself, leaving you with a bloodless but raw-looking stump at the end of one arm while the hand itself performs remote tasks under your command, acting in many ways like a strange familiar.			SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You can remove your possessed hand, allowing the possessing spirit to animate and control its motion. Removing or reattaching your possessed hand is a full-round action. This deals no damage to you, but you can’t use the hand while it is removed. The hand acts as a wizard’s familiar, using your character level as your effective wizard level, except it doesn’t gain the alertness, share spells, deliver touch spells, spell resistance, or scry on familiar abilities. Use the statistics for a crawling hand (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 59) to represent the detached hand, save that the hand isn’t undead, doesn’t have the mark quarry ability, and shares your alignment. If the hand is destroyed, the spirit regenerates your missing hand in 2d4 days. This process can be accelerated by regenerate or similar magic. You cannot use the Possessed Hand feat or any feat with the Possessed Hand feat as a prerequisite until the hand is fully regenerated. If you have the familiar class feature, you can choose for your possessed hand to become your familiar, granting it all familiar abilities as normal. If selected as a familiar, your possessed hand grants you a +3 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.					COMPANIONLIST:Familiar|Familiar (Possessed Hand)
Hand's Knowledge			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Possessed Hand																											DESC:The connection to the memories of the spirit possessing your hand deepens.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:Select one Knowledge skill; this skill becomes a class skill for you. Additionally, select one of the following skills: Disable Device, Escape Artist, Heal, Sleight of Hand, or Use Magic Device. This skill becomes a class skill for you and you can attempt checks with the skill untrained. Once per day as a swift action, you can gain a +%1 bonus to any of the above skill checks.|TL/2			BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hand's Knowledge Choice|1	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Hand's Skill Choice|1
Hand's Sight				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Possessed Hand																											DESC:By manifesting an eerie, spiritual eye of its own, your possessed hand can “see” on your behalf.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:While your possessed hand isn’t carrying anything, you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet and cannot be flanked.
Haunt Scavenger				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE.ItemCreation],[PRESKILL:1,Craft (alchemy)=3]																						DESC:You can use spiritual essence to craft magic items.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:You can harvest the ectoplasmic remains of haunts, incorporeal undead, or the like to craft magic items. Whenever you encounter a recently neutralized haunt, the remains of an incorporeal undead creature, or the remains of a creature that has the ability to possess another creature using a racial spell-like ability or supernatural ability (such as a ghost or a shadow demon), you can attempt to extract material components from those remains that are suitable for crafting magic items. You must have access to an alchemist’s lab (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76) in order to extract components from a haunt or creature, and you must begin extracting these components within 10 minutes of the haunt or creature’s death or destruction. After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be of any use to you. &nl; Harvesting components with this feat can take several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the residue increases with the power of the original haunt or creature). &nl; Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or creature being harvested. If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt to harvest those components again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular source. A single source can yield an amount of components up to a maximum value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted. &nl; Material components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts, provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell’s normal material components. Additionally, they can be used in place of actual gold to fund the construction of a magic item with an enchantment or necromancy aura.
Phantom Ally				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spiritualist ~ Phantom																									DESC:Your phantom’s strength is fueled by your own diverse experiences and abilities.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.4	BENEFIT:The abilities of your phantom are calculated as though you were 4 class levels higher, to a maximum effective spiritualist level equal to your character level.																			BONUS:VAR|PhantomMasterLVL|min(TL-SpiritualistLVL,4)
Possessed Hand				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																		DESC:You’ve made a peaceful and permanent bargain with a ghost, spirit, or outsider. It possesses your hand, guiding and aiding you in exchange for help in return.																SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You attract a ghost, spirit, or outsider with personal motivations to possess your hand. This usually involves some sort of mutually beneficial pact or agreement. Your possessed hand helps you in numerous ways, but its periodic, uncontrolled antics are distracting; you take a permanent –2 penalty on concentration checks once you gain this feat. Any attack you make with a one-handed weapon, light weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack with your possessed hand gains a +1 insight bonus on the attack roll and damage roll. You also gain a +1 insight bonus on Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks. Once per day as a swift action, you can retrieve any stowed object you carry on your person, provided the object weighs no more than 5 pounds.

Rahadoumi Exorcist	NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Iron Will																		PREDEITY:1,N									DESC:You can stagger incorporeal and possessed creatures through sheer force of will.																								DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can recite the Laws of Man with such force and dedication that you stagger those creatures that prey upon the bodies, minds, and souls of mortals. When you use this ability, you must target one creature within 30 feet to which you have line of sight. A successful Will save (DC %1) negates the effects of this feat. An incorporeal undead creature that fails its save against this effect is staggered. If you target a possessed creature, the possessing entity must succeed at a Will save to resist being staggered for 1 round. If it is staggered, the creature it possesses can immediately attempt a new saving throw to end the possession effect (possession effects that don’t allow saving throws to resist them cannot be ended by Rahadoumi Exorcist, but the feat can still stagger a possessed creature). You can use this ability %2 times per day.|10+TL/2+CHA|3+CHA
Respectful Prey				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																		DESC:You have learned to assuage monstrous predators with special offerings.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:%1 times per day, you can prepare a special offering. This takes 5 minutes and at least 5 gp worth of foodstuffs, spices, and other ingredients; a prepared offering lasts 8 hours before spoiling. You can present this offering to a nonhumanoid creature (even one which doesn’t normally consume food) as a standard action. The offering’s ingredients must be worth at least 5 gp × the creature’s CR. This offering improves its attitude toward you by one step unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC %2). This attitude adjustment lasts only 5 minutes unless the creature’s attitude is adjusted further during that time, such as via the Diplomacy skill. A specific creature cannot be affected by an offering made in this way more than once per 24 hours.|3+WIS|10+TL/2+WIS
Soulblade				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat																PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (religion)=1,Perception=1													DESC:You can’t always count on having a source of positive energy to fight haunts, and have mastered an eerie talent for briefly focusing your own life energy into your weapons.														SOURCEPAGE:p.4	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a weapon attack against a haunt. If successful, your attack deals damage equal to your weapon dice plus any enhancement bonus (but not other bonuses, such as those granted by Strength, Weapon Specialization, or class features like sneak attack). You can use any Vital Strike feat in order to enhance this attack. Whenever you come within 10 feet of a haunt’s area, you can attempt to notice it as though casting detect undead (with the standard –4 penalty).
Soulwrecking Strike			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vital Strike																PRETOTALAB:6											DESC:Your strikes are so powerful that they harm both your target and any force possessing it.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.7	BENEFIT:Whenever you use the attack action against a creature that is possessed, both the creature and any creature possessing it are damaged by your attack (the amount of damage includes your weapon’s damage dice, your Strength modifier, weapon special abilities, and so on). The possessing creature can attempt a Will save (DC %1) to halve the damage. Damage reduction applies normally against this attack, but incorporeal creatures take full damage from this attack as if they were corporeal.|10+BAB/2+CHA
Spirit Ally				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																														PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=8	DESC:You have a close connection with a spiritual assistant capable of aiding you in small ways.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You gain the assistance of an invisible shapeless spirit. This acts as a constant unseen servant spell, using your character level as your effective caster level. For every 4 character levels you have, the spirit ally’s effective Strength score increases by 2 (to a maximum of 12 at 20th level). If the spirit ally dissipates or is dispelled, it returns after 24 hours.
Spirit Oni Master			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (planes)=4					PREALIGN:LN,LE,NE								DESC:Through forbidden blood pacts, you have bound a spirit oni (Bestiary 3 p.209) to your service.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.4	BENEFIT:Whenever you wear a specially crafted oni mask (which costs 50 gp), you gain a primary gore attack dealing 1d4 points of damage. If you have poison use, you can apply poison to this gore attack as a move action. [Normal] Applying poison to a weapon is a standard action.
Spirit Ridden				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																		DESC:You can invite lesser spirits to partially share your body in exchange for their training and experience.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You can perform a seance once per day, taking 1 hour and requiring your concentration, calling out to any nearby spirit with the skill you seek. At the end of the hour, you invite the spirit to inhabit your body. The spirit grants you ranks in a skill of your choice equal to your character level, and you treat the skill as a class skill. These effects persist for %1 hours. You cannot have more ranks in a skill than your total number of Hit Dice. While you’re possessed, the spirit influences your personality.|TL
Spiritual Training			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																		DESC:Through dedicated study and training, you can resist the control of possessing spirits.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to identify creatures with the incorporeal subtype, and can attempt Knowledge checks dealing with incorporeal creatures untrained. When affected by a dominate person, magic jar, or possession (OA) spell or a similar ability, your mind and soul remain aware within your body, at war with the invading consciousness. While dominated or possessed, you can attempt a Will save as a swift action to temporarily regain control over your body. On a successful save, you can act normally for 1 round. On a failed save, you cannot attempt to regain control for 1 hour, but the possessing consciousness can’t take a swift action that round.
Studied Expertise			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Investigator ~ Inspirational Expertise																							DESC:Your insight lingers within the minds of your allies.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.6	BENEFIT:You can spend one use of inspiration as a swift action to grant allies within 30 feet that can hear you a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against one type of monster for 1 round, provided you succeeded at a Knowledge check to identify that type of monster’s special powers or vulnerabilities no more than 1 minute earlier.
Subconscious Usurpation			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																											PRECHECKBASE:1,Will=2					DESC:You have trained your subconscious to overpower your conscious mind under dire circumstances.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.6	BENEFIT:You can attempt to force yourself to act normally while your conscious mind is impaired. At the start of any turn that you are under the effects of a compulsion, confusion, or possession effect, you can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = the original effect’s save DC). If your saving throw is successful, you can perform one purely mental action (such as casting a psychic spell) as though you weren’t under the effects of a compulsion, confusion, or possession effect. This mental action must be a free action, a swift action, a move action, or a standard action. All other actions that you take during the turn are subject to the compulsion, confusion, or possession effect.
