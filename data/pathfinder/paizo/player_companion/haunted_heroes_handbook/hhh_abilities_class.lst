Ectoplasm Master		KEY:Alchemist Archetype ~ Ectoplasm Master		CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.AlchemistArchetype																					DESCISPI:YES		SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:Able to distill spectral horrors into alchemical reagents, the eccentric techniques of the ectoplasm master originated among agents of the Whispering Way, though their secrets have since been exposed and spread to the winds by their rivals in the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye. Today, the ectoplasm master is not automatically regarded as an agent of sinister evil as a result.																													PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Alchemist Archetype ~ Ectoplasm Master],[!PREFACT:1,ABILITIES,Alchemist_Archetype_Alchemy=True,Alchemist_Archetype_BrewPotion=True]		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Ectoplasm Master ~ Ectoplasmic Extracts|PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=1		FACT:Alchemist_Archetype_Alchemy|true	FACT:Alchemist_Archetype_BrewPotion|true	FACT:Alchemist_CF_BrewPotion|true	COST:0

Ectoplasmic Extracts		KEY:Ectoplasm Master ~ Ectoplasmic Extracts		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.EctoplasmMasterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Instead of using alchemical reagents in order to create alchemical items (including his bombs, extracts, and mutagens), an ectoplasm master uses reagents such as corpse dust, crystallized ectoplasm, and similar reagents as alchemical catalysts. Just as with standard alchemists, the costs of these materials are insignificant and are comparable to the costs of the valueless material components of most spells. As a result of his eccentric techniques and use of odd alchemical components, an ectoplasm master has an expanded formula list. He adds all sorcerer/wizard spells of 6th level or lower from the necromancy school to his alchemist formula list (but must still learn each of these spells normally). If a spell appears on both the alchemist formula list and the sorcerer/wizard spell list, the ectoplasm master uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. This ability alters extracts.

Ectoplasmic Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Ectoplasmic Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistMutagenMod	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Alchemist Archetype ~ Ectoplasm Master	PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,6				SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:Whenever the ectoplasm master imbibes a mutagen, his living flesh transmutes into ectoplasm, causing him to take on a semiliquid form. He no longer gains a natural armor bonus from his mutagen, but instead becomes immune to critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attacks) while under the mutagen’s effects.
Ectoplasmic Servant		KEY:Discovery ~ Ectoplasmic Servant			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Alchemist Archetype ~ Ectoplasm Master									SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An ectoplasm master who selects this discovery adds all summon monster spells of 6th level or lower to his alchemist formula list as ectoplasmic extracts. Whenever he summons a creature using an ectoplasmic extract, the creature must appear in a square adjacent to his own, and it gains the ectoplasmic creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 82). Creatures summoned using ectoplasmic extracts cannot have templates other than the ectoplasmic creature template.

Siphon Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Siphon Bomb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Alchemist Archetype ~ Ectoplasm Master									SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:The ectoplasm master’s bombs can be modified to neutralize and crystallize the ectoplasmic energy of haunts and incorporeal undead. A siphon bomb deals full damage to incorporeal creatures as if it were a force effect, but deals only nonlethal damage to corporeal creatures. A siphon bomb also damages haunts, provided the siphon bomb explodes within a haunt’s area of effect. This discovery modifies the alchemist’s bombs and doesn’t stack with other discoveries that modify bombs.

You must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and use a vial of holy water as a material component that is consumed as part of using this ability. The target must immediately attempt a new Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect.

Spiritual Invocation		KEY:Rivethun Spirit Channeler ~ Spiritual Invocation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Medium Class Feature.RivethunSpiritChannelerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																	SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:Rather than channel the legend of a single spirit for 24 hours, a rivethun spirit channeler can invite a nearby local spirit into her body for 24 hours. This functions exactly like the spirit dance ability of the spirit dancer medium archetype (Occult Adventures 94), except the rivethun spirit channeler doesn’t need to find an appropriate location to channel her spirits since she invites nearby spirits into her body instead of channeling a legend. - Each day during his seance, a rivethun spirit channeler makes all his spirit power choices as if he were channeling one spirit of each of the six legends. He does not always possess the seance boon, spirit bonus, spirit powers, or spirit surge ability from any of these six spirits. Instead, he can enter a spirit dance as a free action to gain the aforementioned abilities from one of the six spirits he prepared during his seance for the duration of his spirit dance. He can spirit dance for a total of %1 rounds per day; these rounds don’t need to be consecutive. After his spirit dance ends, the rivethun spirit channeler takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute and can’t enter a spirit dance again during that time. He also can’t enter a spirit dance while shaken, frightened, or panicked. He combines all influence incurred during spirit dances into a single pool. At 3 points of influence or higher, he takes a –2 penalty on initiative checks even when he’s not in a spirit dance, and at 5 points of influence or higher, his current spirit takes control as it would for a normal medium (this control is not limited by rounds of spirit dance). A rivethun spirit channeler can accept 1 point of influence to recover 4 rounds of spirit dance, up to his normal daily maximum. A rivethun spirit channeler continues to track daily uses of abilities from each of his spirits even while he is not in a spirit dance. A rivethun spirit channeler with the supreme spirit power ability can use only one once-per-day ability from the supreme spirit power each day; he can’t use any other spirit’s once-per-day supreme spirit power until after his next seance.

The rivethun spirit channeler can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. The rivethun spirit channeler can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Each category of condition has an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The rivethun spirit channeler cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except a shaman or another rivethun spirit channeler. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the rivethun spirit channeler for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the rivethun spirit channeler is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the rivethun spirit channeler is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured. Minor Conditions (DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened. Major Conditions (DC 20): Dazed and staggered. Severe Conditions (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated. Dire Conditions (DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned. The rivethun spirit channeler can use this ability %1 times per day. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the rivethun spirit channeler targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The rivethun spirit channeler cannot use this ability on himself. At 5th level, the rivethun spirit channeler can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.|MediumLVL/2+WIS		BONUS:SITUATION|Diplomacy=Influence Unwholesome Spirits|MediumLVL/2

An uda wendo cannot invite allies to a seance to summon a wendo, and by channeling a wendo, the uda wendo allows the entity to gain 2 points of influence over him.

Phantasmal Assault		KEY:Psychic Discipline Haunted ~ Phantasmal Assault	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																								SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:You learn to harness your psychic force against all forms of haunts and undead creatures. Your mind-affecting spells that deal damage can now be used against haunts and undead normally immune to mind-affecting effects (including mindless undead). These spells are treated as though they dealt positive energy damage. This affects only spells that deal purely psychic-based damage (such as psychic crush, mind thrust, or synapse overload); effects based on physical effects (such as telekinetic projectile or telekinetic storm) don’t benefit from this ability. Additional non-damaging effects from such spells don’t affect the haunt, unless it would be normally affected. When you use a mind-affecting effect that deals damage against a possessed creature, the possessing entity takes a –4 penalty on the saving throw against the mind-affecting attack.

If the spell effect already causes creatures to become shaken, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the shaken condition imposed by the spell.
