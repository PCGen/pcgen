Alluring Spores			TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid,Shaman,Witch=2													SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius spread							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.17				DESC:This spell creates a burst of spores that weaken the mind. Creatures within the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty on saving throws against your enchantment spells or effects for the duration of this spell. This penalty increases to -2 for any creature that is (or could be) sexually attracted to you. [Material Components] a clump of pollen
Ally Across Time			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Medium,Ranger=1|Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:max(1,CASTERLEVEL/2) 5-ft. cubes of temporal possibility	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.30				DESC:You create one or more 5-foot cubes of temporal possibility where your timeline overlaps with those of your parallel existences. As a free action, you can summon a duplicate of yourself (not including any animal companions, familiars, intelligent items, or other creatures) from an alternate timeline in one of the cubes you can see, which lasts until the end of your turn. This duplicate has your statistics (though its hit points equal your caster level), threatens all squares adjacent to it, and has any teamwork feats you have. Although the duplicate appears with all of the equipment you currently carry, it cannot use any of its equipment and all its equipment disappears when the duplicate does. This duplicate cannot voluntarily move from the space in which it's summoned. During its brief existence, a duplicate can use the aid another action once to assist you, but it cannot take any other type of action. Once a duplicate disappears, the cube of temporal possibility it occupied dissipates. You can summon ((CASTERLEVEL+1)/4) duplicates before the spell ends, though you cannot have more than one duplicate in existence at once.
Army Across Time			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Medium,Ranger=3|Inquisitor,Bard=4|Cleric,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=5					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:(5+CASTERLEVEL) 5-ft. cubes of temporal possibility		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.30				DESC:This spell functions as ally across time as noted above with two exceptions. First, you can summon (CASTERLEVEL) duplicates before the spell ends. Second, you can have up to (CASTERLEVEL/3) duplicates in existence at a time.
Cold Iron Fetters			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Ranger=3|Inquisitor,Summoner=4|Cleric,Occultist,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One creature									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:Reflex negates			SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.13				DESC:Cold iron shackles materialize around the target's limbs, reducing each of the target's movement speeds by half. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by two steps (from good to poor, for example, to a minimum of clumsy maneuverability). Additionally, if the target has DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron and magic, it is unable to use supernatural or spell-like means of movement (such as dimension door, teleport, or tree meld) for the duration of the spell. [Material Components] miniature cold iron shackle
Iron Spine				TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3|Cleric=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation											CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One living creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:No					SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.13				DESC:You launch an ingot of iron at the target. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the target's skeleton or exoskeleton turns into jagged shards of cold iron. Whenever the target moves, it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and is sickened for 1 round as metal spines stab into its flesh. This damage is subject to damage reduction, but it overcomes damage reduction as though it were a weapon of cold iron and magic. A creature affected by this spell can choose to remain motionless to avoid taking damage. Creatures with DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron and magic affected by this spell are nauseated instead of sickened. This spell has no effect on a creature that has neither a skeleton nor a hard carapace. [Material Components] cold iron ingot
Mortal Terror			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Mesmerist,Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Warpriest,Witch,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Enchantment					DESCRIPTOR:Fear|Mind-Affecting	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S		RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:Will partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.13				DESC:You imbue the target with an exaggerated sense of its own mortality and a drive for self-preservation. The target is shaken, and the first time each round the target takes damage (including the first round of the spell's duration), it must succeed at another Will save or its fear level increases by one step (from shaken to frightened, and from frightened to panicked). If the target fails a saving throw against this effect while panicked, it is transfixed in terror and is helpless for the remainder of the spell's duration. If the target succeeds at the initial Will save, it is shaken for 1 round but its fear level cannot be further increased by this spell's effects during that round.
Strand of the Tangled Knot	TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor,Shaman,Witch=1											SCHOOL:Abjuration												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]													SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You mimic tugging at the Green Mother's legendary Tangled Knot to subtly alter your fate. The next single attack made against you takes a -10 penalty. If that attack is a critical hit, it is instead treated as a normal hit. [Material Components] a small knot of twine
Temporal Divergence		TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7|Cleric=8[PREDEITY:1,Shyka]						SCHOOL:Transmutation											CASTTIME:1 swift action		COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:Instantaneous															SOURCEPAGE:p.31				DESC:This spell allows you to witness two divergent decisions and choose which to pursue. Upon completing this spell, you must immediately choose two other different spells that you could cast at that moment and that each have a casting time of 1 standard action; these spells take effect simultaneously, and you must track all resulting effects, areas of effect, saving throws, and other outcomes separately as if each had been cast normally and the other spell had never happened. Once you've seen how each spell resolves, you must choose which version of reality occurred, expending the standard action, prepared spell, and material components as necessary. The other spell's results are ignored and do not require an action or expend the prepared spell, spell slot, or material components. If the targets of the spell you did not choose expended any resources or effects to resist your spell, those resources or effects are also not expended. If you cast this spell and do not or cannot immediately follow the instructions described above, this spell has no effect. For example, after casting this spell, a wizard could cast temporal stasis on a demon and fireball on a group of orcs. Seeing that the demon succeeds at its saving throw against temporal stasis and that the fireball kills many orcs, the wizard chooses the fireball to take effect. The temporal stasis is treated as if it had not been cast, and its spell slot and costly material component are not expended. Casting this spell more than once in a single day is risky. On the second and subsequent casting in a 24-hour period, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or be exposed to a crippling array of possibilities and paradoxes that leave you confused for 24 hours. Whenever this confusion would cause you to attack the nearest creature, you instead expend your highest-level remaining prepared spell or spell slot, if any, with no effect. [Material Components] mithral wishbone worth 100 gp
Thirsting Entanglement		TYPE:Divine				CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Shaman=4													SCHOOL:Transmutation											CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,DF	RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:Plants in a 40-ft.-radius spread					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]				SAVEINFO:Reflex partial; see text	SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.17				DESC:This spell functions as entangle, except the plants latch on to targets and drain away their vitality. Any creature that fails a save to avoid becoming entangled or fails a check to break free takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage.
Threefold Face			TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Medium,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3|Cleric=3[PREDEITY:1,Magdh]							SCHOOL:Transmutation											CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:9 minutes															SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:You grow two additional faces set equidistantly around your head, each embodying a different aspect of your personality that you choose (such as kindliness, joy, or wrath). You gain all-around vision and can't be flanked. Effects that would blind you, deafen you, block your mouth, or otherwise affect your face, including beneficial effects that grant you exceptional vision, only affect a single face (for example, it would take three castings of blindness/deafness to blind you). You lose all-around vision if even a single face becomes blind. This spell doesn't grant you additional magic item slots or additional heads. When threefold face ends, you gain all the conditions from all three faces, for good or ill. [Material Components] a three-pointed knot
Threefold Form			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Druid,Psychic,Witch=9													SCHOOL:Divination												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,F		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:9 rounds																SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:You pull forth idealized versions of yourself at various ages from your mind, splitting into three copies of yourself. Threefold form functions as bilocation (Occult Adventures 158), except there are three of you instead of two, and each of the three bodies is under the effect of threefold aspect APG with a different idealized age. Other than the differences from threefold aspect, each body shares all other effects with you, as normal for bilocation. [Spell Focus] a green, three-pointed knot made of mithral worth 729 gp
Threefold Sight			TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Medium,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3|Cleric=3[PREDEITY:1,Magdh]			SCHOOL:Divination												CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,M/DF	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:3 minutes															SOURCEPAGE:p.25				DESC:You view several possible futures at once, allowing you to thread a needle around disasters by taking a middle path. For the duration of this spell, whenever you roll for an attack, saving throw, or skill check, roll three d20 and use the middle of the three rolls (or the highest, if more than one die shows the same highest value, or the lowest, if more than one die shows the same lowest value). If another ability would make you roll an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check twice and take the higher result, roll twice and take the lower result, or reroll, that ability has no effect and threefold sight ends immediately. [Material Components] a three-pointed knot
Temporal Regression		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=8|druid=9|Cleric=8[PREDEITY:1,Shyka]					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation							CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V,S,F		RANGE:Personal and close; see below	TARGETAREA:You and a fixed time/location in space-time			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or until discharged										SOURCEPAGE:p.31				DESC:When you complete this spell, note your current location and condition, including your hit point total and any ongoing conditions affecting you as well as their durations (e.g. poison, sickened, ability damage, and spell effects). This spell creates a beacon in space-time that's imperceptible to anyone but you. As a standard action while you are within range of the beacon before the spell's duration expires, you can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to the marked location and restore yourself to the condition you were in when you cast the spell; this does not restore any expended items, charges, or spells you may have used during that time. This does not reverse effects for anyone else, and to bystanders it appears as though you teleported to the beacon location and regained conditions you had when the beacon was set. Temporal regression strains your body; when the spell is discharged, you gain 1 temporary negative level for every 2 rounds that passed since you cast the spell. These negative levels disappear after 24 hours. You can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to your beacon as an immediate action instead of a standard action, but doing so utterly and entirely consumes the spell's focus. [Spell Focus] hourglass filled with powdered horacalcum worth 1,500 gp
