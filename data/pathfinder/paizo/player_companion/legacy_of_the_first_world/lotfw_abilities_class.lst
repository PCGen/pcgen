Additionally, whenever the First World innovator would use a dose of primal reagents to gain an additional effect for a mutagen, he may roll 1d6 for the effect, adding to the list of options above: the mutagen grants immunity to poison and paralysis; or one numeric benefit of the mutagen (such as the natural armor bonus) selected by the First World innovator increases by 1d3.|PRECLASS:1,Alchemist=10

This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell or with similar abilities, such as the copycat ability of the Trickery domain.	DESC: &nl; At 5th level, an ankou's shadow gains a second shadow double. In addition to using these shadow doubles as mirror images in his square, he can move his doubles as part of his own move action, dividing his movement between himself and his doubles. When outside his square, shadow doubles do not protect the ankou's shadow as mirror image and are limited in the actions they can take. Shadow doubles provide flanking for the ankou's shadow and his allies, but they do not possess teamwork feats or special abilities that alter the effects of flanking or aiding another. As a swift action, the ankou's shadow can direct his shadow doubles to use the aid another action, using his own base attack bonus plus his Intelligence modifier for the roll. Although a shadow double appears to duplicate the ankou's shadow's gear, this gear is part of its form; a shadow double's gear cannot be destroyed, dropped, or stolen. A shadow double disappears if it ventures more than 50 feet from the ankou's shadow or if it leaves his line of sight or effect. A shadow double that is hit by an attack roll or takes any damage is destroyed. The AC of a shadow double is equal to the ankou's shadow's touch AC, and it has the same CMD and saving throw bonuses as the ankou's shadow. Shadow doubles possess evasion if the ankou's shadow does.

The alternate version has half the chronomancer's total hit points (but not any temporary hit points) and those spells the chronomancer had prepared when he died. The alternate version has the same equipment as the chronomancer but does not bear any artifacts the chronomancer was carrying. Any expendable items, charges, or expensive material components the alternate version uses are also expended for the chronomancer. This alternate version remains for 1 minute before the duplicate and its equipment are ripped back to their reality.
