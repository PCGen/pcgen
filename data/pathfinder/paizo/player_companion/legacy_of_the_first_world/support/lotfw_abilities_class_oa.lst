Fortress of Sorrow								KEY:Psychic Discipline Sorrow ~ Fortress of Sorrow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike			SOURCEPAGE:p.22	DESC:You can mentally construct an extraplanar retreat on the Astral Plane. This ability functions as lesser create demiplane (UM) with a caster level equal to your psychic level, with the following adjustments: you need no focus to create the fortress of sorrow; the demiplane is permanent until dismissed by you; you cannot create more than one demiplane with this ability or add to the plane's area by casting the spell again; the light level on the demiplane is dim, though light sources affect it normally; and you cannot bring other creatures to your demiplane. Once per day, you can enter your demiplane (as plane shift), and once per day, you can return in a similar manner, arriving at the same spot you left from (or the nearest available space).
