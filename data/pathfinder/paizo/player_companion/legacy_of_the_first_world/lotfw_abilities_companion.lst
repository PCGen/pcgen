# ==============================

Twinned				KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Twinned				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	PREVARGTEQ:MASTERVAR("EidolonIsTwinned"),1	DESC:Just like a summoner, a twinned eidolon learns to use weapons and magic. While twinned eidolons are ethically more flexible than most eidolons, they are quite adamant about being treated as equals and not as servants. They demonstrate an eerie consistency with the summoner's manner of thinking, providing similar answers to questions and reacting similarly to startling events. This subtype is restricted to twinned summoners.
