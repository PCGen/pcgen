Biological Lattice		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																										PRERACE:1,Gathlain	PREMOVE:1,Fly=1						DESC:You have practiced storing items in and retrieving them from the tangled vines on your back.		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	BENEFIT:As a move action, you can store an item you are carrying in your vines. While you are holding an item in your vines, you lose your fly speed. You can retrieve the stored item as a swift action or drop it as a free action, immediately regaining your fly speed in either case.
Centered Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic																																	PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=3		DESC:You can make a spell explode around you, leaving a safe zone for yourself at the center of the blast.	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You can center the area of a spell with an area effect and duration of instantaneous on you, and exclude yourself from the effects of the spell. Your familiar (if any) is also excluded from the effect, provided that it is in your square and at least one size category smaller than you. A centered spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.
Conduit Casting			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Teamwork																																	PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=3		DESC:Your magic flows through your ally.												SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:Whenever you are within 30 feet of an ally who also has this feat, you can channel your magic through her when casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, provided that she has the spell on her class list or has the ability to cast it as a spell-like ability. The spell cannot have a range of personal. When you finish casting the spell, the ally may spend an immediate action to act as your conduit. Your ally must concentrate to act as the conduit for the spell, just as if she were casting the spell, and the spell is lost if a concentration check is required and she fails (such as from damage, or to cast the spell defensively). If successfully cast, the spell originates from the ally's space instead of yours. You remain the spell's caster for the purpose of determining the caster level, saving throw DC, and so on, but your ally selects the targets or area affected and makes any required attack rolls for the spell.
Eerily Centered			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Gnome ~ Bleachling															PRERACE:1,Gnome										DESC:Little can shake your peaceful temperament.

Effects with the fear descriptor or that grant you a morale bonus affect you for only half the normal duration (minimum 1 round), and such effects that you can activate on yourself (such as a barbarian's rage) require you to expend daily uses or rounds of those abilities at twice the normal rate.

Improved Outflank			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Teamwork	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Outflank																PRETOTALAB:6													DESC:You can easily find openings in your enemies' defenses.								SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are threatening the same foe, you are considered to be flanking that foe if you are adjacent to an unoccupied square from which you would be able to flank the foe with your ally.

Improved Precise Strike		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Teamwork	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Precise Strike							PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13			PRETOTALAB:4													DESC:Your precise timing and smooth teamwork allow you to strike a foe where it hurts.

Introspective Performance	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Performance,TYPE.BardicPerformance																	PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=3	DESC:With no other allies to enjoy your performance, you improvise to make it more inspiring for yourself.	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Whenever you are the only creature affected by a bardic performance or raging song that normally affects all allies within a range, any bonuses granted by your bardic performance or raging song are calculated as though your class level were 4 higher. This feat does not allow you to activate a bardic performance or raging song if your actual class level is not high enough to use that performance.
Selfish Channel			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Channel Energy,TYPE.Channel Positive Energy,TYPE.Channel Negative Energy																	DESC:You can hoard channeled energy for yourself.										SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Whenever you channel positive energy to heal creatures, you regain half again as many hit points (+50%%) as normal if you're the only creature healed by the channeled energy (either because there are no other living creatures within the area or because you exclude them with Selective Channeling or a similar effect). [Special] If you are healed by negative energy, this feat applies when you channel negative energy and you're the only creature healed by the channeled energy.
Spell Synergy			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Teamwork																																	PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=5		DESC:You and an ally can amplify the effects of beneficial spells.							SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat and both of you are affected by the same spell or spell-like ability, you may amplify the spell's effect on yourself. As an immediate action as the spell affects you and your ally, you can increase the effective caster level of the spell by 3. This increase in caster level doesn't affect the spell's duration or the effects for any target of the spell other than yourself. The increase doesn't stack with any other effects that might increase the spell's caster level.

Unfettered Rage			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Rage														PRETOTALAB:6													DESC:When no allies are nearby, you can safely unleash the full extent of your fury.				SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:While raging, when you make a full attack with a melee weapon, you can expend an extra round of rage and make one additional attack at your highest base attack bonus, taking a -2 penalty on all of your attacks and a -2 penalty to your AC until your next turn. You cannot use this ability if there are any allies within 5 feet of you or of any squares you threaten. This benefit does not stack with similar effects, such as haste.
