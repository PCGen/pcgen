Sargava's alliance with the Shackles has led to a proliferation of the art there, and battle dancers are often found among Mwangi-descended pirates.

A battle dancer can treat her Charisma score as her Intelligence score for this purpose. In addition, she can attempt a Perform (dance) check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat, and her unarmed strikes are considered to have the Performance weapon special quality.

Rolling Flurry						KEY:Battle Dancer ~ Rolling Flurry													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Features.BattleDancerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																																																																															DESC:When a battle dancer uses her brawler's flurry, she must move 5 feet before each melee attack or combat maneuver. If she is unable to move 5 feet, she can't attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can't exceed her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks. While using this ability, she can still take her normal 5-foot step before or after making her attacks. This alters brawler's flurry.																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.4
Dancing Dodge						KEY:Battle Dancer ~ Dancing Dodge													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Features.BattleDancerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																						DEFINE:DancingDodgeAC|0	DEFINE:DancingDodgeTimes|0	DESC:When an opponent attempts a melee attack against a battle dancer, the battle dancer can expend one use of an attack of opportunity as an immediate action to move 5 feet, granting the battle dancer a +%1 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The attack is still resolved normally, even if the battle dancer's movement takes her out of the triggering attack's reach. This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one that triggered this ability, though the battle dancer can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking the attacks. A battle dancer can use this ability %2 times per day. She can use this ability only while wearing light armor or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.|DancingDodgeAC|DancingDodgeTimes																																																																																																																												BONUS:VAR|DancingDodgeTimes|(classlevel("Brawler"))/2	BONUS:VAR|DancingDodgeAC|max(0,CHA)																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.4

If either the opponent or the ally moves more than 5 feet before the ally's attack, the flanking bonus is lost. This ability works only if the ally is on the opposite side of an opponent during the battle dancer's attack, not if a flanking bonus is gained in some other way, such as through Gang Up.|SparringPartnerTimes																																																																																																																																																																																						BONUS:VAR|SparringPartnerTimes|((classlevel("Brawler"))+2)/6																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.4

As a standard action, he can expend one non-cantrip prepared magus spell to treat his size as if it were larger for the purposes of determining the size modifier to his CMB and CMD, as well as which creatures he can affect with combat maneuvers.
