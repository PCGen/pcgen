The broken-back seax is the size of a short sword, and has a broad blade with a distinctive trapezoidal shape. If your Strength score is less than 15, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls with a broken-back seax, as you're unable to put enough force into the blows to land them effectively.
Double Spear																	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Spear (Double)									TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Double.Piercing.Spear.Weapon Group Spears.Weapon Group Double						COST:25		WT:12					CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1		ALTCRITMULT:x3	ALTCRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Quality ~ Double		ALTEQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Quality ~ Double	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.30																													DESC:This long, heavy spear has a point at each end, allowing it to be used as a double weapon.

A split-blade sword resembles a large scimitar whose blade splits into two about two-thirds of the way toward the tip. If your Dexterity score is less than 15, you take a –2 penalty on attacks rolls with a split-blade sword, as you're unable to maneuver its unusual blade.
Traveling Kettle																PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Traveling Kettle									TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Simple.Light.Finesseable.Bludgeoning.Weapon Group Monk												COST:5		WT:2					CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1										DAMAGE:1d6					EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Quality ~ Monk							WIELD:Light			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.30																													DESC:These small tea kettles are made with clamping lids and heavily reinforced handles, allowing them to be swung like a club. A traveling kettle with boiling water inside deals an additional 1 point of fire damage on a hit. Boiling water cools to a nondamaging temperature after 5 minutes.

# Training Equipment
Belled Catsuit																	TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable			COST:30		WT:12			SOURCEPAGE:p.30												DESC:This form-fitting garment is strung all around with dozens of small bells. You can practice your sneaking technique by donning a belled catsuit and then attempting to move without letting any of the bells ring. Old thieves sometimes call a belled catsuit a Billy-Jacket. Training with a belled catsuit requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 25 Stealth check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to hide. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Stealth check.
Billy Ten-Bells																	TYPE:Goods.Tools						COST:50		WT:6			SOURCEPAGE:p.30												DESC:Bearing a marked resemblance to an anthropomorphic wind chime, this complicated arrangement of strings, sticks, and bells is hung from a ceiling or branch and has a purse or money-pouch deep inside. The trick is to silently steal a coin from Billy Ten-Bells, as the slightest movement will set the bells ringing. Veteran thieves sometimes decorate Billy with scraps of stolen clothing for good luck. Training with Billy Ten-Bells requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to pick pockets. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Sleight of Hand check.
Halteres																		TYPE:Goods.Tools						COST:8		WT:24			SOURCEPAGE:p.30												DESC:These paired stone or metal weights look like a pair of curved stones with handles. An athlete can take one weight in each hand and swing them back and forth before jumping, using the momentum to gain greater distance when taking off. Training with halteres requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 16 Acrobatics check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to make long jumps. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail an Acrobatics check.
Meels																			TYPE:Goods.Tools						COST:10		WT:30			SOURCEPAGE:p.31												DESC:Also called Vudrani clubs, meels are heavily weighted clubs used to train one's strength. They range in size from only a few pounds to specially crafted lead or stone meels which weigh as much as a human. This set contains three wooden meels of more common dimensions. Athletes practice with meels by taking a club in each hand and swinging them in a rhythmic fashion around the body. Training with a set of meels requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 10 Strength check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and treat your Strength score as 1 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.
Quintain																		TYPE:Goods.Tools						COST:40		WT:30			SOURCEPAGE:p.31												DESC:At its simplest, a quintain is a swiveling pole with a pair of arms, although permanent quintains are more elaborate and often look like armored mannequins. One arm holds a wooden board shaped like a shield. The other arm has a padded flail attached. In a routine originally used to train knights, a user rides past a quintain and tries to hit the board with a weapon, and then get out of the way before the quintain swings around to strike him with its flail in retaliation. Training with a quintain requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 Ride check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks to stay in the saddle, guide with your knees, and control a combat-trained mount. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Ride check.

Handwraps		TYPE:Glove	COST:.1	WT:0		EQMOD:Material ~ Cloth	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:Many unarmed fighters wrap their hands in cloth to minimize injuries to their fists. Some martial artists also weave small coins or metal bars into their handwraps, adding special material effects as well. Handwraps don’t alter the damage a character’s unarmed attacks deal. However, masterwork handwraps can be enchanted as weapons, providing their benefits on unarmed attacks the character makes with her hands. A character can’t benefit from both handwraps and other items that provide enhancement bonuses or weapon special abilities (such as an amulet of mighty fists) on the same attack.

# Magic Items
# Requires functional handwraps
Handwraps.COPY=Infested Bandages		KEY:Infested Bandages		SORTKEY:Infested Bandages			TYPE:Magic.Glove						COST:13,500								SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:Originally invented by a wandering Deskaran priest and serial killer, these pale, worn-looking +1 handwraps have become popular among those interested in gruesome yet versatile weapons. As a swift action, the wielder can summon clouds of vermin to land on her hands, covering her fists in living gauntlets of squirming, chitinous insects. The insects do not harm the wielder and can be dismissed with another swift action. While the wielder’s hands are covered in vermin, she gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks, and her unarmed strikes with her fists deal full damage to swarms, regardless of the swarms’ immunity to weapon damage (if any, although damage reduction applies as normal). In addition, three times per day as an immediate action upon succeeding at an attack with the infested bandages, the wielder can transfer some of the insects from her hands to the target. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round.	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.Unarmed|1|TYPE=Enhancement
Secure Sheath																	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.LeastMinor			COST:500	WT:1			SOURCEPAGE:p.31												DESC:Common across the length and breadth of Golarion, secure sheaths take a hundred different forms, from simple loops to richly engraved scabbards. A secure sheath can be attuned to a new owner by that character wearing it continuously for 24 hours. If anyone other than the owner attempts to draw a weapon from a secure sheath, he finds that the weapon is stuck and must succeed at a DC 20 Strength check to pull it out.
Tetsubo.COPY=Wandering Punishment		KEY:Wandering Punishment	SORTKEY:Wandering Punishment		EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Ability ~ +3 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|12000 	SOURCEPAGE:p.31			DESC:The oni of Chu Ye grant these +3 tetsubos to loyal human servants, who use them to enforce the oni's will throughout the nation in spite of the Steel Dictate limiting their involvement. The wielder of a wandering punishment can, as a standard action, assume the appearance of an oni of her size as though under the effects of alter self. This transformation does not affect her ability scores and lasts as long as the weapon is held in one or both hands. Once per day, the wielder can also grow in stature as per enlarge person, taking on the form of a larger oni in the process. This growth lasts 10 minutes or until the wielder drops the wandering punishment. Once per day while enlarged, the wielder can deliver anawesome blow. As a standard action, the wielder can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver check as part of a standard attack with a wandering punishment. She can't move with her target if this combat maneuver succeeds.		SPROP:1/day as standard action assume appearance of an Oni of wielder's size (as Alter Self); 1/day take on appearance of Oni one size larger (as Enlarge Person) for 10 minutes; 1/day while enlarged as a standard action take free bull rush as part of a standard attack.
