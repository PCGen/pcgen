# One-Handed Weapon Tricks
# Ability Name				Unique Key								Category of Ability				Type															Description																																																																																															Ability																																																																																			Source Page
Grab and Stab			KEY:Weapon Trick ~ Grab and Stab		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weapon Trick.SpecialQuality.One-Handed Weapon Trick	DESC:As a standard action, you can initiate a grapple with your free hand (taking the usual –4 penalty for not having two hands free). If the attempt is successful, you can immediately follow up with an attack using your light or one-handed weapon as a free action. If you do so, you can’t use any other abilities that are triggered by a successful grapple combat maneuver check (such as constrict). The grapple attempt provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless you have an ability or feat that prevents this.																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Switch Hands			KEY:Weapon Trick ~ Switch Hands			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weapon Trick.SpecialQuality.One-Handed Weapon Trick	DESC:As a free action, you can pass a light or one-handed weapon you are wielding to your free hand. If you attempt a feint during the same round, you gain a +2 bonus on your Bluff check. Once you have used this weapon trick against a target, you can’t gain the bonus against the same creature until 24 hours have passed.

# Polearm Tricks
Pole Vault				KEY:Weapon Trick ~ Pole Vault			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weapon Trick.SpecialQuality.Polearm Trick				DESC:You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump, and you count as having a running start if you move at least 5 feet before jumping.																																																															BONUS:SITUATION|Acrobatics=Jump|4																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.13

# Two-Handed Weapon Tricks
One-Handed Lunge		KEY:Weapon Trick ~ One-Handed Lunge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weapon Trick.SpecialQuality.Two-Handed Weapon Trick	DESC:As a standard action, you can release one of your hands holding a two-handed weapon and make a melee attack with the weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for the duration of the attack. If the attack hits, you deal damage as if using a one-handed weapon, adding only your Strength bonus to damage if you are using your primary hand or half your Strength bonus if you are using your off hand, instead of 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. Otherwise, you take no penalty for using the weapon one-handed. The extra reach doesn’t stack with the Lunge feat or other effects that extend your melee reach beyond that granted by your size category.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.13

# Two-Weapon Tricks
Weapon Juggle			KEY:Weapon Trick ~ Weapon Juggle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weapon Trick.SpecialQuality.Two-Weapon Trick			DESC:You can draw a weapon even while wielding two weapons. Doing so takes the same type of action as drawing that weapon normally would. As part of the action to draw the weapon, you must sheathe one of the two weapons you were wielding.																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.13

# Weapon and Shield Tricks
Block and Counter		KEY:Weapon Trick ~ Block and Counter	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weapon Trick.SpecialQuality.Weapon and Shield Trick	DESC:You can ready a standard action to block an attack with your shield, making an attack roll as though you were making a shield bash and using the result as your AC against that attack. If you successfully block the attack, you can attack that opponent with the weapon in your other hand as an immediate action.																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Shield Charge			KEY:Weapon Trick ~ Shield Charge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weapon Trick.SpecialQuality.Weapon and Shield Trick	DESC:When you make a charge attack, you can attack twice—once with your shield and once with the weapon you are wielding in your other hand, applying the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons to each.
