Block Chakras					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Flurry of Blows,Brawler ~ Brawler's Flurry	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psychic Sensitivity],[PRECLASS:1,TYPE.Psychic=1]		DESC:You've learned how to block the lower chakras of your foes.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.28			BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can spend 1 ki point to make a single unarmed strike that attempts to block one of the target's chakras. If you hit the target and deal damage, you can select either the root, sacral, or navel chakra, as long as you can open that chakra yourself. The target suffers a specific effect based on the chosen chakra (see below), though it can reduce these effects with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + the ability modifier you use to calculate your ki pool). Root: The target's DR is reduced by 10 for 1 minute. If the target has multiple forms of DR, you choose which DR is reduced. On a successful save, the target's DR is instead reduced by 5 for 1 round. Sacral: The target can't use any of its speeds except its land speed (or swim speed for an aquatic creature) for 1 round, and it moves at half speed for 1 minute. If it was flying, the target can attempt a Fly check to fall safely. On a successful save, the target instead moves at half speed for 1 round. Navel: The target takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls, and it reduces the DCs of its spells and abilities by 2 for 1 minute. On a successful save, the penalty and reduction is halved and lasts for 1 round. 
Block Upper Chakras				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Block Chakras	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Flurry of Blows,Brawler ~ Brawler's Flurry	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psychic Sensitivity],[PRECLASS:1,TYPE.Psychic=1]	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8	DESC:You can block additional chakras.															SOURCEPAGE:p.28			BENEFIT:When you use Block Chakras, you can also select from the heart, throat, brow, and crown chakras, as long as you can open the chosen chakra yourself, with the following effects. Heart: The target can't recover hit points from any source for 1 minute. This prevents hit point recovery from fast healing and regeneration but doesn't deactivate regeneration altogether, so it does not allow a creature with regeneration to be killed through hit point damage. On a successful save, the target recovers only half as many hit points for 1 round. Throat: The target can't speak or cast spells with a thought component for 1 round, and for 1 minute, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 20%% chance to fail. On a successful save, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 50%% chance to fail for 1 round. Brow: The target is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target loses all special forms of vision (such as low- light vision, see in darkness, and true seeing) for 1 round; this doesn't affect nonvisual senses like blindsight and blindsense. Crown: The target must roll twice and take the lower result on all d20 rolls for 1 round and on its first attack roll or caster level check each round for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target must roll twice and take the lower result on its next d20 roll.
Elemental Ki					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool,Kineticist ~ Burn,Wild Talent ~ Kinetic Fist	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Flurry of Blows,Brawler ~ Brawler's Flurry	PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,4		DESC:You can accept burn to gain the benefits of ki.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.28			BENEFIT:Your burn functions like a ki pool. As long as you have at least 1 point of burn, your unarmed strikes count as magic. You can take 1 point of burn as a swift action to do any two of the following: make an additional attack at your highest bonus during a flurry of blows, increase your speed by 20 feet for 1 round, or gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. You can also accept burn instead of spending ki (or a combination of the two) to activate an ability that costs ki points, with each point of burn you accept counting as 2 ki points. You count as having a ki pool for effects that requires a ki pool.
Enduring Might					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Gather Power		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Gather Might		PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,8											DESC:When you gather your might, it lasts long enough to improve your defenses and attacks of opportunity.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.28			BENEFIT:When you use Gather Might, the ability score bonuses last until the beginning of your next turn.
Gather Might					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Gather Power		PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL,8																						DESC:You can feed your body when you gather power.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.28			BENEFIT:When you gather power, instead of reducing the burn cost of a blast wild talent, you can send elemental energy flowing through your body to gain a +2 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until the end of your turn for each point of burn reduction your gather power would grant (to a maximum of +10 when spending a full round plus a move action to gather power with the supercharge class feature).
