Fleeting Focus						KEY:Extemporaneous Channeler ~ Fleeting Focus											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OccultistClassFeatures.ExtemporaneousChannelerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																											DESC:An extemporaneous channeler's studies of the changing nature of objects give her more mental focus, which she learns to quickly invest in her implements throughout the day, but which she struggles to maintain. When an extemporaneous channeler refreshes her mental focus, she must spend 1 hour preparing her implements for spellcasting but does not immediately invest them with her generic focus, which is equal to %1. At any point during the day, she can shift any amount of her generic focus to any number of her implements by concentrating for 1 round while touching her implements. After every 10 minutes, her invested implements each lose 1 point of mental focus, as if it had been expended on a focus power. If the extemporaneous channeler uses her withdraw focus ability (see below) to remove focus before a full 10-minute increment has elapsed, each implement still loses 1 point of mental focus as if it had been invested for that entire increment. This alters mental focus.|OccultistLVL+(INT*2)																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Transformative Resonance			KEY:Extemporaneous Channeler ~ Transformative Resonance									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OccultistClassFeatures.ExtemporaneousChannelerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																		DEFINE:TransResonanceMaxBonus|0		DESC:An extemporaneous channeler can expend 1 point of generic focus as a swift action to allow her generic focus to resonate in her improvised weapons. For 1 minute, the extemporaneous channeler grants any item she uses as an improvised weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for every 3 points of generic focus she has in her body. She can give it a maximum bonus of +%1. The extemporaneous channeler can imbue the item with any one weapon special ability with an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to her maximum bonus by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount, such as reducing a +2 bonus to a +1 flaming enchantment. She chooses the special ability when she activates this power, but she can spend 1 point of generic focus as a swift action to change it, which also resets the duration of the power. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (either on its own or from her imbuing it) to gain a weapon special ability. This ability stacks with any other effect that grants an enhancement bonus to an improvised weapon to a maximum of +5.|TransResonanceMaxBonus																																															BONUS:VAR|TransResonanceMaxBonus|(OccultistLVL+3)/4																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Withdraw Focus						KEY:Extemporaneous Channeler ~ Withdraw Focus											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:OccultistClassFeatures.ExtemporaneousChannelerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																											DESC:An extemporaneous channeler can, as a standard action, shift any amount of focus from any number of implements back into herself as generic focus. Doing so costs her no loss of focus (other than what's lost due to her Fleeting Focus ability). Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was taken. This alters shift focus.

A spell cast as an improvised spell always has a minimum casting time of 1 round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.|ImprovisedSpellTimes																																																																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|ImprovisedSpellTimes|1	BONUS:VAR|ImprovisedSpellTimes|1|PREVARGTEQ:OccultistLVL,12		BONUS:VAR|ImprovisedSpellTimes|1|PREVARGTEQ:OccultistLVL,17																									SOURCEPAGE:p.8
