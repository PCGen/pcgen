Style Shifting						KEY:Style Shifter ~ Style Shifting													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ShifterClassFeatures.StyleShifterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																						DEFINE:StyleShiftMins|0				DESC:A style shifter gains access to style aspects. A style aspect provides benefits only while the style shifter is in the style feat stance associated with the appropriate aspect (such as Boar Style with Form of the Boar). He can shift into his style aspect for %1 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. A style shifter can shift into a style aspect as a free action as part of entering a style feat's stance. Otherwise, shifting into a style aspect is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the style shifter's turn. He can shift between any aspects he has during the duration without additional cost.|StyleShiftMins																																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|StyleShiftMins|3+ShifterLVL																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.17
