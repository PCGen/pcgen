Default Traits ~ Adaro	CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=AdaroRacial|Amphibious
#
Poison					KEY:Poison ~ Adaro					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AdaroRacial	DESC:Adaros favor a paralytic toxin secreted by the flying nettlefin pufferfish-a sticky venom that doesn't wash away in water. Nettlefin Toxin: Spear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/minute for 4 minutes; effect paralyzed for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Poison Use					KEY:Poison Use ~ Adaro					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AdaroRacial	DESC:Adaros are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Rain Frenzy					KEY:Rain Frenzy ~ Adaro					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.AdaroRacial	DESC:Adaros revere storms, and their lust for blood is amplified exponentially while it is raining. While fighting in the rain or during other stormy weather, adaros act as though affected by the rage spell. An adaro gains this benefit even if it is underwater, but only as long as it remains within a move action away from the water's surface (50 feet for most adaros).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Speak with Sharks				KEY:Speak with Sharks ~ Adaro				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.AdaroRacial	DESC:An adaro can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 100 feet.

#Adherer 8
Default Traits ~ Adherer	CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Adhesive ~ Adherer
Adhesive					KEY:Adhesive ~ Adherer					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A weapon that strikes an adherer becomes stuck fast to the creature's adhesive flesh unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save. A creature adjacent to the adherer can attempt to pry off a stuck weapon with a DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the adherer. The adherer's adhesive flesh gives it a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks. It can attempt to grapple a foe as a free action whenever a creature successfully hits it with a natural attack or an unarmed strike. An adherer does not gain the grappled condition when it grapples a foe, nor does it provoke attacks of opportunity when it attempts to do so. Fire can temporarily burn away an adherer's adhesive coating-whenever an adherer takes at least 10 points of fire damage, it loses its adhesive special quality for 1d4 rounds. Universal solvent, alchemical solvent, or a similar fluid removes an adherer's adhesive quality for 1 hour if it fails a DC 15 Reflex save, or for 1d4 rounds if it makes the save. The adherer's skin loses its adhesive quality 1 hour after the adherer dies. An adherer can release anything stuck to it as a free action. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, it can exhale, filling a 10-foot-radius spread around it with frigid air that deals 2d6 points of cold damage and staggers those in the area with numbing cold. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the staggered effect but not the cold damage.

While a target is fascinated, the allip can approach it without breaking the effect, but an attack by the allip does end the effect.

SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Madness					KEY:Madness ~ Allip					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic effect makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.

Change Shape (Su)	KEY:Change Shape ~ Animal Lord	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.AnimalLordRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:An animal lord has two forms-a humanoid and an animal form.

Spirit Blades				KEY:Spirit Blades ~ Asurendra				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AsurendraRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:As a swift action, an asurendra can call forth up to six longsword-shaped force effects that float near the asurendra until directed. The asurendra can use a standard action to direct one blade to attack a target up to a distance of 50 feet away, or use a full-attack action to cause all six blades to attack up to six different targets up to a distance of 50 feet away, each to a different location if desired. Once an asurendra directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the asurendra's turn until directed otherwise by the asurendra and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the asurendra. As a move action, the asurendra can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the asurendra's base attack bonus modified by its Wisdom modifier (+29 for most asurendras), and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the asurendra's Wisdom modifier (3d6+7 for most asurendras). Physical attacks do no affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the asurendra does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes.

Instead of war, an asurendra can focus on the aftermath of war. Such an asurendra replaces quickened baleful polymorph with quickened slay living and quickened blade barrier with quickened circle of death. Its spirit blades deal negative energy damage, not force damage, and can thus be used to heal allied undead creatures as easily as they can serve as weapons against the living.

CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.AsurendraAdditional.AsurendraSpiritBlades	DESC:Blasphemy is joy to any asura, but truly impious asurendras learn talents that mimic divine miracles. Cults to these asurendras, which almost always seem benevolent on first glance, turn people from the worship of real deities. These asurendras do not possess a spirit blade special attack, but can use miracle as a spell-like ability once per day as long as the miracle granted is in keeping with their blasphemous design.

Create Asura (Su)	KEY:Create Asura ~ Asurendra	SOURCEPAGE:p.	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a full-round action, an asurendra can turn a creature that it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a tripurasura (see page 26) that it then excretes into existence. Such tripurasuras remain loyal to the asurendra that created them as long as they remain tripurasuras. If an asurendra has enough tripurasuras at hand, it can consume them as well and transform them into more powerful asuras using this ability. An asurendra can transform any tripurasuras it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a number of Hit Dice worth of other asuras equal to the number of tripurasuras it has consumed. An asurendra can create as many tripurasuras as it wishes with this ability, but can only create more powerful asuras by combining multiple tripurasuras once per day. An asurendra cannot create another asurendra with this ability. A newly formed asura considers the asurendra to be its master. Not all of a creature's soul is consumed when it is used to create a tripurasura-beings swallowed and used to create asuras in this manner are dead, but can be restored to life as normal.

Projection					KEY:Projection ~ Berbalang				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BerbalangRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:Once per day as a full-round action, a berbalang can enter a trance that separates the creature's spirit from its body. This splits the berbalang's current hit points in half between its body and its spirit. The berbalang's spirit body gains the incorporeal subtype and special ability; otherwise, it retains the same statistics as its physical self with the following changes: AC 19, touch 19, flat-footed 10 (+4 Dex, +4 deflection, +1 dodge), single incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d4 Constitution damage on a hit as its sole attack. This spirit projection can travel no more than 1 mile away from the berbalang's body. Because the creature is only partially in existence when in this state, its body gains displacement as the spell. When separated in this way, the berbalang's body is unconscious and helpless. If the berbalang's body is injured while in this state, the separated projection immediately returns to its body, and the body loses displacement. If the physical body is slain, the spirit body immediately dies as well. If the spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it returns to the body immediately. A berbalang in spirit form can end the effect at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit immediately returns to the body. When a berbalang's spirit form returns to the body, add both the spirit body's hit points and the physical body's hit points back together to determine the creature's current hit point total.

In addition, a critical hit from the bogeyman's claw forces any target that has successfully saved against the creature's fear aura to make another Will save against its effects, even if 24 hours have not yet passed.

Record Audio				KEY:Record Audio ~ Clockwork Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkSpyRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A clockwork spy can record nearby sounds as a swift action, archiving all sound within a 20-foot spread onto a small gemstone worth 50 gp embedded in its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound per Hit Die it possesses. Starting and stopping playback of recorded sound is a swift action. Removing a gemstone or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a DC 25 Disable Device check as a full-round action-failure does not damage the gemstone but does erase any recorded sounds on the gemstone. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and subtypes, but not between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to start recording sound as soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes in range, but it cannot be ordered to start recording when a specific person comes within range. Once a clockwork spy begins recording sound, it cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot record sound onto a gemstone that already contains a recording.

The ooze can maintain this form indefinitely. The trap it can assume the form of must be of a CR equal to or less than that of the deathtrap ooze itself-appropriate traps from pages 420-421 of the Core Rulebook include the swinging axe trap (CR 1), the wall scythe trap (CR 4), and the falling block trap (CR 5). In trap form, the ooze uses its attack bonus, but otherwise functions as the emulated trap and uses that trap's statistics and damage. If a creature searching for traps exceeds the DC to find the ooze's trap form, a successful follow-up DC 19 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check allows the creature that discovered the trap to discern its true nature. If the ooze takes any damage, it reverts to its normal form as a free action.

A creature that takes this damage must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. In addition, those damaged by this infestation are poisoned as well. Any area effect attack that deals 10 or more points of damage to a deathweb destroys its infesting spiders, removing its aura for 3 rounds, after which a new batch of spiders swarms out of the undead's body to replenish the infestation.

If the target succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save, it gains two permanent negative levels. If it fails, its soul is immediately drawn into one of the gems in the demilich's skull. The soul remains trapped within the gem, visible as but a gleam except under true seeing. The soulless body corrupts and decays rapidly, reducing to dust in a single round. As long as the dead creature's soul remains trapped in the gemstone, it cannot be restored to life via any means save direct divine intervention. Gems with souls trapped in them can be retrieved from a destroyed demilich, at which point they can either be crushed to release any souls within to their afterlife or used in the place of the usual material components to restore the soul and body with resurrection or true resurrection. After 24 hours, the demilich can choose to consume any soul trapped in a gem, healing it 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the soul, at which point only miracle or wish can restore the dead creature to life.

#Contract Devil 76-77
Binding Contract				KEY:Binding Contract ~ Contract Devil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ContractDevilRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:All contract devils carry numerous lengthy contracts draped over their horns or within their numerous carrying cases. They can wield these contracts like whips, but deal lethal damage regardless of the armor bonus of their target. A contract devil modifies attack and damage rolls when using a binding contract by its Intelligence modifier, not its Strength modifier (this equates to a +7 bonus for most contract devils). Wounds created by a binding contract resemble horrifically deep paper cuts and cause 1d6 points of bleed damage. A contract devil can use its binding contract to disarm and trip foes as if the contract were a whip.

Infernal Contract				KEY:Infernal Contract ~ Contract Devil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ContractDevilRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:As a full-round action, a contract devil can produce an infernal contract for a single living mortal creature. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, as detailed on the following page. To receive any of these bonuses, however, the mortal must sign its true name to the document of its own free will. Upon doing so, that mortal's soul is sworn to the contract devil, condemning the soul to an eternity of servitude in Hell rather than whatever fate would naturally befall it upon the mortal's death. Breaking a contract with a contract devil is difficult and dangerous (see the next page); as long as the infernal contract remains in effect, the victim cannot be restored to life after death save by a miracle or a wish. If a mortal is restored to life in this way, the contract devil immediately senses the development-it not only knows which soul has been restored to life, but also gains the benefits of a discern location spell targeted on the character or creature that restored the damned soul to life.

Disenchanters may instead target specific visible items, in which case they generally target the most obvious items. Artifacts are immune to this ability.

Inhabiting a body requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. The swarm can abandon the body at any time as a full-round action. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's DR, resistances, and immunities may negate some or all of this damage. When a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it effectively transforms the corpse into a zombie of the appropriate size under the swarm's control. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster. Hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour. A hellwasp-inhabited creature is easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of the insects inside. A swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host. A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.

If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the hodag's opponent is thrown 10 feet through the air in a direction chosen by the hodag and falls prone. The hodag can only toss its opponent in a straight line. If an obstacle prevents the creature's movement, both the creature tossed and the object struck take 1d6 points of damage, and the creature falls prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

Touch of Ages				KEY:Touch of Ages ~ Toshigami				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ToshigamiRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind.

#BOG NIXIES - In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets with song or by assuming the form of an animal or humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes, ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out. A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced creature template who has the following additional powers. A bog nixie's CR is +2 higher than a normal nixie's.

Void Trap					KEY:Void Trap ~ Void Yai				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VoidYaiRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:When a void oni uses any teleportation effect on itself (including its greater teleport and plane shift spelllike abilities, but not its teleport object spell-like ability), it can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the closest Tiny or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature.

Before a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to her body, at which point any damage done to the body immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is destroyed can never again walk the day in living form, but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a safe way to travel in direct sunlight).

A rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as you see fit to make a more interesting rajadhiraja. The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power to manipulate life and death according to this cycle. A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition to their other powers.

As with any effect that restores life to a creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The new form granted by this effect can be any form within one size category of the dead creature's original size-the exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja. Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical ability score adjustments.

Implant					KEY:Implant ~ Spider Eater				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpiderEaterRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A spider eaters grows its eggs inside of a living host. Implanting an egg in a host is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the target must be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes paralytic enzymes that not only keep the victim in state of perpetual paralysis, but also keep it nourished and alive in its comatose but fully aware state. This condition lasts until the egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, at which point the young spider eater consumes most of its host, killing it. An egg can be surgically removed with a DC 25 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success), at which point the host recovers from the paralysis in 1d6 rounds. Any magical effect that removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or heal) also destroys the egg, but mere immunity to paralysis or disease does not offer protection.

When swallowed, a victim is transported to its own lightless pocket dimension-a stone prison just large enough to contain the victim. Creatures do not take damage within this pocket dimension, but there is only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk suffocation. A creature that attempts to carve its way out of this dimension with a weapon must be able to penetrate the surrounding walls' hardness 8. When a creature manages to cut its way out of this dimension, it appears to leap out of the taotieh's mouth to emerge into any square adjacent to the taotieh's space-no actual hole is created in the creature, and new creatures that are swallowed later must cut their own way out. When a taotieh is destroyed, its body bursts open to allow the contents of its extradimensional stomachs to spill out into adjacent spaces. A taotieh can swallow up to four creatures at any one time.

Launch Merope				KEY:Launch Merope ~ Thriae Queen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ThriaeQueenRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A thriae queen can launch a stream of merope from a gland in her lower body in a 60-foot line as a standard action. A thriae queen using this ability can control the purity of the merope she launches, which makes it either harm those it touches or heal them. If a thriae queen chooses to make her merope harmful, all creatures in the area of effect take 20d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 29 for half ). In addition, any creature in the area of effect is also staggered for 1d4 rounds (or 1 round if it succeeds at its Reflex save). If she uses it to heal, the merope heals all living creatures in the area of effect for 10d8 points of damage. A thriae queen can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds.

Merope Coat					KEY:Merope Coat ~ Thriae Queen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ThriaeQueenRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A thriae queen is covered in a thin layer of merope. This coating acts as a magical barrier between spells cast at the thriae queen, as though she were constantly under the effects of spell turning. The coat affects a maximum of eight spell levels-when a spell effect is turned, this coating is depleted by a number of spell levels equal to the level of the spell reflected. The queen regenerates this coating at a rate of one spell level per round. A spell in excess of what the merope coat can currently reflect is not reflected, and reduces the merope coat to a score of 0. Spells that fail to penetrate the queen's spell resistance do not reduce the merope coat's efficiency in this manner.

Instead, when the titan attacks with its weapons, it rolls its attacks normally (either one attack for a standard action, or four as a full-round action) and hits every creature in its reach each time an attack roll exceeds that creature's AC. If any such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the critical is applied to one creature of the hekatonkheires's choosing.

Once per year as a full-round action, a hekatonkheires can, as part of a jump, plane shift to any other plane (as per the spell of the same name). It can only bring itself and its gear when it travels in this manner. When the hekatonkheires reaches its destination plane, it falls from the sky and crashes to the ground, creating a devastating explosion of thunder and fire. Any creature within 300 feet of the point where the hekatonkheires lands (including the titan itself ) takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 20d6 points of sonic damage (Reflex DC 38 for half ).

Swallow Whole				KEY:Swallow Whole ~ Tophet				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TophetRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:Once swallowed by a tophet, an opponent takes no damage, but is trapped inside the creature's hollow interior. The construct's maw locks down, preventing creatures from climbing back out. A creature can attempt to hack or smash its way out as normal, but a tophet's stomach has hit points equal to one-tenth its actual hit points plus its bonus hit points for being a construct (totalling 40 hit points for most tophets). Alternatively, a swallowed creature can attempt to pick the lock on the iron hatch in the tophet's stomach by making a DC 30 Disable Device check. If a creature exits by picking the lock, the tophet closes its hatch and can swallow whole again. These locks can also be picked from the outside, but only after the tophet is slain.

The tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.

Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if it had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi's prayer scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322), which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard action), the vampire also loses its fast healing ability. A jiang-shi may create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.

A jiangshi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such attacks.
Drain Chi		KEY:Drain Chi ~ Jiang-Shi Vampire		SOURCEPAGE:p.278	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.JiangShiVampire	DESC:Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains "chi," or life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Jiang-Shi Vampire	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.JiangShiVampire		BONUS:MISC|CR|2	VISION:Darkvision (60')|Breathing Blindsight (60')	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=NaturalArmor.STACK	BONUS:STAT|STR,WIS|4	BONUS:STAT|INT,CHA|2	BONUS:STAT|DEX|6	DEFINESTAT:NONSTAT|CON	BONUS:SKILL|Acrobatics,Perception,Stealth|8|TYPE=Racial	VFEAT:Alertness|Dodge|Mobility|Skill Focus (Acrobatics)|Spring Attack	DESC:Senses: A jiang-shi vampire gains darkvision 60 feet. It also gains the ability to sense the breathing of living creatures-a jiang-shi has blindsight to a range of 60 feet against creatures that breathe. A creature may hold its breath to prevent a jiang-shi from noticing it in this manner.	DESC:&nl; Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, jiang-shis use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).	DESC:&nl; Defensive Abilities: A jiang-shi gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and slashing, and resistance to cold 20, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A jiang-shi also gains fast healing 5. In addition, all jiang-shis gain the following defensive ability.	DESC:&nl; Weaknesses: Jiang-shis recoil from mirrors or the sound of handbells rung within 10 feet of them. Cooked rice, which to jiang-shis mocks the fundamental fact that they no longer eat food, shames them into recoiling as well. These things don't harm a jiang-shi vampire-they merely keep it at bay for a period of time. A recoiling jiang-shi vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the object of its revulsion, and cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature brandishing the object during that round. Holding a jiang-shi vampire at bay takes a standard action. After being held at bay for 1 round, a jiang-shi vampire can attempt to overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn.	DESC:&nl; Destroying a Jiang-Shi: If reduced to 0 hit points, a jiangshi vampire crumbles to dust but is not destroyed. It reforms in 1 minute with 1 hit point in the same space, or the nearest unoccupied space. Scattering the dust before the jiang-shi reforms destroys it permanently, as does mixing rice into the dust with a dose of holy water. Jiangshi vampires are also susceptible to wooden weapons carved from peach trees, as such weapons represent the unity of all elements and life to these creatures. A wooden weapon carved from a peach tree automatically bypasses a jiang-shi vampire's damage reduction. Additionally, any successful hit from such a weapon that reduces a jiang-shi to 0 hit points immediately destroys the creature. Although they normally retreat from daylight, jiang-shi vampires are not destroyed by sunlight like regular vampires and can move around during the day without harm.	DESC:&nl; Speed: A jiang-shi moves only by hopping. This mode of movement is somewhat less swift than regular movement, and thus a jiang-shi's base speed is reduced by 10 feet from the base creature's speed, to a minimum of 10 feet. This unusual mode of movement allows the jiangshi to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement, and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds (like f ly or swim speeds) are not affected by this reduction.	DESC:&nl; Melee: A jiang-shi gains a bite attack and 2 claw attacks if the base creature didn't have them. Damage for the bite attack depends on the jiang-shi's size, but its claw attacks do damage as a creature two size categories larger. For a Medium jiang-shi, a bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage and a claw attack deals 1d8 points of damage. A jiang-shi's claws are even more dangerous than this, though-see the "brutal claws" special attack below. A jiang-shi's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.	DESC:&nl; Special Attacks: A jiang-shi gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the jiang-shi's Hit Dice + the jiang-shi's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.	DESC:&nl; Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2. As an undead creature, a jiang-shi has no Constitution score.	DESC:&nl; Feats: Jiang-shis gain Alertness, Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus (Acrobatics), and Spring Attack as bonus feats.	DESC:&nl; Skills: Jiang-shis gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Perception, and Stealth checks.

Prehensile Tail				KEY:Prehensile Tail ~ Vanara				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VanaraRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:All vanaras have long, flexible tails that they can use to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but the tails do allow them to retrieve small stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.

#Vodyanoi 282
Suffocating Water				KEY:Suffocating Water ~ Vodyanoi			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VodyanoiRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:Once per day as a standard action, a vodyanoi can cause the water surrounding it up to a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making it difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area other than vodyanois to breathe. A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect-vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move-it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit Dice. The slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the difference between suffocating water and any normal water that may surround it.

Blood-Freezing Howl			KEY:Blood-Freezing Howl ~ Voonith			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VoonithRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:As a standard action, a voonith can unleash a bloodcurdling howl. All creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become dazed for 1 round and then shaken for an additional 1d6 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against a voonith's howl is immune to the same voonith's howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic mindaffecting fear effect.

Diseased					KEY:Diseased ~ Giant Vulture				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GiantVultureRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:Due to their filthy eating habits and constant exposure to decaying flesh, giant vultures are harbingers of disease-much more so than the standard vulture. Any creature bitten by a giant vulture has a 10%% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, a victim can no longer be infected by this particular giant vulture, though attacks by different giant vultures are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses. While vultures aren't immune to all diseases, they do gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against such ailments.

#Wolf-in-sheep's-clothing 285
Corpse Lure					KEY:Corpse Lure ~ Wolf-in-sheep's-clothing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:By setting a corpse atop its stump and riddling the body with small, extruded filaments, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can crudely maneuver the corpse, manipulating it like a puppet. The corpse cannot leave the stump or perform complex actions, but is instead used to lure larger prey within range of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's tentacles. The largest corpse a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can manipulate in this fashion is two size categories smaller than itself (thus Tiny creatures for a Medium wolf-insheep's- clothing). When a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses a corpse like this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond its normal racial bonus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.285
Implant					KEY:Implant ~ Wolf-in-sheep's-clothing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can infest a creature with its eggs in one of two ways. A creature that eats a carcass used by the monster as a corpse lure automatically becomes implanted. Alternatively, up to once per day, a wolf-insheep's- clothing can implant an egg into a helpless or pinned creature as part of a grapple action. The target can resist being implanted with a DC 19 Fortitude save, but if it fails, the seed gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its host's gut. The parasite can be cut free of the host's belly with a DC 25 Heal check, which takes 1 hour and deals 3d6 slashing damage regardless of success or failure. Remove disease (or any similar effect) also kills an implanted egg. Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing Egg: Infestation-ingestion; save Fort 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage until host reaches 0, then 3d6 damage as parasite bursts free; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Yithian 286
Amnesia					KEY:Amnesia ~ Yithian					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YithianRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:Once per day as a standard action, a yithian can attempt to inflict amnesia on a target it is able to communicate telepathically with. A target can resist this attack with a DC 21 Will save. If the target fails its save, it takes a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and all skill checks, and loses all memories save for those the yithian chooses to leave intact. This effect can be cured by heal or greater restoration. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.286
Deadly Pincers				KEY:Deadly Pincers ~ Yithian				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YithianRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A yithian always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its pincer attacks, and deals triple damage on a critical hit. Pincers are primary attacks for yithians.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.286
Mind Swap					KEY:Mind Swap ~ Yithian					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YithianRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:As a full-round action, a yithian can trade minds with another living creature it is able to communicate telepathically with. This functions as magic jar, except the two minds trade bodies. An unwilling target can resist the mind swap with a DC 21 Will save, after which that particular yithian cannot attempt to swap minds with that creature again for 24 hours. The yithian can end the effect of this mind swap at any time and over any distance as a full-round action, instantly returning both minds to the proper bodies-if the yithian wishes, it may attempt to use its amnesia power on the other mind as a free action when it ends the mind swap in this way. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.286

#Yuki-onna 287
Chilling Touch				KEY:Chilling Touch ~ Yuki-onna			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YukionnaRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A yuki-onna's touch causes 4d6 cold damage. Whenever a creature takes cold damage in this manner, it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered by the supernatural cold for 1 round. This duration stacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.287
Fascinating Gaze				KEY:Fascinating Gaze ~ Yuki-onna			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YukionnaRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:Fascinated for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 20 negates.

SOURCEPAGE:p.287
Snow Dependency				KEY:Snow Dependency ~ Yuki-onna			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YukionnaRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A yuki-onna is staggered if she is ever in an area without snow while her snowstorm aura is suppressed or otherwise not functioning.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.287
Snowstorm					KEY:Snowstorm ~ Yuki-onna				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YukionnaRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A yuki-onna is surrounded by whirling blasts of snow, even in areas that wouldn't allow for such weather, that comprise a 200-foot-radius spread. Within this area, the snowfall and wind gusts cause a -4 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attacks. The wind itself blows in a clockwise rotation around the yuki-onna, and functions as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439). A yuki-onna is unaffected by snowstorms or blizzards of any kind. Any effect that causes these winds to drop below severe (such as control weather or control winds) cancels the snowstorm effect entirely.

Any magic effect in this area glows faintly. This glow does not reveal the magic effect's school or strength. A zoog can quell or renew this light as a swift action.

#Zuvembie 289
Corpse Call					KEY:Corpse Call ~ Zuvembie				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ZuvembieRacialAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:Zuvembies cannot speak, but their strange calls and whistles captivate the minds of those who hear them. Once per day, a zuvembie may call out, and all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within a 100-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or move toward the zuvembie using the most direct means possible. If this path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the zuvembie simply stands and offers no resistance to the zuvembie's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the zuvembie continues its call as a standard action each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect, and has no effect on deaf creatures. The save DC is Charisma-based.
