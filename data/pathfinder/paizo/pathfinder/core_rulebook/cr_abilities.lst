#I don't think inspire competence is needed, it's just one bonus to a skill but a competence bonus. (he ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the bard's performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th).)
Inspire Greatness			CATEGORY:Internal																																																																									BONUS:CHECKS|Fortitude|1|TYPE=Competence|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT|2|TYPE=Competence|PREAPPLY:ANYPC					BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|%CHOICE+(CON*2)|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																																																																																														TEMPDESC:Inspire Greatness: A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.
Inspire Heroics			CATEGORY:Internal																																																																									BONUS:CHECKS|ALL|4|TYPE=Morale|PREAPPLY:ANYPC			BONUS:COMBAT|AC|4|TYPE=Morale|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																																																																																																												TEMPDESC:Inspire Heroics: Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.
#Paladin, core rulebook: (didn't spoke of paladin but their aura could be added when affecting another character in range)
Aura of courage			CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																									BONUS:VAR|ActivateTempBonus,AuraOfCourageActivate|1|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																																																																																		TEMPDESC:Aura of courage: Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

Aura of Justice			CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																									BONUS:VAR|ActivateTempBonus,AuraOfJusticeActivate|1|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																																																																																		TEMPDESC:Aura of Justice is probably not possible (depends on the Paladin level): At 11th level, a paladin can expend two uses of her smite evil ability to grant the ability to smite evil to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this smite evil ability by the start of the paladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benefit from this ability.
Aura of Righteousness		CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																									BONUS:VAR|ActivateTempBonus,AuraOfRighteousnessActivate|1|PREAPPLY:ANYPC																																																																																																	TEMPDESC:Aura of Righteousness: Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects.
