The alchemical item takes full effect on the next creature struck by the weapon, but does not splash, spread, affect additional targets, or benefit from any other effects that specifically affect splash weapons. Any extra damage added is not doubled on a critical hit. The alchemical treatment causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off 1 minute after being applied if no blow is struck. Infusing a new alchemical item also removes the effect of any alchemical liquid or powder previously applied with this ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.116
Precise Bombs				KEY:Grenadier ~ Precise Bombs				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.GrenadierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																			DESC:A grenadier gains the precise bombs alchemist discovery as a bonus discovery.

The cone starts at the alchemist and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target of the bomb and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead of 20 feet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.116
Staggering Blast				KEY:Grenadier ~ Staggering Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.GrenadierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																			DESC:A grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier confirms a critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC equals the bomb's Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb's staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional critical hits with bombs add to any duration remaining from previous ones.

Bomb Trap					KEY:Alchemical Trapper ~ Bomb Trap			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.AlchemicalTrapperClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																		DESC:An alchemical trapper can use one of her bombs to make a trap. Setting a bomb trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A bomb trap fills a single 5-foot square and cannot be placed in the same area as any other trap. The alchemical trapper needs the same materials required for making a bomb. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to the DC for the alchemical trapper's bombs. All bomb traps have location triggers and do not reset. The alchemical trapper can use any one discovery that applies to a bomb when making a bomb trap. The bomb trap lasts %1 minutes. If the bomb trap is not disabled or exploded within that time frame, the trap becomes inert. Creating a bomb trap uses one of the alchemical trapper's bombs per day.|10*AlchemistLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.128
