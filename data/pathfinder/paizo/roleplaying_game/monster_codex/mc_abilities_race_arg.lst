Cheek Pouches	KEY:Ratfolk ~ Cheek Pouches		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RacialTraits.RatfolkRacialTrait.SpecialQuality.RatfolkSwarming			PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ratfolk ~ Cheek Pouches],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RatfolkSwarming]		DESC:Some ratfolk have developed stretchy cheek pouches that they can use to hold and carry small loads up to 1 cubic foot in volume and 10 pounds in weight, such as light weapons, potions, scrolls, and similar objects. Such a ratfolk can transfer a held object to his cheek pouches or extract an object from his cheek pouches as a swift action. As a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the ratfolk can instead massage all of the items held in the cheek pouches onto the ground in the square it occupies. As long as the ratfolk has at least one object in its cheek pouches, its speech is difficult to understand, and it has a 20%% spell failure chance when casting spells with verbal components.

Those who survive enough experiments sometimes develop strange metabolic quirks that grant them heightened resilience and, on occasion, fortunate side effects when consuming alchemical or magical draughts. As a result, they gain a +1 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, alchemical weapons, and harmful effects from drinking potions or elixirs. In addition, once per day such a ratfolk can either increase the caster level of a potion he consumes by 1 or double the duration of an alchemical remedy he consumes or applies to himself (to a maximum of 4 hours).

These ratfolk gain low-light vision and have a base speed of 30 feet.
