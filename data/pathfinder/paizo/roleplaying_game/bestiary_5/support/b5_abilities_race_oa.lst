#Brain Mole
Brain Drain				KEY:Brain Mole ~ Brain Drain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BrainMoleRacialTrait																															DESC:When a brain mole maintains a grapple against a creature to which it is attached, it automatically deals an amount of damage equal to its bite damage. Whenever a brain mole successfully deals damage to a creature to which it is attached, it drains some of that creature's mental energy. If the creature is a spellcaster, the spellcaster loses a single spell he has prepared, or a single unused spell slot if he is a spontaneous spellcaster. The creature chooses which spell or spell slot is lost, but can't lose a 0-level spell in this way. If the creature is not a spellcaster or has no prepared spells or unused spell slots of 1st-level or higher, this ability instead deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. Either way, the brain mole gains 1 point each of psychic energy (PE) each time it uses this ability as long as it drains at least one spell or deals at least 1 point of ability damage.

Psychic Magic									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DEFINE:PE_MAX_Count|0																											DESC:A creature with this ability can use the power of its mind to cast certain spells. Each spell cast using psychic magic consumes an amount of psychic energy. The creature has a maximum amount of psychic energy (PE) per day that refreshes after a night's rest. A creature with this ability can cast any of the spells listed in this entry as long as it has enough psychic energy remaining to pay the spell's PE cost. The DC for any of these spells is equal to 10 + the amount of psychic energy used to cast the spell + the creature's Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher). Creatures that gain access to undercast spells (Occult Adventures 144) via this ability can cast an undercast version of the spell by spending 1 PE fewer for each level lower that the spell is cast. A psychic magic spell with a PE cost of 0 can be cast any number of times, and can be cast even if the creature has 0 PE remaining. The psychic magic granted by this ability has the same thought and emotion components as psychic spells. The monster can apply metamagic feats to these spells by spending an amount of additional PE equal to the level increase of the metamagic feat and by increasing the casting time as normal for spontaneously casting a metamagic spell. Because this ability grants psychic spellcasting, it also allows the creature to use occult skill unlocks (Occult Adventures 194).
