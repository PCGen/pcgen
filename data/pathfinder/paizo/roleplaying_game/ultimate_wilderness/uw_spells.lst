The starting attitude of animals you interact with improves by one step, and you gain a +2 morale bonus on Handle Animal checks. Helpful animals provide simple assistance (such as using the aid another action on skill checks they understand) as long as the spell lasts, but they flee from attacks and do not support you in combat. At one point during the spell's duration, you can issue a nonverbal command to helpful animals within 60 feet to forage for you; the animal or animals immediately head out into the wilderness to do just that. After 1 hour, the animals return to the location where you issued the command to make you an offering of edible food sufficient for one meal for you and (CASTERLEVEL) others.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The hippocampi avoid combat if possible but defend themselves if attacked. If any hippocampus attacks, the remaining duration of the spell changes from (CASTERLEVEL) hours to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds (so if a full 4 hours remained, the hippocampi last for only 4 more rounds).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

If an attack roll triggered this spell's casting, the target takes the damage instead of you, even if the attack roll would not normally hit the target's Armor Class. If an area of effect that allows you to attempt a Reflex save triggered this spell's casting, the target instead grants you cover against the effect (+2 bonus on Reflex saves) if it is your size or smaller, or improved cover (+4 bonus on Reflex saves and improved evasion against the effect) if it is larger than you. The target automatically fails its Reflex save against the effect but can still benefit from improved evasion and similar mitigating effects. After taking damage, the target is shaken for 1 minute. If the target was already shaken, it becomes frightened instead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Cave Fangs					TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid,Shaman,Witch=5															SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Creation		DESCRIPTOR:Earth						COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) 5-ft. squares [S]; the area must be a stone surface									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days or until triggered [D]								SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text					SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.228		DESC:You create a magical trap in the area that causes deadly stalactites or stalagmites to lurch out of the floor or ceiling of a stone surface to “bite” an intruder. The magical trap is triggered whenever a Small or larger creature (other than you or your animal companion, familiar, or spirit animal) moves through the affected area. The effect of cave fangs depends on whether you create stalactites or stalagmites (see below). You can place these trapped squares anywhere within the spell's range; they need not be adjacent to each other, and you can create any mix of stalactites and stalagmites you wish. Cave fangs can be detected and disarmed as per a magical trap with successful DC 30 Perception and Disable Device checks. All trapped squares created by a single casting are linked, and they are all disabled if one of them is. If you place the traps in an area that is occupied by a creature, the spell effect is triggered at the completion of the casting. [Stalactites] Shards of rock drop from the ceiling, dealing 3d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex half) and creating an area of dense rubble that costs 2 squares of movement to enter. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks and adds 2 to the DCs of Stealth checks. A creature that fails its Reflex save is pinned to the ground under stalactites and rubble, gaining the entangled condition until it can free itself with a successful DC 15 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. One Small or larger creature can automatically clear the rubble by working for 1 minute. [Stalagmites] Piercing spires of rock erupt up from the ground, dealing 3d8 points of piercing damage and knocking the creature prone (a creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone). Once the stalagmites appear, they function thereafter as spike stones for 1 minute per caster level and then crumble to dust. If cave fangs is cast inside of a cave or cavern, each effect of the spell deals 4d8 points of damage instead of 3d8, and creatures that trigger the cave fangs take a –2 penalty on their saving throws against the spell's effect. [Material Component; a sharp gemstone fragment worth 150 gp]|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Both you and the other target arrive in a square you choose in the other's former space. If the targets are different sizes, they must appear in locations that cover previously occupied squares. As with dimension door, after casting this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn, and the other target is staggered until the end of its next turn due to the transposition.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earth Tremor				TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Magus,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3									SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Earth						COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Up to 30 ft.; see text		TARGETAREA:30-ft. line, 20-ft. cone-shaped spread, or 10-ft.-radius spread; see text							DURATION:Instantaneous													SAVEINFO:Throw Reflex half; see text				SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.228		DESC:You strike the ground and unleash a tremor of seismic force, hurling up earth, rock, and sand. You choose whether the earth tremor affects a 30-foot line, a 20-foot cone-shaped spread, or a 10-foot-radius spread centered on you. The space you occupy is not affected by earth tremor. The area you choose becomes dense rubble that costs 2 squares of movement to enter. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks and adds 2 to the DC of Stealth checks. Creatures on the ground in the area take (min(10,CASTERLEVEL))d4 points of bludgeoning damage or half damage on a successful save. Medium or smaller creatures that fail their saves are knocked prone. This spell can be cast only on a surface of earth, sand, or stone. It has no effect if you are in a wooden or metal structure or if you are not touching the ground.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Echo						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Medium,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Ranger,Spiritualist,Witch=1						SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Figment											COMPS:S,F		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close or Long; see text		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) 10-ft. cubes [S]															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]											SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)			SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.229		DESC:You cause a sound heard in the target area up to 1 round ago and lasting up to 1 round in duration to repeat at a regular interval. The original sound need not have come from the area, but it echoes from the target area at its original full volume. Any special effects of the sound are not duplicated by this spell. If the area is naturally prone to echoes, such as a space surrounded on at least two sides by cliffs or high river banks, the spell's range is long. Otherwise, the spell's range is close. You can concentrate as a standard action to alter the echo. You can change it to be any sound audible in the area within the last 1 round, move the apparent source of the sound within the area, or attempt a Bluff check to create a distraction to hide with a +(CASTERLEVEL) bonus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Explosion of Rot				TYPE:Divine				CLASSES:Druid=4																	SCHOOL:Necromancy																COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius burst																DURATION:Instantaneous													SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.229		DESC:You call forth a burst of decay that ravages all creatures in the area. Even nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead crumble or wither in this malignant eruption of rotting energy. Creatures in the area of effect take (min(15,CASTERLEVEL))d6 points of damage and are staggered for 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and negates the staggered effect. Plant creatures are particularly susceptible to this rotting effect; a plant creature caught in the burst takes a –2 penalty on the saving throw and takes 1 extra point of damage per die.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fey Form I					TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Bloodrager,Druid,Shaman=3|Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Transmutation		SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph										COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]																										SOURCEPAGE:p.229		DESC:You assume the form of a Small or Medium creature of the fey type. Your base speed changes to match the new form's base speed, with a maximum speed of 60 feet (even if the chosen fey form has a base speed in excess of that speed). If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain those abilities: climb speed 30 feet, fly speed 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim speed 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, and boot stomp. If the form you assume has the aquatic subtype, you can breathe air and water. If the creature has any weaknesses, you gain those weaknesses. If a listed ability depends on an item (as is the case with boot stomp), this spell transforms the nearest counterpart among your worn gear into that item. You can more easily cast spells that the creature has as spell-like abilities, although you must still cast them as normal for your class. When you cast a spell that the creature has as a spell-like ability, it requires no verbal or somatic components and can't be countered. [Small Fey] If you assume this form, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and Constitution scores. [Medium Fey] If you assume this form, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and Constitution scores.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Your base speed can't increase above 90 feet this way. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain those abilities: burrow speed 30 feet, climb speed 90 feet, fly speed 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim speed 60 feet, all-around vision, blindsense 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, see in darkness, abduct, animated hair, bleed, blood rage, boot stomp, burn, compression, constrict, crushing leap, DR 2/cold iron, grab, heavy weapons, icewalking, kneecapper, nasal spray, no shadow, oversized weapons, poison, putrid vomit, rock throwing (50 feet, 1d6 damage), sound mimicry, trackless step, trample, tree meld, undersized weapons, and woodland stride.

This spell forms a circular portal between 5 and 20 feet in diameter (your choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into being (typically vertical and facing you). The portal is full of gray fog that blocks line of sight. Anyone or anything that moves through the portal to enter the First World is shunted instantly to a random point on that plane (the same point for everything traveling via a particular casting). At the end of the spell's duration, the caster can attempt a DC 30 Spellcraft check. On a success, the portal remains open for 1d4+1 days. Creatures exiting the First World through a fey gate always arrive at the location the spell was cast. While the spell always deposits travelers on solid ground in the First World, it conveys no protections against whatever creatures or environmental hazards may be present there.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

These flames deal (min(5,CASTERLEVEL/3))d6 points of fire damage to each creature that enters a burning area or begins its turn in the area; these creatures also catch on fire. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save negates the damage and avoids catching on fire. The area and all adjacent 5-foot squares are smoky, providing concealment within. You can concentrate as a standard action to ignite one 5-foot square adjacent to a currently burning square. Heavy precipitation (including sleet storm) ends the spell. Strong and severe winds spread each square of flashfire downwind by one square each round, but windstorm-force or stronger winds extinguish the fires.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You must be able to target the creature by tangible qualities such as its build, clothing texture, size, or tracks, but you need not have line of effect to your target. The fungus or plants near the target serve as a scrying sensor for this spell. Your senses of hearing, smell, and touch extend to all fungus and plants within 10 feet of the target, allowing you to gauge the size and shape of nearby objects and potentially to overhear conversations in which the target is currently participating. Your scent ability and tremorsense extend through this scrying sensor if you have them, but any other special senses you might have do not. For 1 day after casting this spell, you gain a +5 insight bonus on Survival checks to track creatures you sensed via the spell. You can dismiss this bonus on Survival checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Greenery, leaves, and vines—even lichen, moss, and slime—offer no concealment to the recipient's sight, though her vision still can be blocked by solid wood, such as trees or wooden structures. Undergrowth does not grant concealment to a creature against a target of the effects of greensight.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hidden Spring				TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Shaman,Witch=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Water						COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:A spring of fresh water																DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours												SAVEINFO:None								SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.231		DESC:You spend 1 hour in quiet meditation, holding the focus component in both hands and walking around a natural area.

You cannot cast this spell within 1 mile of an existing hidden spring.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The stake is treated as a magic and cold iron weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, and deals (min(10,CASTERLEVEL/2))d6 points of piercing damage. Additionally, if a creature with DR/cold iron takes damage from this spell, it is sickened for 1 round and must attempt a Fortitude save. If it fails, for (CASTERLEVEL) rounds, it must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any normally required concentration checks) to use any spells or spell-like abilities it has—the DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell's level. If the creature fails this concentration check, its spell is wasted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

For the duration of this spell, you and the target can separate or merge at will as a move action. While merged, your familiar or spirit animal can't be targeted or affected by most attacks and effects, though it still suffers from ongoing effects and their durations continue.

The image is purely visual, and structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance. Anyone interacting with the illusion can attempt to disbelieve it, and a creature trained in Survival can make a special attempt to disbelieve the illusion. The creature must be within 120 feet of the illusion's area and can attempt a Survival check instead of a Will saving throw. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell's save DC, the creature realizes the mirage is an illusion as if it disbelieved the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You can attempt Survival checks to follow tracks as part of concentrating on the spell, but only events connected to the tracks used as the focus of the spell are revealed by the spell.

Ropeweave					TYPE:Divine.Psychic		CLASSES:Occultist,Ranger=2															SCHOOL:Transmutation															COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 minute			RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One rope																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]											SAVEINFO:None								SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.233		DESC:You cause the target rope to grow in length and weave itself into one of several forms, each of which can support up to (min(3000,(CASTERLEVEL*200)+1000)) pounds. Only one type of construction can be created with each casting of the spell, and the creation remains stationary unless destroyed. Each 5-foot section of the object created by this spell has a break DC of 23, AC 11, and (min(10,CASTERLEVEL)) hit points, but all sections of the creation are magically supported and need not be anchored to a solid surface or any other portion of the effect. Destroying one part of it does not cause the remainder of the structure to collapse, though each 5-foot section destroyed reduces the maximum weight the creation can support by 200 pounds. During any round in which the rope is overloaded, every remaining section takes 1d4 points of damage. You can use ropeweave to create any of the following structures. [Rope Bridge] The rope forms a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to (min(100,CASTERLEVEL*10)) feet horizontally. Creatures can cross the bridge at half speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check or at full speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. The DC assumes a creature is using both hands to assist in navigating the rope bridge; the DC increases by 5 if a creature uses only one hand to steady itself and by 10 if the creature does not use its hands. A failed Acrobatics check results in failure to progress across the rope bridge; creatures that fail by 5 or more fall. [Rope Hammock] The rope knits itself into a stationary hammock suspended in midair. The hammock can be suspended at a height of (min(30,((CASTERLEVEL*5)+5))) feet, with a rope ladder (see below) leading up to a platform of (CASTERLEVEL) five-foot squares, and at least one such square must be adjacent to the square containing the vertical rope ladder. As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent. This does not apply if the creatures in the hammock attack or move more than half speed. The hammock provides a +2 cover bonus to AC against attacks from beneath it. [Rope Ladder] The rope knots itself and hangs suspended in midair, perpendicular to the ground, stretching up to (min(100,CASTERLEVEL*10)) feet vertically. Climbing the rope ladder requires a successful DC 5 Climb check, or DC 0 if there is a wall adjacent to it you can brace it against. [Trip Line] The rope stretches into a tangled mass that fills (min(10,CASTERLEVEL)) five-foot squares, all of which must be contiguous (including diagonally). Any creature entering a square with this trip line must succeed at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 if moving at half speed, DC = 15 if moving at full speed, and DC = 20 if running or charging). On a failed check, the creature's movement stops when it enters the square; a creature that fails by 5 or more falls prone. A creature larger than Medium gains a +2 bonus on its Acrobatics check for every size category larger than Medium it is.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

TARGETAREA:2-mile-radius emanation																DURATION:Permanent													SAVEINFO:None								SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.234		DESC:You cause all areas of water to which you have line of effect to recede as if you had cast control water. Exposed water that enters the area ebbs away, evaporating or leaching into the ground at a rate of 1 foot of depth per hour. Living creatures in the area when the spell is cast are parched with thirst and take a –4 penalty on Constitution checks to resist the effects of a hot climate, and their daily water requirement to avoid thirst doubles (Core Rulebook p444). Plant creatures and inanimate plants take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per hour after the first 24 hours, which bypasses hardness and damage reduction. Living creatures with the aquatic or water subtype, unless completely immersed in water, must attempt a DC 20 Constitution check each hour no matter how much water they drink. A creature that fails takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and becomes fatigued until it recovers from the nonlethal damage. After 1 week, the soil in the area of sea of dust begins to break down and blow away. Moderate winds have a 50%% chance each hour to cause sandstorms (Core Rulebook p431). This chance increases to 75%% in strong winds and 100%% in severe or stronger winds. Short-duration wind effects such as gust of wind create sandstorms with the same area and duration as the spell, plus an identical duration after the spell ends. After 1 month, the soil in an area affected by sea of dust has virtually disintegrated. The area is treated as a shallow bog for the purposes of movement (Core Rulebook p427), with a 25%% chance each hour to encounter an area equivalent to a deep bog 2d6×10 feet across, and a 5%% chance to encounter a collapsing dust drift equivalent to quicksand (Core Rulebook p427) 1d6×5 feet across. The affected region remains desertlike in condition until the magic is dispelled, at which point the region recovers and returns to its original terrain over the course of time (this may take only days or weeks, or it could take months or even years, subject to GM discretion). This spell has no effect if cast on an entirely aquatic region. If the spell is cast on an island, the effects of the spell extend to the shore but not beyond.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The tree has (CASTERLEVEL*4) feet of thickness, and it can grow to any height you designate, up to (CASTERLEVEL*5) feet high. If there is a ceiling or other barrier overhead, the maximum height of the tree cannot exceed the space available. At any point along the tree's height, you can create a sturdy wooden building that fills (CASTERLEVEL/4) ten-foot cube(s). All portions of the structure must be adjacent to the trunk of the tree (or can have the tree trunk extend up through their spaces), but otherwise these cubes need not be contiguous. If you place the cubes so that they are contiguous, the buildings merge together, complete with ladders connecting different vertical levels. The fort is magically supported, but if the tree it is attached to is destroyed, the structure is destroyed as well (the tree has hardness 5 and (CASTERLEVEL*20) hp). Each building you create has shuttered arrow slits on its walls and in the floor, granting those within the structure improved cover against attacks from outside while the arrow slits are open and total cover when they are closed. Each cube within the fort is equivalent to a secure shelter, other than the size and its wooded construction material (hardness 5). When you cast sturdy tree fort, you can designate (CASTERLEVEL) creatures. Designated creatures gain a +10 bonus on Climb checks and are not denied their Dexterity bonuses while climbing on the fort's structure, as they find handholds and stable footholds easily on the tree and its buildings. You cannot cast this spell in an area of worked stone, though you can cast it in natural surroundings that would not normally support the growth of a large tree, such as a cavern, desert, or glacier. If you cast this spell in a forest, jungle, or similar heavily treed terrain, the fort is camouflaged as long as its doors and windows remain closed (or even if they are open, as long as those within remain quiet and take no violent actions), requiring a successful DC 25 Perception check or Survival check to notice its presence.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You must succeed at a melee touch attack to infect the target. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and the spell ends. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can’t recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target’s skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target’s skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment. &nl;If the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending green caress. The target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn’t occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals. &nl;Break enchantment, dispel magic, and remove curse can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious. If a caster level check attempt to remove green caress fails by 5 or more, the creature who attempted to remove the effect must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as if it had just been targeted with the spell. If the spell’s target attempts to remove the effect from itself and fails, it causes the spell to behave as if affected by plant growth (as described below). &nl;Polymorph any object ends the spell and totally restores the target without any risk to the caster, even after the target has been finally transformed, as do limited wish, miracle, and wish (treat polymorph any object as if it had an instantaneous duration if it is used in this way). If the target is in the area of a plant growth spell as it is cast, it must attempt a Fortitude save at green caress’s DC or immediately take another 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score; this stacks with multiple castings of plant growth. If the target is in the area of diminish plants as it is cast, it ignores the next ability damage from green caress to one of its three physical ability scores (chosen randomly); this doesn’t stack with multiple castings of diminish plants.

As a standard action, you can send out a piece of your body to attack up to four Medium or smaller creatures (or one larger creature) within 10 feet of you. The creatures take 4d6 points of damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage and 1d3 points of Strength damage; the ability damage is a poison effect. Abilities that protect against swarm attacks apply to this damage and spell resistance applies. Additionally, since your body is partially a swarm, you take only half damage from piercing and slashing attacks, unless those attacks would deal full damage or greater to a swarm (for instance, an area piercing attack would deal full damage to you). You can still be targeted by single-target spells but you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against them. Casting spells in this form is difficult and any spells with somatic components require a concentration check as if casting defensively; if you are also casting the spell defensively, roll a single concentration check at a –5 penalty.

Seed Spies			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Druid,Occultist,Ranger=2|Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3			PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Gathlain]	SCHOOL:Divination											COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to (CASTERLEVEL/4) seed spies									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]			SAVEINFO:None		SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:You summon one or more wafting seeds, which have a measure of intelligence and make for excellent spies. When they are in your presence, the seeds obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different seeds, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. A seed in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. The seeds can hear but not see. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can't repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, a seed is unable to relay someone's emotional state or determine who among several people it heard might be in charge. Each seeds' size is Fine. Each seed has 1 hit point, AC 20, and a fly speed of 10 feet (good maneuverability). They can't crawl or climb, although they can cling to rough, soft, or sticky creatures or surfaces. The seeds use your saving throw bonuses, have a Perception skill bonus of %1, and can't make attacks. They can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a Stealth skill bonus of %2. The seeds can even cling onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these seeds currently clinging to it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being clung to, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of +0 for Huge or larger creatures). You also maintain a faint mystical connection with these seeds, which allows you to sense where they are. As a full-round action, you can concentrate on the spell in order to learn the direction and relative distance of each of the seeds.|(CASTERLEVEL/2)+5|(CASTERLEVEL/2)+18
Waft				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Magus,Occultist,Shaman,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Wizard=5	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Gathlain]	SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to (CASTERLEVEL/2) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours					SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:You make the targets light enough to be carried by wind. Creatures affected by this spell suffer cumulative penalties for attacking as if under the effects of levitate unless they have a fly speed. Treat each target as two size categories lighter for the purposes of being checked or blown away by wind. If a target has a fly speed, it can fly overland at the wind's speed in the same direction as the wind by succeeding at a DC 20 Fly check. If a creature flying overland this way attempts to change direction, it risks being blown away as usual. By linking hands or creating a connection with rope, creatures affected by this spell can be towed through the air by a flying creature as if each weighed only one-eighth its actual weight.
Wing Bounty			TYPE:Divine				CLASSES:Druid,Shaman=2										PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Gathlain]	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 ft.		TARGETAREA:2d4+(CASTERLEVEL*2) berries										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days					SAVEINFO:None		SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:Your wings sprout a variety of colorful and flavorful berries. Each berry functions as if affected by goodberry. You can choose for one affected berry to also be poisonous (as striped toadstool); only you and druids of 5th level or higher can tell which is which without magic.
Wing Thorns			TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Bloodrager,Druid,Shaman,Witch=3|Magus=4		PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Gathlain]	SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Poison			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds												SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:Your wings sprout poisonous thorns each the size of a dagger. You can use these thorns like armor spikes. In addition, you can make two wing attacks as primary natural weapons. If you are Small, the wings deal 1d3 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage plus your Strength modifier (unless you also attack with a weapon, in which case they are treated as a secondary natural weapon). A creature damaged by your wing thorns experiences intense itching, gaining the sickened condition while the spell lasts unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw.
Wooden Wing Shield	TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Bloodrager,Druid,Shaman,Summoner=4|Magus=5					PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Gathlain]	SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:S		CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or until you move									SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:Your wings transmute into a wooden barrier resembling a tower shield to block attacks, granting you a +4 shield bonus to AC. If you move, the spell ends immediately.

#Ghoran
Delectable Flesh		TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6|Druid,Shaman=7						PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Ghoran]		SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:All creatures in a 15-foot-radius burst centered on a single living creature		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]				SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:Choose a creature within range as the object of hunger. All other creatures within 15 feet of the target that can see or smell the target's delectable flesh must succeed at a Will save or spiral into a depraved state from which they gain a single purpose—to consume as much of the target's delicious flesh as possible. The creature chosen as the target of this spell is not affected by this depravity. A depraved creature gains a bite attack, two claw attacks, and the scent ability if it didn't already have them. It drops any items it was carrying and attacks the target of the spell with these natural weapons, acting as if it were confused and the target had attacked it first. This effect lasts for the spell's duration or until the depraved creature can no longer see or smell the object of its hunger for a full minute. Additionally, a depraved creature can attempt a new saving throw to end this effect at the end of any turn in which the affected creature makes an attack against the object of its hunger. If a creature that eats for nourishment succeeds at a save to end the depraved effect early, it takes a –2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, concentration checks, saving throws, and skill checks whenever it is within 15 feet of the target.

#Vine Leshy
Grasping Vine		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Druid,Occultist,Ranger,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2		PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Vine Leshy]	SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]											SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:You cause a long, thin vine to sprout from your body—typically from the center of your chest or from the palm of an outstretched hand. As a standard action, you can direct the end of the vine to move to any square within 20 feet of you and perform one of the following tasks: deliver a touch spell that you cast after the vine has grown, pick up an unattended object weighing 20 pounds or less, give a held object to another creature, attempt to disable a trap or lock using your Disable Device modifier with a –2 penalty, or perform any other task that the GM deems reasonable. The vine does not threaten squares and cannot make attacks of opportunity, nor can it wield weapons.
Leshy Swarm			TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=3						PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassAdvancedRaceSpellRestriction,1],[PRERACE:1,Vine Leshy]	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning						COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:10-ft.-square swarm of leshys										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:None		SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:You call out to nearby nature spirits and grant them temporary plant bodies. These creatures are similar to leshys, except they are Tiny and far more simpleminded. The swarm uses the statistics for a rat swarm, except it does not carry a disease or have scent. The leshy swarm has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and is immune to electricity, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep effects, sonic, and stunning. You can direct the leshy swarm to move up to its speed along a path for your choice by spending a standard action to communicate your desires through the spell, or by spending a move action if you can speak to creatures that understand only Druidic and Sylvan. The leshys are confused by their sudden possession of new bodies and assume that nearly any creature you direct them toward is a threat. They attack all creatures within their area except for you and other creatures with the plant type.
