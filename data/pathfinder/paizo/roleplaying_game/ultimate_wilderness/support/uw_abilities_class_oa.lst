#Blighted Defiler
Alignment								KEY:Blighted Defiler ~ Alignment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.BlightedDefilerClassFeatures														SOURCEPAGE:p.62		DESC:Blighted defilers must be evil in order to use steal power, since defiling the land and reaping the vulnerable for power is a particularly vile act. Nonevil blighted defilers can continue to gain kineticist levels and use their other abilities. This alters the kineticist's alignment.
Steal Power								KEY:Blighted Defiler ~ Steal Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.BlightedDefilerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural									SOURCEPAGE:p.62		DESC:%1 times per day, a blighted defiler can draw energy from the surrounding land to gather power, gaining one of the three following benefits. She can increase the burn reduction from gather power by 1 for a blast wild talent. Alternatively, she can use gather power to reduce the cost of a defense, infusion, or utility wild talent by 1, regardless of whether she gathers power for longer or has abilities that increase the burn reduction from gather power. Finally, she can siphon the energy into healing herself, recovering %2 hit points. When a blighted defiler uses steal power, she afflicts the area within a radius of %3 feet by stunting plants as the stunt growth option from diminish plants, weakening and killing minor wildlife (creatures too small or insignificant to themselves have statistics), and reducing the rate of live birth among the other surviving creatures in the area. If a blighted defiler uses steal power in an area that overlaps a previous use of her steal power within the same month, she expends a daily use and the remaining area is still blighted as above, but she doesn't gain any benefits. Steal power doesn't work in barren landscapes, the void of space, or other places without enough life to steal. This alters gather power.|STR|2*KineticistLVL|250*(min(20,KineticistLVL))
Elemental Might							KEY:Blighted Defiler ~ Elemental Might		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.BlightedDefilerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary									SOURCEPAGE:p.62		DESC:A blighted defiler uses her Strength modifier instead of her Constitution modifier to determine her damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the durations of wild talents with Constitution-based durations, her bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and other Constitution-based effects of her wild talents. She can't use abilities to substitute her Strength modifier for another ability score when determining damage from wild talents. A blighted defiler gains attack and damage bonuses from elemental overflow based on her current burn total + the number of times she successfully used steal power that day. For instance, a 9th-level blighted defiler who used steal power twice and had 1 point of burn would add a +3 bonus on attack rolls and a +6 bonus on damage rolls. A blighted defiler does not gain size bonuses to physical ability scores or a chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks from elemental overflow. This alters the key ability score of wild talents and elemental overflow.
Life Buffer								KEY:Blighted Defiler ~ Life Buffer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.BlightedDefilerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									SOURCEPAGE:p.62		DESC:A blighted defiler gains a buffer she can use to store life potential from healthy areas in order to use it later. She must use steal power on a healthy area and take none of the three usual benefits, and this doesn't count as a use of steal power for elemental might or stolen strength. This grants her buffer 1 life point. It can hold	DESC:1 life point.|!PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=11	DESC:2 life points.|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=11|!PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16	DESC:3 life points.|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16	DESC:When using steal power, she can spend 1 life point to gain the benefits even in an area she already blighted that month. Life points remain in the buffer until she spends them.
Stolen Strength							KEY:Blighted Defiler ~ Stolen Strength		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.BlightedDefilerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									SOURCEPAGE:p.62		DESC:A blighted defiler gains the ability to collect unused portions of the life she's stolen throughout the day to bolster herself. After the third time she successfully uses steal power in a given day, she gains a +2 size bonus to Strength and to either Dexterity or Constitution until she recovers uses of steal power.	DESC:After the fifth time the blighted defender successfully uses steal power in a day, she instead gains a +4 size bonus to Strength and a +2 size bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, and she can use the life energy to increase her size category by one (to a maximum of Large).|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=11	DESC:After the seventh time the blighted defender successfully uses steal power in a day, her size bonuses increase to +6 to Strength, +4 to either Dexterity or Constitution, and +2 to the remaining ability score, and she can also grow to Huge.|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16	DESC:Finally, after the 9th time she successfully uses steal power in a day, she can also grow to Gargantuan.|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=20	DESC:All of these size increases function as kinetic form, meaning they don't change her ability scores in any way. A blighted defiler can never gain an elemental defense, even from expanded defense.
Steal Life								KEY:Blighted Defiler ~ Steal Life			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.BlightedDefilerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural									SOURCEPAGE:p.63		DESC:A blighted defiler who successfully uses steal power when gathering power as a move action can use a standard action on the same turn and choose a living creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or die; this is a death effect. If the creature dies and was CR 10 or higher, on the blighted defiler's next turn, she counts as if she had used a full round to gather power with steal power. If the target survives or was lower than CR 10, she loses all benefits from both her gather power and steal power, as normal at the end of her turn.|20+STR

#Leshykineticist
Leshy Element							KEY:Leshykineticist ~ Leshy Element			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.LeshykineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											SOURCEPAGE:p.23		DESC:A leshykineticist must select the wood element (see page 58) as her primary element and for both her expanded elements. She must choose wood blast as her first simple blast and positive blast as her second simple blast. At 6th level, she gains green tongue as a bonus utility wild talent, ignoring its prerequisites. At 7th level, when she first gains positive blast, she gains kinetic healer and the photokinetic infusion instead of the extra wild talent of 3rd level or lower for expanding in the same element. Her kinetic healer wild talent restores 1 extra hit point per die when healing plant creatures. At 9th level, she gains an extra wild talent of 3rd level or lower of her choice. At 10th level, she gains greater green tongue as a bonus utility wild talent, ignoring its prerequisites. This alters element and expanded element.

Basic Leshykinesis						KEY:Leshykineticist ~ Basic Leshykinesis		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.LeshykineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											SOURCEPAGE:p.23		DESC:A vine leshy leshykineticist can use her basic phytokinesis to move while in her alternate vine form, with a base speed of 10 feet and a climb speed of 10 feet. The vine counts as a prehensile appendage for the purpose of aiming kinetic blasts and gathering power. At the GM's discretion, this ability might apply to leshykineticists of other leshy varieties as long as their alternate forms aren't rooted to the ground (and even then, they might be able to use something like a branch to aim kinetic blasts). This alters basic phytokinesis.
Photosynthetic Buffer						KEY:Leshykineticist ~ Photosynthetic Buffer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.LeshykineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											SOURCEPAGE:p.24		DESC:A leshykineticist fills her buffer with energy photosynthesized from sunlight, rather than from internal energy. Once per day, she can spend 1 hour motionless in her alternate plant form soaking in sunlight to fill her internal buffer. However, she can't fill her internal buffer by accepting burn, and her internal buffer becomes empty whenever her burn is removed. She can't benefit from any abilities that increase the maximum burn her buffer can hold. This alters internal buffer.
Green Rebirth							KEY:Leshykineticist ~ Green Rebirth			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.LeshykineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											SOURCEPAGE:p.24		DESC:At 20th level, a leshykineticist taps into the ancient power of the First World. When her verdant burst ability activates, it heals all allies and plant creatures in the area as if by a maximized version of her kinetic healer ability, rather than only 1d8 hit points. After 24 hours, one of the plants that grew in the area serves as a vessel for the leshykineticist's spirit again, allowing her to return to life without penalty. Killing all the new plants that grew from her verdant burst within 24 hours prevents her from reviving in this way.

#Terrakineticist
Terrakinesis							KEY:Terrakineticist ~ Terrakinesis			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.TerrakineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											SOURCEPAGE:p.63		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Whenever a terrakineticist gains a wild talent that isn't a universal talent, she chooses one wild talent of the appropriate level from each of the six elements (aether, air, fire, earth, water, and wood). She can use wild talents of the same element that she chose in this way to meet prerequisites for these wild talents. Instead of gaining one kineticist blast, a terrakineticist chooses one simple blast from each element that has more than one simple blast. &nl;When in a corresponding terrain, as determined by the ranger favored terrain categories, her element changes to the corresponding element (granting her class skills, basic utility wild talent, simple blast, and elemental defense as appropriate), and she gains all the wild talents she selected from the corresponding element. Aether corresponds to urban and the Ethereal Plane; air corresponds to hill, mountain, plains, and the Plane of Air; fire corresponds to desert and the Plane of Fire; earth corresponds to underground and the Plane of Earth; water corresponds to cold, swamp, water, and the Plane of Water; and wood corresponds to forest, jungle, the First World, and the Positive Energy Plane. In areas that might count as multiple types of terrain, the GM decides which element predominates, and in certain areas not covered by the ranger favored terrains (such as the upper atmosphere) or in those with strong elemental energy (like an underground temple of a fire cult), the corresponding element might differ. If the kineticist class gains additional elements, those elements also gain corresponding terrains at the GM's discretion, and the terrakineticist chooses wild talents from those elements. A terrakineticist should almost never be in a situation that doesn't correspond to any of these elements, but in such an unusual circumstance (for instance, the void of space given the standard six elements), she loses access to all her wild talents, even her universal wild talents. &nl;When her element changes, she loses the benefits of all active wild talents from the previous element, even if it would usually last until the next time she recovers burn. However, time spent in other terrain still counts against the ability's duration; if she changes back again to the original element, the benefit returns only if it has any remaining duration. This alters elemental focus and kinetic blast.
Terrakinetic Defense						KEY:Terrakineticist ~ Terrakinetic Defense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.TerrakineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											SOURCEPAGE:p.63		DESC:A terrakineticist's elemental defense wild talent changes with her corresponding element, just like her other wild talents. However, unlike her other wild talents, any burn she invests in one element's elemental defense carries over to her elemental defense when her element changes. For instance, if a 6th-level terrakineticist invested 2 points of burn in flesh of stone to gain 2 additional points of damage reduction and then entered a city and changed to aether, she would have 2 points of burn invested in force ward and increase the force ward's temporary hit points by 6. This alters elemental defense.
Expanded Terrakinesis						KEY:Terrakineticist ~ Expanded Terrakinesis	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.TerrakineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											SOURCEPAGE:p.63		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] A terrakineticist gains both simple blasts for the element corresponding to her current terrain, if that element has two, and the composite blast associated with expanding in that element (force blast, thunderstorm blast, blue flame blast, metal blast, ice blast, and verdant blast). She also gains a universal infusion or utility talent for which she meets the prerequisites. At 15th level, she gains one infusion or utility wild talent for which she meets the prerequisites.
Omniterrakinesis							KEY:Terrakineticist ~ Omniterrakinesis		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Features.TerrakineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									SOURCEPAGE:p.63		DESC:A terrakineticist can accept 1 point of burn as a free action at the start of her turn to change her element without regard to the surrounding terrain until the beginning of her next turn.

If the ruin has been claimed as a lair for a creature, the DC of this check is equal to 10 + the CR of the most powerful creature in the ruin. If the ruin holds a magic item (or multiple magic items), the DC of this check is equal to 11 + the highest caster level of all the magic items in the ruin. If the occult historian succeeds at the check, she learns the layout of the area of the ruin within 30 feet of her (including any secret doors), as well as a piece of information about the structure's history (as determined by the GM).
