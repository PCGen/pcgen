Alignment									KEY:Flood Walker ~ Alignment												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.FloodWalkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												DESC:Flood walkers exult in the final gasp for air of a drowning victim and must be evil in alignment. A flood walker who becomes nonevil loses access to all abilities granted by this archetype but does not regain any abilities this archetype replaced.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Gasping Breath Aura							KEY:Flood Walker ~ Gasping Breath Aura										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.FloodWalkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										DESC:A creature attempting to hold its breath within 30 feet of a flood walker is treated as having taken a standard or full-round action when determining how long it can hold its breath, regardless of the number and type of actions it takes in a round.	DESC:Increase the DC of Swim checks attempted within 30 feet of the flood walker by 5, and creatures actively engaged in combat or a similarly strenuous activity use air twice as quickly within the aura. The flood walker can exempt creatures within this aura from these increased penalties.|PRECLASS:1,Witch=5																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.89
River Stride								KEY:Flood Walker ~ River Stride											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.FloodWalkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										DESC:A flood walker and his familiar can walk on the surface of water and other liquids as if under the effects of a water walk spell. The flood walker chooses at the beginning of his turn each round whether this ability is active or suppressed (for himself and his familiar separately), allowing him to walk on water or swim.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Breath Siphon								KEY:Flood Walker ~ Breath Siphon											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.FloodWalkerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										DESC:A flood walker gains strength from his patron when creatures suffocate or drown. Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher asphyxiates or drowns within 30 feet of him, the flood walker gains the benefit of a death knell spell for 1 hour. If a flood walker drowns such a victim himself (such as by holding a grappled or helpless creature under water until it dies or by killing it with a suffocation spell), the duration is doubled, and the flood walker gains 4d8 temporary hit points and a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength instead of the usual temporary hit points and enhancement bonus to Strength from death knell. Like death knell itself, this is an evil act.
