Weapon and Armor Proficiencies					KEY:Shifter ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiencies									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape. Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood. A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

Bonus Languages								KEY:Shifter ~ Bonus Languages												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:A shifter's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race. A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn't take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.

She can shift into her aspect's minor form for %1 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter's turn. Until a shifter gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects. As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects.|ShifterAspectMinutes																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Shifter Aspect Choice|ShifterAspectCount																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:VAR|ShifterAspectMinutes|ShifterLVL+3	BONUS:VAR|ShifterAspectCount|1+min(3,(ShifterLVL/5))	BONUS:VAR|ShifterAspectLVL|ShifterLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.26				ASPECT:CheckType|Minutes per Day	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|ShifterAspectMinutes	ASPECT:MasterAbility|Shifter Aspect
Shifter Claws								KEY:Shifter ~ Shifter Claws												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																					DEFINE:ShifterClawDamage|0																																				DESC:At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter's faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d%1 points of piercing and slashing damage. If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.|ShifterClawDamage	DESC:Her claws count as magic weapons and ignore DR/cold iron, and DR/silver.|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,3|PREVARLT:ShifterLVL,19	DESC:Her claws count as magic weapons and ignore DR/cold iron, DR/silver,DR/adamantine and DR/-.|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,19	DESC:The critical multiplier for her claws becomes x3.|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,17	DESC:While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect's major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form's claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterWildShape,1																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Shifter Claw																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|4|PRESIZEEQ:M	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|3|PRESIZEEQ:S	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|6|PRESIZEEQ:L	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|1|PRESIZEEQ:S|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,7	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|2|PRESIZEGTEQ:M|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,7	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|2|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,11	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawDamage|2|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,13	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawSize|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,7	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawSize|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,11	BONUS:VAR|ShifterClawSize|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,13													BONUS:WEAPONPROF=Shifter Claw|CRITMULTADD|1|PREVARGTEQ:ShifterLVL,17																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Wild Empathy								KEY:Shifter ~ Wild Empathy												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													DESC:A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Core Rulebook p93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

Woodland Stride								KEY:Shifter ~ Woodland Stride												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													DESC:A shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.

Wild Shape									KEY:Shifter ~ Wild Shape												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DruidWildShape																																																																																																																																																																																				QUALIFY:ABILITY=FEAT|Natural Spell	SERVESAS:ABILITY=Special Ability|Wild Shape		DEFINE:ShifterWildShape|0	DEFINE:ShifterWildshapeCount|0																														DESC:A shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect's major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent. A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies. A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level. A shifter can use wild shape for %1 hours each day. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on 'uses of wild shape,' each hour of wild shape counts as a use.|ShifterWildshapeCount																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|ShifterWildShape|1	BONUS:VAR|ShifterWildshapeCount|ShifterLVL+WIS																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.27

Shifter's Fury								KEY:Shifter ~ Shifter's Fury												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													DESC:A shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a -5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don't benefit from shifter's claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a -10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at -15.

This works like purify food and drink for a maximum volume of water equal to 1 gallon for each level the alchemist has x the level of the extract slot the alchemist used to create the tablet. Additionally, if the alchemist has a receptacle of sufficient volume to gather the water, the tablet doubles the volume of pure water. The water volume increases over the course of 1 minute, but the effect stops before it can create significant water pressure on a container that's not large enough to hold the entire volume. An unused tablet remains usable until the next time the alchemist recovers extract slots.

For example, he automatically adds summon nature's ally I to his formula book at 1st level and adds the next higher-level spell to his formula book each time he gains the ability to use extracts of that level. The horticulturist uses these special extracts to plant a seed that grows into a creature, bypassing the restriction for single target or personal effects. Using these extracts takes 1 round (as the spell's normal casting time), and the creature summoned must be placed in a space adjacent to the horticulturist. The horticulturist can use these extracts to summon only animals and plants on the appropriate summon nature's ally list. Creatures the horticulturist summons with these extracts become creatures with the plant type (gaining low-light vision and immunity to mind-affecting, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning effects) rather than their normal type, but their attack bonuses, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills don't change.

An alchemist's extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells or deliver touch spells.

The prejudice and misunderstanding with which civilized folk often regard barbarians is often even more pronounced in the case of these belligerent outcasts from society, in large part due to the fact that brutish swampers deliberately mock and antagonize the so-called "city folk." To a brutish swamper, an urban lifestyle is one that breeds weakness and lassitude in the body. The brutish swamper has little interest or patience in maintaining alliances or friendship with those who live such soft lifestyles, and this aggression only further encourages feelings of prejudice on both sides of the cultural divide. When a brutish swamper joins an adventuring party, they usually come to value the skills and talents of their more urbanized companions, but never fully understand the desire to live lives surrounded by creature comforts.

While this lifestyle doesn't in and of itself imply evil or sinister intent, many outlanders ignorantly assume that cave dwellers avoid the light of the sun for malicious reasons. In truth, cave dwellers are as capable of goodness and kindness as any other-they just see little reason to venture out of their preferred homelands.

Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action to create a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the hunter had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If the trap is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (attempting a saving throw, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and penalties from range increments apply on the attack roll. The duration of the trap starts when it is created, not when it is triggered.

Drawing the map takes 10 minutes. While he is within the studied area, the cartographer can use inspiration on Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Ride, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill. If he already has the ability to use inspiration on any of these skills without expending a use of inspiration, he gains an additional +1 bonus on checks with that skill while in the studied area. A cartographer can draw three types of maps. He cannot combine different map types in the same map, and areas within range that would belong in the other categories are excluded. Much like alchemy, cartography requires materials, but the cost of those materials is negligible. However, knowing an area so well as to gain these benefits requires more than just paper and ink-a great deal of memorization and a bit of inspiration are also required. For this reason, a cartographer can maintain these benefits in only one area at a time.

Astrology									KEY:Star Watcher ~ Astrology												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Investigator Class Features.StarWatcherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:A star watcher studies a symbolic language of the heavens known as astrology. Equal parts art form and science, astrology can be used to read the future and affect it in subtle ways. Much like an alchemist or investigator, a star watcher collects formulae in a formula book. However, the formulae resemble star charts, and unlike alchemists or normal investigators, he uses these formulae along with personal details and astronomical measurements to make horoscopes-magical calculations stored much like scrolls-in which he can store spells. In many ways, the star watcher's horoscopes function like extracts, with the following exceptions. A star watcher's horoscope is always keyed to a specific creature that must be willing and present when the star watcher prepares the horoscope. Only the creature to which a horoscope is keyed can activate it and be affected by it. A horoscope is "cast" by reading it as a standard action, though a star watcher can draw and read a horoscope as a single standard action. A star watcher doesn't gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, a star watcher cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents. A star watcher can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's formula book to learn formulae, but a star watcher's formula book is too esoteric for anyone except another star watcher to learn spells from.

A creature successfully damaged by the wasteland meditant's unarmed strike must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1) or begin to calcify.

These effects take place every round at the start of the wasteland meditant's turn and continue for %1 rounds. If the target is reduced to 0 Strength or Dexterity at any time during this duration, the creature is instantly killed and its body is transformed into a pillar of salt. A creature killed in this way can't be brought back to life except by miracle, true resurrection, or wish. Total immersion in water suppresses the ongoing effects of pillar of salt but resets the accumulated natural armor bonus to zero.

Devastating Form								KEY:Rageshaper ~ Devastating Form											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shifter Class Features.RageshaperClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									DESC:A rageshaper can enter a state of intense fury, transforming into a living engine of destruction. This ability functions as the barbarian's rage class feature, except entering this state of fury requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and has additional effects as noted below. At the start of the rageshaper's next turn, he not only gains the benefit of rage but also grows one size category larger (though worn equipment and held items do not increase in size). Armor or clothing the rageshaper wears that doesn't accommodate his changing size immediately gains the broken condition. If insufficient room is available to accommodate this change, the rageshaper attains the maximum possible size for the available space and can attempt a Strength check (using his increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If the check fails, he is constrained but not harmed by the materials enclosing him. A rageshaper can remain in his devastating form for %1 rounds per day. He can dismiss devastating form only with a successful Will save (DC %2) made as a free action. On a failed save, the attempted remains in devastating form for an additional round. If the rageshaper does not successfully end his devastating form before he runs out of daily rounds, the next time he fails his Will save to revert, he flies into an uncontrollable frenzy as if affected by confusion, but he treats a roll of 26-50 as "attacks nearest creature." Each round the rageshaper spends in an uncontrollable frenzy, the Will save DC to exit devastating form decreases by 2. When a rageshaper ends his devastating form ability, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds he spent in devastating form. A rageshaper cannot enter devastating form again while fatigued or exhausted. If a rageshaper falls unconscious, his devastating form ends immediately. At 10th level, the rageshaper can grow up to a maximum of two size categories larger with devastating form and his rage is now treated as greater rage. At 20th level, the rageshaper can grow up to a maximum of three size categories larger with devastating form and his rage is treated as mighty rage.|ShifterLVL|10+ShifterLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.82

When the eidolon is summoned in an environment matching one of these base forms, the leshy caller can change the eidolon's base form to the matching form by sacrificing one daily use of her summon nature's ally ability as a free action.
