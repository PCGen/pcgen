Unshakable Chill.MOD		DESC:Mythic: On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any other Fortitude saves the target attempts to resist severe cold as part of the spell's effects. The target also takes a -4 penalty on saves against spells or effects with the cold descriptor. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target gains vulnerability to fire (Bestiary 305).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Unshakable Chill
Vampiric Touch.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8). Your melee touch attack to deliver the spell threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. This expanded threat range doesn't stack with other effects or abilities that increase the threat range. If the damage kills the target, you gain fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the target.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Vampiric Touch
Vomit Twin.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium, or long can originate from the twin instead of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your tier, and has hit points equal to double your caster level. The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast mythic vomit twin. If the twin's weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon's die type. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Vomit Twin
Walk through Space.MOD		DESC:Mythic: You can teleport as either a move action or a swift action, but never more than once per round. If you expend a move action and a swift action, you may teleport up to 60 feet.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Walk Through Space
Wall of Fire.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet, 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet, and 2d8 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. Any creature that passes through the wall or is within 5 feet of the wall when it's created must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you may move the wall 5 feet in any direction as a move action on your turn. Moving the wall into a fireproof barrier (such as a stone wall) destroys the part of the wall that overlaps the barrier.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Fire
Wall of Force.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall's hardness increases to 40, and its hit points increase to 30 per caster level. A nonmythic disintegrate spell or rod of cancellation negates a 10-footsquare section of a mythic wall of force for 1 round, after which the wall reforms at full strength. One side of the wall (chosen by you) repels creatures within 5 feet as a repulsion spell (using the DC wall of force would have if it allowed a saving throw).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Force
Wall of Ice.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall's hit points increase to 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Add your tier to the Strength check DC to break through the wall. The damage dealt to those that step through the wall increases to 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level. Any creature that passes through the wall must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds; this is a cold effect. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you cover the wall in sharp, protruding icicles. Any creature that touches, strikes, or breaks through the wall takes 1d6 points of cold damage, 1d6 points of piercing damage, and 1 point of bleed damage.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Ice
Wall of Iron.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. If you create an unattached wall, you can weight it so there is a 75%% chance it falls on its own in the direction you want. Subtract 5 from the DC to push it in the direction you want, and add 5 to the DC to push the wall in the other direction. Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, one side of the wall (your choice) has a powerful magnetic charge that attracts metal within 10 feet. The wall automatically attempts a combat maneuver check to pull once per round against any creature that comes in range wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or otherwise carrying a significant amount of metal. The wall's CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier. If the combat maneuver succeeds, the creature is pulled 5 feet closer to the wall. The wall gains a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check if the creature is within 5 feet. If the wall succeeds at its check against a creature within 5 feet, the creature is pulled up against the wall and is treated as grappled. Dropping metal items or removing metal armor allows a creature to free itself from the wall. The magnetic charge fades after 1 hour per tier. Wrenching an item away from the wall requires a successful Strength check (DC 10 + the wall's CMB).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Iron
Wall of Stone.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. The wall's hardness increases to 12. Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall is impassable to ethereal travel and spells such as passwall and phase door. The wall is immune to non-mythic disintegrate, shatter, sympathetic vibration, and other nonmythic magical effects that specifically affect stone (including earthquake, soften earth and stone, and transmute rock to mud).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Stone
Wall of Thorns.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The damage dealt increases to 30 minus the creature's AC. Any creature adjacent to the wall is automatically grappled by it. Any creature that begins its turn grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of damage. Half of this damage is bludgeoning, and the other half is piercing. For the purpose of escaping this grapple, the wall's CMD is 10 + your caster level + your tier. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall automatically grapples creatures other than you within 10 feet. Any creature grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of bleed damage. If a creature doesn't escape the wall's grapple, on its next turn the wall automatically pins it.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Thorns
Web.MOD				DESC:Mythic: The webs are filled with spider swarms (one spider swarm for each 10-foot-by-10-foot area covered in webs). Any creature caught in or moving through the webs is attacked by a spider swarm (or multiple swarms, if it passes through the space of more than one swarm). The spiders don't leave the area of webbing. Destroying the web in an area destroys the swarm there as well, and completely destroying the web destroys all the swarms. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the webs increase to a 50-foot-radius spread. Webs span any gaps between available anchor points in the area, possibly creating multiple non-contiguous webbed areas. Non-mythic abilities that make creatures immune to webs (such as freedom of movement) instead give them a +5 bonus on saves, combat maneuver checks, and Escape Artist checks against mythic web.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Web
Whirlwind.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The cyclone becomes 15 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top, and 40 feet tall. The cyclone's effect on Large or smaller creatures also applies to Huge creatures, and its damage increases to 3d8 points of damage. The effect on Medium or smaller creatures also applies to Large creatures, and the damage it deals each turn increases to 2d6 points of damage. Augmented (8th): If you expend three uses of mythic power, the cyclone's size increases to 50 feet wide at the base, 150 feet wide at the top, and 150 feet tall. Creatures and objects of all sizes touched by the whirlwind take 8d8 points of damage (Reflex negates), and the damage dealt to those trapped in the cyclone increases to 6d6 points of damage per round. Additionally, unattended objects smaller than 30 feet to a side are swept up in the effect. The area within 20 feet of the whirlwind is treated as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439), and within 40 feet it is treated as strong wind.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Whirlwind
Wish.MOD				DESC:Mythic: When using mythic wish to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power to duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell. You can also produce any one of the following effects that modify or replace effects listed in the non-mythic wish spell description: * If you use mythic wish to remove injuries and afflictions, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power to remove that number of additional afflictions from all affected creatures. * If you use mythic wish to revive the dead, you can expend a second use of mythic power to negate the target's permanent negative level from the resurrection. * Alter fate. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can cast mythic wish as an immediate action before a 1d20 roll is attempted and choose what number you want to come up on the die. Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled mythic wish, even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wish
Word of Chaos.MOD			DESC:Mythic: When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Non-chaotic creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Word of Chaos

The creatures immediately gain the benefits of their chosen paths. Divide the duration evenly among all targets. The targets retain their mythic tier only while they're within 100 feet of the spell's focus component. A target that goes outside this range loses its mythic tier, but instantly regains it if it moves into range again. If the focus component is destroyed while the spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.

Bleed Glory			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Necromancy		DESCRIPTOR:Curse	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:one mythic creature				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:The mythic power cost for all path abilities, feats, spells, and other effects used by the target increases by 1.
Deathless			CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Necromancy					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:living creature touched				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) round		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:The target's soul is strongly anchored to its body, preventing death from hit point damage. No matter how low the target's hit points get, it remains alive (though not necessarily conscious). This spell doesn't prevent death from sources other than hit point damage-such as Constitution damage or drain, death effects, or energy drain. Spells that cure hit points affect the creature normally.
Lend Path			CLASSES:Bard,Magus=4|Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:creature touched					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You temporarily transfer one of your mythic path abilities to another creature, which can use it as if it were part of the creature's own path. If the target is unable to expend mythic power, it can't activate any part of the ability that requires expending uses of mythic power, but the ability otherwise functions as if the creature were 1st tier. While your path ability is transferred in this way, you can't use it yourself (even if it's an automatic ability or one that doesn't require expending uses of mythic power).
Mythic Severance		CLASSES:Inquisitor=3|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Necromancy		DESCRIPTOR:Curse	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:one creature						DURATION:Permanent				SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You restrict the target's access to its mythic power. Each time the target attempts to cast a mythic spell, expend mythic power to activate a path ability, or use any other effect that requires expending uses of mythic power, it must attempt a Will saving throw against the DC of this spell. If it fails this saving throw, the creature loses its action and the ability it was attempting to use has no effect. This spell has no effect on mythic abilities that don't require the target to expend mythic power.
Restore Mythic Power	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:you and one mythic creature			DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:By laying your hands on the target, you're able to transfer some of your mythic essence to the target. You expend three uses of your mythic power to restore one use of the target's mythic power.
Share Glory			CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3		SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL/3) non-mythic creature		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You imbue the targets with a fraction of your mythic nature. They count as mythic creatures for the purpose of path abilities, spells, and other effects that function differently for mythic creatures. This doesn't grant the targets mythic tiers or any uses of mythic power; it merely gives them a greater advantage when others use abilities that work differently for mythic creatures. You must be at least a 1st-tier mythic character to cast this spell.
Steal Power			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5				SCHOOL:Necromancy					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:one mythic creature				DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You sap the power from a mythic creature, using it to restore your own. The target loses 1d4 uses of mythic power. If you have the ability to expend mythic power, you regain one use for each use the target loses.
Terraform			CLASSES:Druid=6|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7			SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:100 feet	TARGETAREA:100-foot-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) days (see text)	SAVEINFO:none					SPELLRES:no			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment. You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change. Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts. If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.
