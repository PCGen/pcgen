If you're 5th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 10 years per tier. If you're 5th tier and expend four uses of mythic power, the spell has both augmented effects. Creatures sleeping for years because of this spell age and breathe as normal, but don't need to eat or drink while the spell lasts.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Deep Slumber
Defile Armor.MOD			DESC:Mythic: You gain DR 5/good while wearing the target armor. While using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/good.

Detect Scrying.MOD		DESC:Mythic: This spell automatically gives you a visual image of the creature scrying you. If it's using a non-mythic means of scrying, you also gain an accurate sense of its direction and distance from you. You automatically succeed at caster level checks to overcome nondetection or similar effects (other than mind blank) that block your ability to detect the creature. If you learn the creature's direction and distance with this spell, you can, as an immediate action, cast a mind-affecting spell through the scrying sensor to target the creature. This spell affects only the scrying creature, even if the spell normally affects an area or multiple targets. You must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the level of the spell you wish to cast against the creature. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, even mind blank doesn't prevent you from detecting the scrying creature. If you teleport to the creature's location within 1 minute, you arrive on target (with no chance of error) and bypass non-mythic effects that block teleportation. Alternatively, you can compel the creature to attempt to teleport to you within 1 minute (Will negates, DC equal to 10 plus double your tier). It must use its own means of teleportation to do so, but you guarantee it arrives on target and bypasses non-mythic effects that block teleportation to your location.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Detect Scrying

When casting the spell, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. These creatures can see and use the portal, passing through it to arrive at the destination (this isn't an action). A creature that passes through the portal can't take any other actions until its next turn.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Dimension Door
Dimensional Lock.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The spell doesn't interfere with your extradimensional travel spells and effects. Augmented (4th): You can augment mythic dimensional lock to redirect teleporting creatures to another location. If you expend two uses of mythic power, designate a location that you're very familiar with. This location must be on the same plane as you. Any creature attempting to use extradimensional travel from outside the spell's area into that area is instead redirected to this other location. The creature can attempt a Spellcraft check against your caster level. If it succeeds, it's aware of the redirection (though not the destination) and can interrupt its spellcasting, losing the spell but not teleporting.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Dimensional Lock

Disintegrate.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 60d6) plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 5d8 points of damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage. A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this spell is entirely disintegrated. Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,you fire two rays. Alternatively, you may fire only one ray, but if the target is a non-mythic creature and it fails its saving throw, it's automatically disintegrated regardless of its current hp.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Disintegrate
Dispel Magic.MOD			DESC:Mythic: When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell.

If you use this spell to counterspell, roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Dispel Magic

Dominate Person.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The Sense Motive DC to notice your target is dominated increases by double your tier. You can give orders to the target even if it's protected by non-mythic effects that block magical control, such as protection from evil. If the target is protected by a mythic effect, you can attempt to overcome this defense with a caster level check (DC 15 plus the caster level of the effect); add your tier to your roll and the opposing caster's tier to the DC. If the target succeeds at its Will save to break your control, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to force it to reroll the save and use the lower result.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Dominate Person
Draconic Reservoir.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The amount of energy damage the spell absorbs increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points).

Dream.MOD				DESC:Mythic: You or the messenger may gain information from the dreamer you contact by asking questions as if using speak with dead to speak with a corpse.

Answers to these questions are still generally brief and cryptic.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Dream
Dust of Twilight.MOD		DESC:Mythic: A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the Sleep spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the lullaby spell).

Hideous Laughter.MOD		DESC:Mythic: A creature of a type different than your own doesn't gain a bonus on its saving throws against this spell. The affected target laughs so hard it hurts, and takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round it spends laughing. If the target fails its initial save, it must succeed at two follow-up saving throws (each a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity) to end the spell. Succeeding at only one save means the spell no longer deals damage, but the target is still unable to take actions. Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target's laughter becomes contagious. When the target's allies are within 30 feet and can hear the laugh, they must successfully save against the spell or be sickened until the target stops laughing.

Freezing cold water hardens into ice on the ground (Core Rulebook 442), lasting as long as prevailing conditions allow.

Ice Storm.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The bludgeoning damage increases to 4d8 points of damage and the cold damage increases to 3d6 points of damage.

Ill Omen.MOD			DESC:Mythic: For the target's unlucky d20 rolls, it must roll three times and take the lowest result. Spending a move action to utter a prayer or good luck charm allows the target to roll twice instead of three times.

Any natural 20 it rolls counts as a natural 1 instead.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Ill Omen

Irresistible Dance.MOD		DESC:Mythic: When casting the spell, you can choose to make the dance either an unending dance or a dance of death. A target affected by unending dance receives a new saving throw at the end of each round of dancing, even if its initial save was successful. If the save fails, the duration of the spell increases by 1 round. A target affected by the dance of death suffers excruciating pain that inflicts a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round it spends dancing. With either form, you can direct the creature like a marionetteas a move action, causing it to take a single move action at half its speed along the path you specify. You must have line of sight to the target and be within Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) to command its movement.

Jitterbugs.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Starting on the second round of the spell, the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save on your turn or be nauseated for 1 round, as if distracted by an actual swarm.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Jitterbugs

The spell automatically opens locks of simple or average quality, without requiring a caster level check to do so. If used on a door locked with arcane lock, you can attempt a free dispel check against it as if using a targeted dispel magic, adding your tier to the check. Augmented (3rd): You can expend two uses of mythic power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an arcane lock on each, and automatically opening locks of up to good quality (no caster level check needed). If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the door is unlocked but doesn't automatically open. The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Knock
Know the Enemy.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The insight bonus increases to +15 plus your tier. If the check is successful, you gain a +5 insight bonus on your next attack roll or saving throw against a creature of that type, as long as the roll occurs within 24 hours of casting the spell.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Know the Enemy
Levitate.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Instead of affecting one creature, you can affect a number of targets up to your caster level, but the total weight supported can be no more than 100 pounds per caster level.

Augmented (8th): If you expend 10 uses of mythic power, you permanently levitate a 5-foot cube of rock, which you canmove 20 feet vertically or horizontally as a move action. If you have created multiple cubes and they are physically touching each other, you can direct them all as a single move action (as if they were one object), even if some of them are out of range.

You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to natural attacks or unarmed strikes affected by the spell: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering. You must choose only one with each casting of the spell. For example, you can't add flaming to a tiger's bite and keen to its claws with the same casting.

Memory Lapse.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of the turn before its last turn. Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using modify memory but limited to that short period of time. For example, you couldn't implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as that couldn't happen in the forgotten length of time. The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the mythic memory lapse DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the target still forgets the allotted time.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Memory Lapse
Meteor Swarm.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The meteors created by this spell deal bludgeoning damage in a line extending from you to the target destination where it explodes. Creatures in the path of a meteor take 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. The damage from the exploding meteors increases to 6d10 points of fire damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves against the fire damage are also knocked prone and deafened for 1d4 rounds.

You may affect multiple memories with one casting of the spell, as long as the total number of minutes doesn't exceed this limit. Each affected memory counts as a minimum of 5 minutes. For example, you could implant a memory of having a brief meeting with the mayor before lunch and another brief meeting just after dinner, even though the two events would have been hours apart. Augmented (8th): If you expend four uses of mythic power, instead of altering the target's memories, you alter all other creatures' memories of the target (only the target gets a saving throw against the spell). All creatures on the same plane as the target forget his name, their relationship to him, and everything he has done; he is essentially a stranger to them. Any important acts by the target are attributed to someone else. Everyone's memories of history are rewritten to incorporate this change. The target's memories are unaffected. You can exclude a number of other creatures up to your tier from the effects of this spell (so they remember the truth), including yourself if you wish. Written records are unchanged unless you expend an additional six uses of mythic power when you cast the spell, and written records on other planes remain unchanged regardless.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Modify Memory

Phantasmal Killer.MOD		DESC:Mythic: If the target fails its Will save but succeeds at its Fortitude save, the phantasmal killer persists in the target's mind, giving it the dazed condition until your next turn. On your next turn, the target must attempt another Fortitude save against the phantasm. Success means it takes 3d6 points of damage; failure means it dies from fear. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can affect a living target that is immune to fear, illusions, or mind-affecting effects.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Phantasmal Killer
Phantom Steed.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The steed's rider automatically succeeds at Ride checks to remain mounted. The mount's hit points increase to 10 plus 2 per caster level, and its speed increases to 30 feet per 2 caster levels (maximum 150 feet). Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the phantom steed is incorporeal, but its rider can interact with it normally.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Phantom Steed
Pillar of Life.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The damage healed increases to 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The damage dealt to undead increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6 points of damage per caster level for undead vulnerable to bright light (maximum 20d6). If a dead creature is brought into the pillar's square and that creature could be revived by breath of life, the pillar of life ends and the creature returns to life as per breath of life.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Pillar of Life
Plane Shift.MOD			DESC:Mythic: If you've been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell. Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a planar adaptation spell (Advanced Player's Guide 236) upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Plane Shift
Polar Ray.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d8) and 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. If the target takes damage from this spell, it becomes partially encased in ice, reducing its speed by half. Creatures with the cold or incorporeal subtypes or immunity to being grappled are immune to this effect. The reduced movement lasts until the ice is destroyed. Destroying the ice requires a successful Strength or dispel check against the spell's DC or dealing 1 point of bludgeoning or fire damage per caster level to the target.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Polar Ray
Power Word Blind.MOD		DESC:Mythic: Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting mythic power word blind would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would permanently blind the target. You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to treat all opponents as though they had concealment (20%% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds. Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit points are reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell's effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For example, a creature in the 101-200 hp category reduced to 80 hp immediately becomes blinded for 1d4+1 minutes instead of 1d4+1 rounds. The spell's effects don't diminish if the target regains hit points.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Power Word Blind
Power Word Kill.MOD		DESC:Mythic: Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting mythic power word kill would instantly kill a creature with 85 hit points or fewer. You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to become exhausted. Augmented (6th): If you expend four uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit point total drops to the point that this spell would have killed it upon casting, it's instantly slain.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Power Word Kill
Power Word Stun.MOD		DESC:Mythic: Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting this spell would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would last an additional 2d4 rounds. You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to become dazed for 1 round. Augmented (6th): If you expend three uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit points are reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell's effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For example, a creature in the 101-150 hp category reduced to 80 hp is immediately stunned for an additional 1d4 rounds. The spell's effects don't diminish if the target regains hit points.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Power Word Stun
Pox Pustules.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The Dexterity penalty increases to -6. The target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round. If the target spends a move action scratching, increase its bleed damage each round by 1.

Prayer.MOD				DESC:Mythic: The spell's luck bonus increases to +2, and the penalty for enemies changes to -2.

Prismatic Sphere.MOD		DESC:Mythic: When you cast the spell, you simultaneously create a prismatic spray that originates from one point on the sphere and radiates directly away from you. The save DC of this prismatic spray is the same as that of your mythic prismatic sphere.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Prismatic Sphere
Prismatic Spray.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The spell automatically blinds creatures with up to 12 Hit Dice instead of 8 Hit Dice. Attempt one bull rush combat maneuver and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area changes from a cone into a line. Creatures in the line are struck by two beams (or three, if the creature rolls an 8 on the table). The spell bypasses energy resistance and immunity.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Prismatic Spray
Protection from Arrows.MOD	DESC:Mythic: The damage reduction increases to 15/magic. The maximum damage prevented by the spell increases to 15 points per caster level (maximum 150 points). If the spell prevents all damage from a ranged weapon attack, it turns the projectile or weapon back on the attacker, using the same attack roll result. If the attacker is also protected by mythic protection from arrows and its spell completely prevents the damage from the rebounded attack, the weapon or projectile is destroyed.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Protection from Arrows
Protection from Chaos.MOD	DESC:Mythic: As mythic protection from evil, except against chaotic creatures.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Protection from Chaos
Protection from Evil.MOD	DESC:Mythic: The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4. Any evil creature attempting to possess or exercise mental control over the target must attempt a Will save against this spell. If it fails, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) from mental feedback. An evil creature that uses spell resistance to bypass the spell's protection against contact must successfully save or take this damage once each round it attacks the protected target.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Protection from Evil
Protection from Good.MOD	DESC:Mythic: As mythic protection from evil, except against good creatures.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Protection from Good

Ray of Enfeeblement.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The Strength penalty increases to 1d8 + 1 per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the target fails its save, it's fatigued.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Ray of Enfeeblement
Reduce Person.MOD			DESC:Mythic: You can decrease the target's size by up to two categories, to a minimum of Tiny. If the target shrinks two sizes, its weight decreases by a factor of 16 and it gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity, a -4 size penalty to Strength, and a +2 bonus on attack rolls and to AC because of its decreased size. A Medium or Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet. Mythic reduce person counters and dispels mythic enlarge person.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Reduce Person
Regenerate.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a vorpal weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as breath of life), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Regenerate
Repel Wood.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The casting time changes to 1 immediate action. You may cause one affected wooden object up to 5 inches in diameter to splinter and break.

Resist Energy.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The target gains a +4 bonus on saves against effects that deal damage of the selected energy type. Once each round as a free action, the target can choose one adjacent ally to gain energy resistance 5 against the chosen energy type for 1 round. This increases to energy resistance 10 at caster level 7 and energy resistance 15 at caster level 11.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Resist Energy
Resonating Word.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The damage dealt increases to 8d6 points on the 1st and 2nd rounds and 15d6 on the 3rd round. The target takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against all sonic effects.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Resonating Word
Reverse Gravity.MOD		DESC:Mythic: Creatures in the area or that enter the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated. Augmented (8th): If you expend three uses of mythic power, once per round as a move action you may select one secured creature (one that succeeded at its Reflex save) or attached object (such as a tree or cottage) and force it to attempt a Fortitude save against the spell. The selected creature or object can weigh no more than 100 pounds per caster level. If it fails the save, it's pulled free and falls upward.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Reverse Gravity
Ricochet Shot.MOD			DESC:Mythic: If the attack hits the secondary target, the wielder can select a tertiary target within 20 feet of the secondary target. This functions like a ricochet off the primary target. The tertiary target must be a different creature than the primary target. Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the secondary and tertiary attacks gain the enhancement bonus and magic qualities of the attack against the primary target.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Ricochet Shot
Sacred Bond.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The range at which you and the target can cast conjuration (healing) spells on each other increases to medium (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level). When you or the target uses the sacred bond to cast a healing spell on the other, the caster also heals a number of hit points equal to the minimum amount the spell can heal. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, casting a healing spell through the link heals the caster the normal amount instead of the minimum amount. You and the target can use the link to heal each other with targeted healing abilities such as lay on hands. Unlike with healing spells, a character using a healing ability in this way doesn't heal herself.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Sacred Bond
Sanctify Armor.MOD		DESC:Mythic: You gain DR 5/evil while wearing the target armor. While you're using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/evil. Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a sacred bonus.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Sanctify Armor
Sanctuary.MOD			DESC:Mythic: If an attacker succeeds at its Will save to attack the protected target, add your tier to the target's AC against the attack. If the target uses a healing spell or ability on another creature, that creature gains the benefit of non-mythic sanctuary for 1 round. If the creature breaks the non-mythic sanctuary by attacking, subsequent healing by the target doesn't create another nonmythic sanctuary effect on the creature. Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, select a number of additional creatures equal to half your tier that are within reach. These creatures gain the benefit of nonmythic sanctuary.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Sanctuary
Sands of Time.MOD			DESC:Mythic: You age the target by two categories instead of one. The damage dealt to objects, constructs, and undead increases to 5d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Augmented (8th): If you expend four uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous. If the target is a living creature, its age increases to venerable, regardless of its current age. A non-mythic creature receives no saving throw against this, but a mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save against the spell's DC to reduce the duration to 10 minutes per level and the effect to two age categories instead of automatically changing to venerable. If the target is an object, construct, or undead, it takes 30 points of damage per caster level. A mythic creature that succeeds at a Fortitude takes only half damage.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Sands of Time
Saving Finale.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Add your tier as a bonus on the saving throw reroll.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Saving Finale

You must either describe the intended recipients in general or specific terms (such as "orcs," "the queen of this country," or "left-handed half-elven males") or specify restrictions such as range, creature type, and alignment (such as "all good-aligned humanoids in the castle on the hill"). If a greater number of creatures meet your description than the maximum number you can send to, the closest ones to you receive the message.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Sending
Shadow Anchor.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as if it had cast shadow walk (if the target could not reach the Shadow Plane from its current location using shadow walk, this aspect of the spell has no effect).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Shadow Anchor
Shadow Weapon.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Add your tier to your caster level when determining what enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities the weapon can have. The weapon deals half damage to creatures that disbelieve in it and to objects, instead of only 1 point.

Shatter.MOD				DESC:Mythic: Add your tier to your caster level when determining the maximum object weight you can affect. When targeting a crystalline creature, the spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d8).

Shield of Faith.MOD		DESC:Mythic: Add half your tier to the spell's deflection bonus.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Shield of Faith
Shield Other.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Increase the range to long (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level). Subtract your tier from any damage transmitted to you through the mystical connection before applying the damage (minimum 1 hp of damage). When you use your surge ability to modify a saving throw against an effect that also affects your linked ally, the ally also applies your surge bonus die result to the ally's saving throw. If the ally also uses its own surge ability, it takes either your result or its result, whichever is higher.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Shield Other
Shocking Grasp.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d8). If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you may attempt a free grapple combat maneuver against the target.

Stoneskin.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease, poison, and stun effects. There is a 50%% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against the target is treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing medium fortification armor.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Stoneskin

Unholy Blight.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The damage dealt to good outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage dealt to other good creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures within the area are sickened increases to 2d4 rounds. On a successful save, a good creature is slowed for 1 round.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Unholy Blight
Unshakable Chill.MOD		DESC:Mythic: On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any other Fortitude saves the target attempts to resist severe cold as part of the spell's effects. The target also takes a -4 penalty on saves against spells or effects with the cold descriptor. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target gains vulnerability to fire (Bestiary 305).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Unshakable Chill
Vampiric Touch.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8). Your melee touch attack to deliver the spell threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. This expanded threat range doesn't stack with other effects or abilities that increase the threat range. If the damage kills the target, you gain fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the target.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Vampiric Touch
Vomit Twin.MOD			DESC:Mythic: Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium, or long can originate from the twin instead of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your tier, and has hit points equal to double your caster level. The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast mythic vomit twin. If the twin's weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon's die type. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Vomit Twin
Walk through Space.MOD		DESC:Mythic: You can teleport as either a move action or a swift action, but never more than once per round. If you expend a move action and a swift action, you may teleport up to 60 feet.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Walk Through Space
Wall of Fire.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet, 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet, and 2d8 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. Any creature that passes through the wall or is within 5 feet of the wall when it's created must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you may move the wall 5 feet in any direction as a move action on your turn. Moving the wall into a fireproof barrier (such as a stone wall) destroys the part of the wall that overlaps the barrier.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Fire
Wall of Force.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall's hardness increases to 40, and its hit points increase to 30 per caster level. A nonmythic disintegrate spell or rod of cancellation negates a 10-footsquare section of a mythic wall of force for 1 round, after which the wall reforms at full strength. One side of the wall (chosen by you) repels creatures within 5 feet as a repulsion spell (using the DC wall of force would have if it allowed a saving throw).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Force
Wall of Ice.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall's hit points increase to 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Add your tier to the Strength check DC to break through the wall. The damage dealt to those that step through the wall increases to 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level. Any creature that passes through the wall must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds; this is a cold effect. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you cover the wall in sharp, protruding icicles. Any creature that touches, strikes, or breaks through the wall takes 1d6 points of cold damage, 1d6 points of piercing damage, and 1 point of bleed damage.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Ice
Wall of Iron.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. If you create an unattached wall, you can weight it so there is a 75%% chance it falls on its own in the direction you want. Subtract 5 from the DC to push it in the direction you want, and add 5 to the DC to push the wall in the other direction. Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, one side of the wall (your choice) has a powerful magnetic charge that attracts metal within 10 feet. The wall automatically attempts a combat maneuver check to pull once per round against any creature that comes in range wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or otherwise carrying a significant amount of metal. The wall's CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier. If the combat maneuver succeeds, the creature is pulled 5 feet closer to the wall. The wall gains a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check if the creature is within 5 feet. If the wall succeeds at its check against a creature within 5 feet, the creature is pulled up against the wall and is treated as grappled. Dropping metal items or removing metal armor allows a creature to free itself from the wall. The magnetic charge fades after 1 hour per tier. Wrenching an item away from the wall requires a successful Strength check (DC 10 + the wall's CMB).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Iron
Wall of Stone.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. The wall's hardness increases to 12. Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall is impassable to ethereal travel and spells such as passwall and phase door. The wall is immune to non-mythic disintegrate, shatter, sympathetic vibration, and other nonmythic magical effects that specifically affect stone (including earthquake, soften earth and stone, and transmute rock to mud).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Stone
Wall of Thorns.MOD		DESC:Mythic: The damage dealt increases to 30 minus the creature's AC. Any creature adjacent to the wall is automatically grappled by it. Any creature that begins its turn grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of damage. Half of this damage is bludgeoning, and the other half is piercing. For the purpose of escaping this grapple, the wall's CMD is 10 + your caster level + your tier. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall automatically grapples creatures other than you within 10 feet. Any creature grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of bleed damage. If a creature doesn't escape the wall's grapple, on its next turn the wall automatically pins it.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wall of Thorns
Web.MOD				DESC:Mythic: The webs are filled with spider swarms (one spider swarm for each 10-foot-by-10-foot area covered in webs). Any creature caught in or moving through the webs is attacked by a spider swarm (or multiple swarms, if it passes through the space of more than one swarm). The spiders don't leave the area of webbing. Destroying the web in an area destroys the swarm there as well, and completely destroying the web destroys all the swarms. Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the webs increase to a 50-foot-radius spread. Webs span any gaps between available anchor points in the area, possibly creating multiple non-contiguous webbed areas. Non-mythic abilities that make creatures immune to webs (such as freedom of movement) instead give them a +5 bonus on saves, combat maneuver checks, and Escape Artist checks against mythic web.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Web
Whirlwind.MOD			DESC:Mythic: The cyclone becomes 15 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top, and 40 feet tall. The cyclone's effect on Large or smaller creatures also applies to Huge creatures, and its damage increases to 3d8 points of damage. The effect on Medium or smaller creatures also applies to Large creatures, and the damage it deals each turn increases to 2d6 points of damage. Augmented (8th): If you expend three uses of mythic power, the cyclone's size increases to 50 feet wide at the base, 150 feet wide at the top, and 150 feet tall. Creatures and objects of all sizes touched by the whirlwind take 8d8 points of damage (Reflex negates), and the damage dealt to those trapped in the cyclone increases to 6d6 points of damage per round. Additionally, unattended objects smaller than 30 feet to a side are swept up in the effect. The area within 20 feet of the whirlwind is treated as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439), and within 40 feet it is treated as strong wind.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Whirlwind
Wish.MOD				DESC:Mythic: When using mythic wish to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power to duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell. You can also produce any one of the following effects that modify or replace effects listed in the non-mythic wish spell description: * If you use mythic wish to remove injuries and afflictions, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power to remove that number of additional afflictions from all affected creatures. * If you use mythic wish to revive the dead, you can expend a second use of mythic power to negate the target's permanent negative level from the resurrection. * Alter fate. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can cast mythic wish as an immediate action before a 1d20 roll is attempted and choose what number you want to come up on the die. Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled mythic wish, even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Wish
Word of Chaos.MOD			DESC:Mythic: When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Non-chaotic creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Mythic Spell,Word of Chaos

The creatures immediately gain the benefits of their chosen paths. Divide the duration evenly among all targets. The targets retain their mythic tier only while they're within 100 feet of the spell's focus component. A target that goes outside this range loses its mythic tier, but instantly regains it if it moves into range again. If the focus component is destroyed while the spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.

Bleed Glory			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Necromancy		DESCRIPTOR:Curse	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:one mythic creature				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:The mythic power cost for all path abilities, feats, spells, and other effects used by the target increases by 1.
Deathless			CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Necromancy					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:living creature touched				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) round		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:The target's soul is strongly anchored to its body, preventing death from hit point damage. No matter how low the target's hit points get, it remains alive (though not necessarily conscious). This spell doesn't prevent death from sources other than hit point damage-such as Constitution damage or drain, death effects, or energy drain. Spells that cure hit points affect the creature normally.
Lend Path			CLASSES:Bard,Magus=4|Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:creature touched					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You temporarily transfer one of your mythic path abilities to another creature, which can use it as if it were part of the creature's own path. If the target is unable to expend mythic power, it can't activate any part of the ability that requires expending uses of mythic power, but the ability otherwise functions as if the creature were 1st tier. While your path ability is transferred in this way, you can't use it yourself (even if it's an automatic ability or one that doesn't require expending uses of mythic power).
Mythic Severance		CLASSES:Inquisitor=3|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Necromancy		DESCRIPTOR:Curse	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:one creature						DURATION:Permanent				SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You restrict the target's access to its mythic power. Each time the target attempts to cast a mythic spell, expend mythic power to activate a path ability, or use any other effect that requires expending uses of mythic power, it must attempt a Will saving throw against the DC of this spell. If it fails this saving throw, the creature loses its action and the ability it was attempting to use has no effect. This spell has no effect on mythic abilities that don't require the target to expend mythic power.
Restore Mythic Power	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:you and one mythic creature			DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:By laying your hands on the target, you're able to transfer some of your mythic essence to the target. You expend three uses of your mythic power to restore one use of the target's mythic power.
Share Glory			CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3		SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL/3) non-mythic creature		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You imbue the targets with a fraction of your mythic nature. They count as mythic creatures for the purpose of path abilities, spells, and other effects that function differently for mythic creatures. This doesn't grant the targets mythic tiers or any uses of mythic power; it merely gives them a greater advantage when others use abilities that work differently for mythic creatures. You must be at least a 1st-tier mythic character to cast this spell.
Steal Power			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5				SCHOOL:Necromancy					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:one mythic creature				DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You sap the power from a mythic creature, using it to restore your own. The target loses 1d4 uses of mythic power. If you have the ability to expend mythic power, you regain one use for each use the target loses.
Terraform			CLASSES:Druid=6|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7			SCHOOL:Transmutation				COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:100 feet	TARGETAREA:100-foot-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*1) days (see text)	SAVEINFO:none					SPELLRES:no			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment. You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change. Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts. If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.
