All creatures adjacent to an aboleth must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 3 hours. Renewed contact with an aboleth's mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.
Mucus Mist				KEY:Mythic Aboleth ~ Mucus Mist				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Aboleth Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:When exposed to the air, a mythic aboleth can release its mucus as a fine mist. This obscures vision like obscuring mist and has the same properties as its mucus cloud. Creatures that breathe water are able to breathe normally while within the cloud. The mist moves with the aboleth.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.
Slime					KEY:Mythic Aboleth ~ Slime					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Aboleth Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:A creature hit by an aboleth's tentacle must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the transformation persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.
Slime Armor				KEY:Mythic Aboleth ~ Slime Armor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Aboleth Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:A mythic aboleth can spend 1 minute to create an armorlike carapace from hardened slime.

# Mythic Cockatrice
Petrification			KEY:Mythic Cockatrice ~ Petrification			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Cockatrice Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:A mythic cockatrice's bite causes flesh to calcify and harden-multiple bites can cause a living creature to fossilize into stone. Each time a creature is damaged by a mythic cockatrice's bite attack, it must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and harden. If a creature's Dexterity score is reduced to 0 by a cockatrice's bite, that creature immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, the victim recovers from the petrification with a Dexterity score of 1 (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal). If a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has any Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources.

Poison				KEY:Mythic Wyvern ~ Poison					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Wyvern Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:Sting-injury; save DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.
Power Lift				KEY:Mythic Wyvern ~ Power Lift				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Wyvern Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A mythic wyvern can expend one use of mythic power to withdraw as a move action (instead of a full-round action), moving up to its speed instead of double. It can even move straight up. If it's grappling a creature, the wyvern can bring the grappled creature with it. Usually a wyvern uses this ability to carry off its prey and drop it from above onto a hard surface. Since this is a move action, the wyvern can damage its target, withdraw, and drop its target all in the same round.

###Block: New Universal Monster Rules
# Ability Name			Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																			Source, Long Desc.		Source, Short Desc.	Source Page
Block Attacks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Once per round, when the creature is hit by a melee or ranged attack, it can attempt a melee attack using its highest attack bonus. If this result exceeds the result from the attack against it, the creature is unaffected by the attack (as if the attack had missed).																																																																																																																							SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.226
Dragon Blood			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The mythic dragon's blood and other fluids are infused with acid, cold, electricity, or fire, matching the dragon's breath weapon energy type. Every time the dragon is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes energy damage according to Table 6-6: Dragon Blood Damage (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the dragon has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.																																																																															SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.226
Dragon Cantrips			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:If the mythic dragon is able to cast arcane spells, it automatically knows all cantrips for its equivalent spellcasting class and can cast them at will.																																																																																																																																										SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Dragon Fury				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:If a mythic dragon confirms a critical hit with a natural weapon, it adds its dragon blood damage to the damage dealt by the natural attack.																																																																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Dual Initiative			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The monster gets two turns each round, one on its initiative count and another on its initiative count - 20. For example, if the monster's initiative is 23, for its first turn it could make a full attack (and take a 5 foot step) at initiative 23, and for its second turn at initiative 3 it could take a move action and cast a spell. This allows the monster to perform two actions per round that normally take an entire round, such as using a summon monster spell. For the purposes of spells and effects that have a duration of a round or longer or trigger at the beginning of the creature's round or the start of its turn such as saving throws against ongoing effects or taking bleed damage, only the monster's first turn each round counts toward such durations.																																					SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Feral Savagery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Under the circumstances listed in the monster's stat block-such as when it makes a full attack or a rend attack-it can immediately attempt an additional attack against an opponent. This attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. This additional attack doesn't stack with similar means of gaining additional attacks, such as the haste spell or a speed weapon. This ability doesn't grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.																																																																						SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Fortification			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The monster has an 50%% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack as a normal hit, as if wearing moderate fortification armor.																																																																																																																																													SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Greensight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The monster can see through thick plant matter as though it were transparent, usually with a range of 60 feet. Leaves, vines, greenery, and undergrowth offer no concealment to the monster's sight, though solid wood still blocks its line of sight.																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Lingering Breath			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The creature can expend one use of mythic power as a free action when it uses its breath weapon to make the area radiate energy damage (of the same type as the breath weapon) for 1 round per mythic rank. Any creature in, entering, or passing through the breath weapon's area during this duration takes damage according to the creature's size. This ability has no effect on breath weapons that do not deal energy damage.																																																																																														SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Mistsight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The monster can see through fog, mist, and murky water as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.																																																																																																																																							SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Mythic Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Up to three times per day, when the creature casts a spell, it can cast the mythic version instead (as with all mythic spells, the creature must expend mythic power to cast a mythic spell in this way).																																																																																																																																		SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Mythic Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The mythic monster can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. Each day, it can expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to its mythic rank. This amount is its maximum amount of mythic power. If an ability allows it to regain mythic power, it can never gain more than this amount. The monster automatically has the surge ability (see page 228), and can use this mythic power to activate it. It may have other abilities that rely on mythic power.																																																																																			SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Poisonous Blood			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Any creature that confirms a critical hit against the monster with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed with poison. (Melee weapons with reach don't endanger their users in this way.) The type of poison depends on the monster. Unless otherwise stated, this poison uses the poison's normal DC, though some monsters might have a poison DC that's Constitution-based.																																																																																																					SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Powerful Blows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The specified attack adds 1-1/2 times the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls instead of its normal Strength bonus or half its Strength bonus.																																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Powerful Blows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The specified attack adds 1-1/2 times the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls instead of its normal Strength bonus or half its Strength bonus.																																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Second Save				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Whenever the creature fails a saving throw against an effect with a duration greater than 1 round, it can keep trying to shake off the effect. At the start of its turn, if it's still affected, it can attempt the save one more time as a free action. If this save succeeds, the effect affects the creature as if it had succeeded at its initial saving throw. If the effect already allows another saving throw on a later turn to break the effect (such as for hold monster), this ability is in addition to the extra saving throw from the effect.																																																																										SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Simple Arcane Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses the higher of its Intelligence or Charisma modifiers to determine its spell DCs.																																																																																SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Simple Divine Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the cleric or druid spell list. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses its Wisdom or Charisma (whichever is higher) to determine its spell DCs.																																																																																	SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Smother				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If the creature's grappled opponent is holding its breath, the monster can force that opponent to expel or consume some of its breath, or can otherwise reduce the time remaining until the target has to attempt checks to avoid suffocation (Core Rulebook 445). If the monster succeeds at a grapple check against the opponent, the remaining duration for which the opponent can hold its breath decreases by 1d6 rounds. If this reduces the remaining time that the creature can hold its breath to 0 rounds or fewer, the DCs of its suffocation checks increase by 5. For example, if the monster is grappling a creature that has 10 rounds remaining before it has to attempt suffocation checks, a successful grapple check reduces that duration by 1d6 rounds. If the monster has another ability (such as constrict) that harms the opponent when it succeeds at a grapple check, it can automatically use the smother ability when it succeeds at the grapple check to use the other ability.	SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Steal					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The creature can attempt a steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) against its opponent as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity if it hits with the specified attack.																																																																																																																																	SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Surge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The monster can call upon its mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. It can expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll it just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the original roll is made and the results are revealed. The bonus die gained by using this ability increases to 1d8 at 4th rank, 1d10 at 7th rank, and 1d12 at 10th rank. The monster can use this ability even if it's mindless or of animal-level intelligence.																																																																															SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
X-Ray Vision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The monster can see through solid matter as if wearing a ring of x-ray vision. This is as exhausting as if the monster were actually using the ring.																																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
