Bastion of the Inheritor.MOD										EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Shield.Special Ability ~ Rallying ~ Armor																													SOURCEPAGE:p.142									SPROP:reduces the extra damage she takes from anarchic weapons, smite good, smite law, and unholy weapons by her tier, to a minimum of 0. When its wearer uses the smite evil class feature, she can expend one use of mythic power to extend the deflection bonus to AC she gains against her target to all allies in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on her. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until the smite evil ends, whichever comes first.
Spiritwalk Armor.MOD											EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Armor.Special Ability ~ Shadow / Improved ~ Armor																											SOURCEPAGE:p.142									SPROP:It grants its wearer the ability to use vanishAPG as a quickened spell-like ability five times per day. If a mythic wearer uses the vanish ability, he can expend one use of mythic power to also make himself incorporeal for 1 round.
Stalwart Breastplate.MOD					WT:40		ACCHECK:-5		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Fortification / Light ~ Armor.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Armor																											SOURCEPAGE:p.143				BONUS:VAR|ArmorCheckPenalty|1	SPROP:immediate action, the wearer can negate the effects of a successful combat maneuver made to bull rush, overrun, or trip her. As a swift action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain immunity to ability damage, ability drain, critical hits, and sneak attacks. This effect lasts for 1 round per mythic tier the wearer possesses.

# Weapons
Bow of Erastil.MOD			NAMEISPI:YES						EQMOD:Special Quality ~ Composite Bow Strength Rating|6.Special Ability ~ Distance ~ Ranged.Special Ability ~ Endless Ammunition ~ Ranged.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon													SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SOURCEPAGE:p.143						SPROP:By expending one use of mythic power, the bow's wielder can make a single attack and compare the result against every enemy within 60 feet of her. The wielder rolls damage only once, and applies it to all foes hit by the attack. If the attack is a critical threat, the wielder chooses only one enemy hit and attempts to confirm the critical against that enemy.
Brutal Axe.MOD												EQMOD:Material ~ Adamantine ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon																													SOURCEPAGE:p.144									SPROP:While wielding this axe, a creature is considered to have the Improved Sunder feat. It also deals an additional 1d12 points of damage when used to sunder. If the wielder already has Improved Sunder, the axe grants Greater Sunder; and if the wielder already has Greater Sunder, it instead provides a further +2 bonus on sunder combat maneuver checks. As an immediate action after making a successful attack with the axe, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to make a combat maneuver check to sunder a single item being used by the creature he just successfully attacked. This sunder attempt deals double damage and uses the wielder's full base attack bonus. If the item is destroyed by this sunder attempt, no excess damage is applied to the item's wielder or other items.
Chaos Hammer.MOD												EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Anarchic ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon																													SOURCEPAGE:p.144									SPROP:can strike the ground to create the effects of the chaos hammer spell (Will DC 16, CL 9th) that bursts out from the warhammer's wielder. A mythic creature wielding this weapon can expend one use of mythic power to activate this ability without using up its daily use.
Dagger of a Thousand Bites.MOD									EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Keen ~ Weapon.Material ~ Mithril ~ Weapon / Item.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Returning ~ Thrown																	SOURCEPAGE:p.144									SPROP:wielder can expend one use of mythic power when throwing the dagger. When the dagger is thrown in this fashion and hits its target, it can be directed to strike a different target within 30 feet of the first. The new target must still be within the attacker's line of sight. This additional attack is made using the same attack bonus as the first, though range penalties apply based on the total distance the dagger flies. The dagger's wielder can continue selecting additional targets within his line of sight until the dagger misses, though no creature can be targeted by the dagger more than once in the same round.
Dragonbreath Bow.MOD											EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Flaming Burst ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon																												SOURCEPAGE:p.144									SPROP:A mythic wielder can expend one use of mythic power when drawing back the bow to create an arrow of pure flame. This flame arrow acts as a ranged touch attack that can target only creatures within the first range increment of the bow. When it hits its target, this flame arrow deals 3d10+2 points of fire damage. This damage stacks with the bow's flaming burst special ability.
Fire Goddess's Blade.MOD										EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Flaming ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon																													SOURCEPAGE:p.144									SPROP:Three times per day as a swift action, its wielder can transform the sword into a blade of pure flame. In this form, the blade deals 1d8+9 points of fire damage (as the flame blade spell). Once per day, the sword's wielder can expend one use of mythic power to transform the blade into a Large fire elemental for 10 minutes. When the duration ends or the fire elemental is defeated, the blade reappears in its owner's hands.
Gun with no Name.MOD											EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Lucky / Greater ~ Firearm.Special Ability ~ Mythic Bane ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon																					SOURCEPAGE:p.145									SPROP:This weapon can be reloaded normally, but if its wielder expends either one use of mythic power or 1 grit point as a swift action, each of the firearm's empty barrels magically reloads with either black powder and a bullet or with a flare alchemical cartridge (the wielder chooses, and she can mix and match the ammunition type with each barrel). While carrying this firearm, the wielder is immune to scrying and any form of divination that attempts to ascertain her location, thoughts, or alignment. The firearm itself is immune to locate object and similar effects.
Pick of Stonecleaving.MOD										EQMOD:Material ~ Adamantine ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon																													SOURCEPAGE:p.145									SPROP:deals an additional 2d6 points of damage to unattended objects. If the wielder expends one use of mythic power when making such an attack, the pick bypasses the object's hardness and deals 4d6 additional damage instead of 2d6.
# Need to implement change for Paladin or LG Mythic
Sacred Avenger.MOD											EQMOD:Material ~ Cold Iron.Special Ability ~ +3 ~ Weapon																															SOURCEPAGE:p.145									SPROP:This +3 cold iron longsword becomes a +5 holy defiantUE cold iron longsword in the hands of a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature. If the creature wielding this weapon is a paladin with mythic tiers, she can also grant the weapon the brilliant energy special ability on command. Dismissing the brilliant energy ability is a free action. When wielded by a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature, this weapon provides spell resistance equal to 5 + the character's paladin class level (if any) + the character's mythic tier (if any) to the wielder and anyone within 10 feet of her. It also enables the wielder to use mythic greater dispel magic once per round as a standard action, with a caster level equal to either the wielder's paladin class level or double her mythic tier, whichever is higher. Mythic greater dispel magic functions as greater dispel magic including the benefits of the mythic dispel magic spell, but when the wielder dispels a spell, she heals 1d6 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell instead of healing 1d4 points of damage.
Shadow Spike.MOD												EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Cruel ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon																	ALTEQMOD:Special Ability ~ Cruel ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon	SOURCEPAGE:p.145									SPROP:As a standard action, the wielder can drive the spike into the ground on either the Material Plane or the Shadow Plane, creating a rift merging those two planes. This rift is 30 feet in diameter, lasts for 1 minute, and can be created once per day. If the creature that drives the shadow spike into the ground expends one use of mythic power when doing so, the effect lasts until the shadow spike is pulled out of the ground (which takes a standard action). The rift's area acts as the deeper darkness spell. Spells with the darkness or shadow descriptors cast within the rift have +1 caster level, and are affected as if cast with the Extend Spell feat. As a standard action, any mythic creature within the area can expend three uses of mythic power to plane shift to the Shadow Plane (if on the Material Plane) or to the Material Plane (if on the Shadow Plane). If a mythic creature plane shifts while holding the shadow spike, the weapon teleports with that creature, ending the effect.
Shadow's Touch.MOD											EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Keen ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon																													SOURCEPAGE:p.145									SPROP:It ignores bonuses to AC provided by deflection and force effects, and deals 2 points of Strength damage on a confirmed critical hit. By expending one use of mythic power while attacking, the wielder can strike a force effect and disintegrate it as a touch attack. This effect also automatically dispels force effects that can be dispelled whether or not they're subject to disintegrate. As a standard action, the wielder can expend a use of mythic power while slashing at the air to open up a rift to the Shadow Plane. This functions as shadow walk, except that a maximum number of creatures equal to double the wielder's tier can pass through before the rift closes.
Skirmishing Spear.MOD											EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Returning ~ Thrown																												SOURCEPAGE:p.146									SPROP:When thrown, this +1 returning spear is considered a one-handed weapon and gains a +2 bonus on the attack roll. If the spear hits when thrown, the wielder can, as an immediate action, expend one use of mythic power to teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to the creature struck. This effect is treated as dimension door, except the wielder can act after teleporting. The spear comes back to its wielder's hand when he appears. If he hadn't taken a move action prior to throwing the spear, he can continue a full attack with the spear.
Spellbreaker.MOD												EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Bane ~ Weapon|Spellcaster Bane.Special Ability ~ +3 ~ Weapon																										SOURCEPAGE:p.146									SPROP:The enhanced end acts as a bane weapon against any creature with the ability to cast spells or use spelllike abilities. As a standard action, the wielder can strike the unenhanced end against the ground while expending one use of mythic power to produce an antimagic field centered on the staff. This effect has a duration of 2 hours. Anyone striking the staff against the ground a second time dismisses the effect. The antimagic field remains in effect if the staff is dropped or disarmed. The staff retains its enhancement bonus and extra damage against spellcasters inside any antimagic field.
Stormcaller.MOD												EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Keen ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Shock ~ Weapon																								SOURCEPAGE:p.146									SPROP:The enhanced end acts as a bane weapon against any creature with the ability to cast spells or use spelllike abilities. As a standard action, the wielder can strike the unenhanced end against the ground while expending one use of mythic power to produce an antimagic field centered on the staff. This effect has a duration of 2 hours. Anyone striking the staff against the ground a second time dismisses the effect. The antimagic field remains in effect if the staff is dropped or disarmed. The staff retains its enhancement bonus and extra damage against spellcasters inside any antimagic field.
Sword of Inner Fire.MOD											EQMOD:Special Ability ~ Brilliant Energy ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Flaming Burst ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon																				SOURCEPAGE:p.146									SPROP:In the hands of a mythic wielder, the sword's fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. As a swift action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to enable the sword of inner fire to damage nonliving creatures (such as constructs and undead) for 1 round, though the sword still can't damage inanimate objects. A wielder of at least 3rd tier can absorb the sword of inner fire into her body as a swift action, and call it back to hand with another swift action. While the sword is stored in this way, her eyes burn with orange flame and she gains a +5 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws.
