Mage Strike			KEY:Mythic Path Feature ~ Mage Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialAttack	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Archmage									DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one melee attack. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round.

The normal damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction, but the energy damage is still affected by resistances and immunities.
Rally				KEY:Mythic Path Feature ~ Rally			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathFeature.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Marshal										DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to rally your allies.

Attempt a disarm combat maneuver check using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier, and add your tier to the roll. Using this ability doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If your attack is successful, your target drops one item of your choice that it is carrying, even if the item is wielded with two hands. If your attack exceeds the CMD of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). Unlike with a melee disarm, failing the attack by 10 or more doesn't make you drop your weapon, and you can't automatically pick up the item dropped.

If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.

You must be using a shield in order to use this ability. Subtract your shield's hardness and hit points from the damage of the attack and apply the remaining damage to your hit points. If the shield takes enough damage to destroy it, it's destroyed. Otherwise, it gains the broken condition, even if the damage was not enough to give it the broken condition under other circumstances. You can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to negate any damage dealt to the shield, though you still take any damage that exceeds its hardness and hit points. You can choose to negate the damage after the damage is rolled.

Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specific animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph). This specific creature must be known to you, but it doesn't have to be known by the target. The target gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as that individual, but Bluff checks or knowledge of the individual might be required to make the disguise truly convincing.

Using this ability is a standard action that requires you to attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against your foe. If the check is successful, reduce the target's armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus (your choice) by half your tier (minimum 1). If the creature has an enhancement bonus to the bonus you chose, reduce the normal bonus first, then apply any leftover reduction to the enhancement bonus. You can't reduce the bonus below 0. Armor and shields damaged in this way can be repaired as if they had the broken condition. Natural armor regains the lost bonus at the rate of 1 point per day.

You can attempt a skill check with a class skill in place of a skill that uses the same ability score modifier. For example, you could attempt an Acrobatics check in place of a Stealth check because both skills are based on Dexterity. You take a -5 penalty on this check and can't take 10 or 20 on it.

You must be aware of the construct, spell, or trap's existence, though not necessarily its specific parameters, for this ability to function. For instance, you can't bypass a trap you haven't noticed. You can fool a mindless construct if it was programmed to allow certain creatures to enter its area without provoking a response, but not if it was ordered to prevent anyone from entering with no exceptions. If you expend one use of mythic power for each effect, you can bring with you a number of allies equal to your tier. They must remain within 10 feet of you until out of range of the bypassed effect.

By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to transfer an active magical effect from a target creature to you. If you succeed, the highest-level effect on the target transfers to you (determine randomly if the target has multiple effects with the same level), ending the effect for the target and continuing it on you with the remaining duration as if you were the original target. You may end the effect on yourself as a standard action; this doesn't cause it to revert to the original target.

If you expend one use of mythic power when altering a trap in this way, you can move the trap to any point within 100 feet that is in line of sight.
Treacherous Critical		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Treacherous Critical			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,1																																						DESC:When you score a critical threat, you can attempt a free combat maneuver check instead of dealing extra damage. If you do, attempt your confirmation roll as normal and add your tier to the result.

For a throw, you can throw the target of your grapple up to 10 feet per tier; if the creature strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of the remaining throwing distance and lands prone. For a crush, you deal 1d6 points of non-lethal damage per tier. For a swing, you can use the target as a weapon against another creature, treating the grappled creature as a two-handed weapon.

You can continue to apply excess healing to other adjacent allies until no injured allies are adjacent or you run out of excess healing. For example, if you could cure 40 points of damage with your cure critical wounds spell and the target has taken only 20 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 20 points of healing to an adjacent ally; if that second ally has taken only 15 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 5 points of healing to another adjacent ally.

This ability doesn't function if the creature is magically disguised or has been polymorphed into a different shape. You can automatically detect the alignment of any creature you see casting a divine spell; if that creature worships a deity, you also learn its deity. Spells and effects that mask a creature's alignment prevent the use of this ability. Whenever you cast a spell that affects creatures differently based on their alignment(such as holy smite), you may have the spell treat creatures of one particular alignment as an alignment one step away from that alignment. For example, when casting holy smite, you could treat all lawful neutral creatures as lawful good or lawful evil, all chaotic neutral creature as chaotic good or chaotic evil, or all neutral creatures as neutral good or neutral evil.

For example, a 12th-level fighter normally has a base attack bonus of +12/+7/+2; with this ability, his base attack bonus is +12/+12/+7. This ability doesn't reduce the penalties from two-weapon fighting or other situational penalties on attack rolls (such as Combat Expertise, Power Attack, fighting defensively, or harmful conditions). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the attack bonus on additional attacks increases by another 5.

You can have this ability in effect on only one elixir, extract, or potion at a time. Using it on a second one causes the duration of the first to revert to normal-and to end immediately if the normal duration would have expired. If you're at least 9th tier, you can select this ability a second time to have it work on extracts and potions with a duration of 1 minute or longer.
Farwalker				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Farwalker					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																								PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6											PREVARLT:Farwalker,2						DEFINE:Farwalker|0															DESC:The boundaries of the Material Plane mean little to you.

Fight On				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Fight On					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Marshal																																											PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:With an order or a determined look, you spur a wounded ally to keep fighting. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow a creature other than yourself that is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points to remain conscious and alive. The creature can't die from hit point damage until after the start of your next turn. You can extend this effect for 1 round at the start of your next turn by expending another use of mythic power as a free action. Though the creature can't be killed by hit point damage, any damage it takes still applies to its current hit points. When this ability's effect ends, the creature falls unconscious or dies if its current hit points or other circumstances would otherwise cause it to do so. The creature must be within 30 feet for you to start or extend this effect.
Fistful of Daggers		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Fistful of Daggers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Champion																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:When you could make a full attack with thrown weapons, you can instead make a single attack roll at your highest attack bonus and apply the result to any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone. Roll damage once and deal it to all creatures hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. You must throw one weapon at each target. Use the bonuses to attack and damage from the least powerful weapon thrown (for example, if you have one +2 dagger and 20 masterwork daggers, the attacks are treated as masterwork daggers). Apply any effects of concealment for individual targets as normal. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.
Indomitable				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Indomitable				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Guardian																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:Select one of the following conditions: bleed, blinded, confused, dazed, deafened, entangled, fatigued, frightened, shaken,sickened, or staggered.

Inspiring Assault			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Inspiring Assault			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Marshal																																											PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire your allies to greatness in combat. Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn. This ability doesn't stack with haste or similar effects. An ally must be within 30 feet of you at the start of its turn to benefit from this ability.
Invincible Stand			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Invincible Stand			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Guardian																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to make yourself nearly invincible for a short period of time. You gain DR 20/- for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If you choose to move or are moved by another creature during this time, this protection immediately ends.
Mythic Presence			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Mythic Presence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																							PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																				DEFINE:MythicPresenceDC|0														DESC:Your power unnerves ordinary mortals. By expending one use of mythic power, you gain an effect similar to frightful presence, except that creatures are affected according to their tier (or rank, in the case of monsters) instead of their Hit Dice. Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they fail. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank higher than yours are unaffected by your mythic presence. The Will save against your mythic presence equals %1 [10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier]. This ability lasts for 1 minute and has a range of 30 feet.|MythicPresenceDC																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					BONUS:VAR|MythicPresenceDC|10+CHA+MythicLevel
Mythic Resolve			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Mythic Resolve				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Guardian																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You're imbued with power and grace that protects you. Whenever you attempt a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll again. You can use this ability more than once and take the highest result of all the rolls. You can use this ability only after the initial roll is made, but before the results are revealed. Using this ability doesn't require an action, and it can be used as long as you are conscious.
Mythic Sight			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Mythic Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																								PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6											PREVARLT:Mythic_Sight,2						DEFINE:MythicSightLVL|0	DEFINE:Mythic_Sight|0											DESC:When you take this ability, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet.

For example, bestow curse has no effect on you, and you can handle, carry, or discard a cursed magic item without harm. If a cursed item has useful functions and a cursed effect (such as armor of arrow attraction) or drawback (such as a mace of blood), you are immune to the cursed effect and drawback, and can still use its other abilities. If a cursed item works normally for a period of time before its curse triggers (such as gauntlets of fumbling), the item stops working for you when the curse would normally trigger. If you're an oracle, you can ignore the negative effects of your oracle's curse.																																																																																																																																															ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Immunity to Curses
Perfect Strike			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Perfect Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Champion																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to deliver a perfect strike. A perfect strike attack is made using your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals double the normal amount of damage, and this damage bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If the perfect strike is a critical hit, increase the critical multiplier for the attack by 1 (so a x2 weapon deals x3 damage). Damage that isn't multiplied on a critical hit isn't multiplied on a perfect strike. Perfect strike can be used in conjunction with any champion's strike if you expend uses of mythic power for each ability separately.
Precision Critical		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Precision Critical			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:Whenever you score a critical hit, double any extra precision damage dice, such as sneak attack damage. These dice are only doubled, not multiplied by the weapon's critical modifier.
Slayer's Cyclone			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Slayer's Cyclone			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:When you spot a breach in an enemy's defenses, you make attacks with a lethal blend of speed and precision. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus. If you hit and the target is flat-footed, deal damage as normal. You can then move and make another attack. You may continue this process until you miss, attack an opponent that isn't flat-footed, or attack an opponent you already hit this round. You can't move more than double your speed in this way in 1 round.
Sanctum				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Sanctum					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Archmage																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You gain access to your own personal extradimensional sanctum. By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, you conjure the door to your own personal sanctum, similar to mage's magnificent mansion, but with the following differences. The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it-a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door. As a full-round action, your familiar can enter or leave the sanctum from any square adjacent to you, without using the conjured door.
Servant of Balance		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Servant of Balance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Hierophant																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:Whenever a critical hit is confirmed against you, the attack deals normal damage instead of critical damage. Other effects that trigger on a successful critical hit (such as the Blinding Critical feat, the fire damage from a critical hit with a flaming burst weapon, or the effects of a vorpal weapon) all affect you normally.
Shatter Spells			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Shatter Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Champion																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.
Steal Power				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Steal Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:By attempting a melee touch attack as a standard action, you can try to steal mythic power from another creature. The target must have at least one use of mythic power available. If the attack hits, attempt an opposed d20 roll against the target, adding your tier. If your total exceeds that of the target, the target loses one use of mythic power and you gain one use. You can use this ability on a given creature only once per day.
Surge of Inspiration		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Surge of Inspiration			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Marshal																																											PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:Your very presence pushes those around you to be their very best. As an immediate action, when an ally within line of sight misses with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability to grant the ally the benefits of your surge ability on that attack roll or saving throw. The ally uses your surge die, and can apply the bonus after the result is revealed, possibly turning a failure into a success.
Sweeping Strike			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Sweeping Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Champion																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:Even when you're swarmed, your foes are not safe from danger. Whenever you could make a full attack, you may instead make a single attack at your highest attack bonus and apply the results to all opponents within your reach. Roll damage once and apply it to all opponents hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.
Take the Hit			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Take the Hit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Guardian																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You are a living shield for your allies. Whenever an adjacent ally takes damage from a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can split the damage. You take half of the damage (rounded down), and your ally takes the remaining amount. This damage is not subject to any resistances or damage reduction you might have, but any such defenses the target of the attack possesses apply before the damage is split. You don't suffer any other effects from the attack (such as disease, grab, or poison).
Tongues				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Tongues					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																								PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You can understand and speak any language, as the tongues spell. If this ability is dispelled, you can resume it as a free action.
Unending Performance		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Unending Performance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You can imbue an ally with power that lingers for a full day. Whenever you use a spell, bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, you can designate any one creature affected by this bonus. The designated creature keeps this bonus for up to 24 hours. You can have only one creature designated in this way at a time. If you designate a new creature, the bonus immediately ends for the previous target. The creature you designate must be one of the targets when you cast the spell, start the performance, or use the class feature.
Undying Healer			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Undying Healer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Hierophant																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:Whenever you fall unconscious, a ghostly image of you manifests from out of your body. Even though you're unconscious, you control this image. On your turn each round, this image can fly up to 30 feet and use your ability to lay on hands to heal, channel energy to heal, or cast any conjuration (healing) spell that you could cast. This consumes these abilities as normal. Abilities used by the image can't benefit you. This image lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. This ability can be dispelled, using double your tier as the caster level. If you die or regain consciousness, the image immediately ends.
Unswerving Loyalty		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Unswerving Loyalty			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Marshal																																											PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:You are a bastion of strength and resolve, and you possess the ability to protect your mind from even the most powerful charms and compulsions. You gain immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, though you can choose to be affected by them if you wish. When subject to a mind-affecting effect from a mythic source, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain immunity to that effect.
Words of Valor			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Words of Valor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MythicPathAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Marshal																																											PREVARGTEQ:MythicLevel,6																																						DESC:With a mere speech, you empower your allies to take on any foe. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to inspire all of your allies within a 30-foot radius, granting them the effects of the spell heroism and making them immune to fear for 1 round per tier. Each mythic creature that is affected by this ability can use its surge ability once during this duration without having to expend one use of mythic power.

###Block: New Universal Monster Rules
# Ability Name			Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																			Source, Long Desc.		Source, Short Desc.	Source Page
Block Attacks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Once per round, when the creature is hit by a melee or ranged attack, it can attempt a melee attack using its highest attack bonus. If this result exceeds the result from the attack against it, the creature is unaffected by the attack (as if the attack had missed).																																																																																																																							SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.226
Dragon Blood			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The mythic dragon's blood and other fluids are infused with acid, cold, electricity, or fire, matching the dragon's breath weapon energy type. Every time the dragon is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes energy damage according to Table 6-6: Dragon Blood Damage (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the dragon has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.																																																																															SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.226
Dragon Cantrips			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:If the mythic dragon is able to cast arcane spells, it automatically knows all cantrips for its equivalent spellcasting class and can cast them at will.																																																																																																																																										SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Dragon Fury				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:If a mythic dragon confirms a critical hit with a natural weapon, it adds its dragon blood damage to the damage dealt by the natural attack.																																																																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Dual Initiative			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The monster gets two turns each round, one on its initiative count and another on its initiative count - 20. For example, if the monster's initiative is 23, for its first turn it could make a full attack (and take a 5 foot step) at initiative 23, and for its second turn at initiative 3 it could take a move action and cast a spell. This allows the monster to perform two actions per round that normally take an entire round, such as using a summon monster spell. For the purposes of spells and effects that have a duration of a round or longer or trigger at the beginning of the creature's round or the start of its turn such as saving throws against ongoing effects or taking bleed damage, only the monster's first turn each round counts toward such durations.																																					SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Feral Savagery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Under the circumstances listed in the monster's stat block-such as when it makes a full attack or a rend attack-it can immediately attempt an additional attack against an opponent. This attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. This additional attack doesn't stack with similar means of gaining additional attacks, such as the haste spell or a speed weapon. This ability doesn't grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.																																																																						SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Fortification			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The monster has an 50%% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack as a normal hit, as if wearing moderate fortification armor.																																																																																																																																													SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Greensight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The monster can see through thick plant matter as though it were transparent, usually with a range of 60 feet. Leaves, vines, greenery, and undergrowth offer no concealment to the monster's sight, though solid wood still blocks its line of sight.																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Lingering Breath			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The creature can expend one use of mythic power as a free action when it uses its breath weapon to make the area radiate energy damage (of the same type as the breath weapon) for 1 round per mythic rank. Any creature in, entering, or passing through the breath weapon's area during this duration takes damage according to the creature's size. This ability has no effect on breath weapons that do not deal energy damage.																																																																																														SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Mistsight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The monster can see through fog, mist, and murky water as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.																																																																																																																																							SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Mythic Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Up to three times per day, when the creature casts a spell, it can cast the mythic version instead (as with all mythic spells, the creature must expend mythic power to cast a mythic spell in this way).																																																																																																																																		SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Mythic Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The mythic monster can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. Each day, it can expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to its mythic rank. This amount is its maximum amount of mythic power. If an ability allows it to regain mythic power, it can never gain more than this amount. The monster automatically has the surge ability (see page 228), and can use this mythic power to activate it. It may have other abilities that rely on mythic power.																																																																																			SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Poisonous Blood			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Any creature that confirms a critical hit against the monster with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed with poison. (Melee weapons with reach don't endanger their users in this way.) The type of poison depends on the monster. Unless otherwise stated, this poison uses the poison's normal DC, though some monsters might have a poison DC that's Constitution-based.																																																																																																					SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Powerful Blows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The specified attack adds 1-1/2 times the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls instead of its normal Strength bonus or half its Strength bonus.																																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.227
Powerful Blows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The specified attack adds 1-1/2 times the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls instead of its normal Strength bonus or half its Strength bonus.																																																																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Second Save				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Whenever the creature fails a saving throw against an effect with a duration greater than 1 round, it can keep trying to shake off the effect. At the start of its turn, if it's still affected, it can attempt the save one more time as a free action. If this save succeeds, the effect affects the creature as if it had succeeded at its initial saving throw. If the effect already allows another saving throw on a later turn to break the effect (such as for hold monster), this ability is in addition to the extra saving throw from the effect.																																																																										SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Simple Arcane Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses the higher of its Intelligence or Charisma modifiers to determine its spell DCs.																																																																																SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Simple Divine Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the cleric or druid spell list. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses its Wisdom or Charisma (whichever is higher) to determine its spell DCs.																																																																																	SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Smother				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If the creature's grappled opponent is holding its breath, the monster can force that opponent to expel or consume some of its breath, or can otherwise reduce the time remaining until the target has to attempt checks to avoid suffocation (Core Rulebook 445). If the monster succeeds at a grapple check against the opponent, the remaining duration for which the opponent can hold its breath decreases by 1d6 rounds. If this reduces the remaining time that the creature can hold its breath to 0 rounds or fewer, the DCs of its suffocation checks increase by 5. For example, if the monster is grappling a creature that has 10 rounds remaining before it has to attempt suffocation checks, a successful grapple check reduces that duration by 1d6 rounds. If the monster has another ability (such as constrict) that harms the opponent when it succeeds at a grapple check, it can automatically use the smother ability when it succeeds at the grapple check to use the other ability.	SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Steal					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The creature can attempt a steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) against its opponent as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity if it hits with the specified attack.																																																																																																																																	SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Surge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The monster can call upon its mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. It can expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll it just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the original roll is made and the results are revealed. The bonus die gained by using this ability increases to 1d8 at 4th rank, 1d10 at 7th rank, and 1d12 at 10th rank. The monster can use this ability even if it's mindless or of animal-level intelligence.																																																																															SOURCELONG:Mythic Adventures	SOURCESHORT:MA		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
X-Ray Vision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The monster can see through solid matter as if wearing a ring of x-ray vision. This is as exhausting as if the monster were actually using the ring.
