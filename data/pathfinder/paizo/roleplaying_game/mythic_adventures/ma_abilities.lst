Archmage		KEY:Mythic Path ~ Archmage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:For most practitioners of the arcane arts, learning magic requires a great deal of study and practice. Even for those who draw magic from their blood, the effort can be taxing. Not so for the archmage. This master of the arcane draws power from the very fabric of reality itself, learning to weave magic easily and naturally.&nl;The archmage is the master of arcane magic, and many of the abilities of this path enhance your ability to cast arcane spells or greatly increase their potency. In addition, may of the options in this path increase your knowledge of magic and of those who wield it. At the highest tiers, you can begin to break down the walls between the different types of magic and alter the very fabric of reality itself.&nl;Role: As an archmage, you use your abilities to add a great deal of power to your arcane spells, enabling them to blast through defenses and cripple foes. Your mastery over the arcane arts and your vast knowledge are of great benefit to the rest of your group, and your talent at getting the most out of magic items can prove invaluable. Although you gain little in the way of defenses, your overwhelming offensive capabilities more than make up for it--though you should still avoid being engaged in melee.&nl;Classes: The archmage is the most common path selection for characters capable of casting arcane spells, particularly sorcerers and wizards. Bards, summoners, and witches will find that this path has a great deal to offer, though some other paths might also prove useful to them.

Champion		KEY:Mythic Path ~ Champion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The champion is the pinnacle of skill at arms and armor. No ordinary fighter could hope to match the skill with a blade, a bow, or an axe that surges within a mythic champion. The champion turns aside blows and shatters shields with every movement, all while racing gracefully across the chaotic battlefield. When the screams of fallen foes die down, the champion stands strong and defiant in blood-spattered armor, hefting a weapon and shouting a terrifying war cry.&nl;Role: As a champion, your role is to take the fight to your enemies. Using devastating melee powers, you can crush your enemies before they even have a chance to harm you and your allies. Few can match your skill at arms or your ability to perform amazing feats of strength. The champion abilities allow you to control your foes, move easily around the battlefield, and challenge a large number of foes all at once. The rest of the party can count on you to dominate any melee you charge into.&nl;Classes: While members or nearly any class could be champions, those who focus on melee attacks-- barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, monks, paladins, and rangers--will find the abilities in this path most attractive and useful. However, even magi or rogues could find that the path of the champion is an excellent way to augment their abilities.

Guardian		KEY:Mythic Path ~ Guardian	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Not all mythic characters seek glory and fame for themselves. Some take a more humble route, watching over those dear to them or the lands they call home. Guardians seek connections with those around them, even the beasts, and draw their power from the trust of such bonds. This doesn't mean that all guardians are peaceful--indeed many use violent means to further their goals and safeguard those they watch over. But they find worth in those who travel with them. In battle, none can take the sort of punishment and wounds that a guardian can sustain.&nl;Role: When others would retreat, you stand your ground. Your place is at the front of the battle, taking every hit your enemies can give while daring them to dish out more. Your job is to stop your enemies' advance, interposing yourself in the path of peril. You'll gladly take all that brutal punishment and return the beating with zeal. The wounds you suffer might kill a lesser hero, but you relish the thrill of combat, confident that your physical and mental perfection will lead to victory.&nl;Classes: Any class that is frequently in the middle of a chaotic melee will find many valuable abilities within the guardian path. Barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, inquisitors, monks, and paladins all make excellent guardians. Some of the guardian's powers also lend themselves to the druid, ranger, or even the summoner, granting bonuses to companions and allies.

Hierophant		KEY:Mythic Path ~ Hierophant	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Those who draw upon a god's power find themselves becoming closer to the divine. Some aspire to become immortal servants of their gods, and others reach for apotheosis itself. A hierophant could be either of these, channeling divine power directly or indirectly--whether from a deity, the spirit of nature, or the power of life itself--and eventually becoming more like a patron of divine power than a mere devotee.&nl;Role: As a hierophant, your role in the group is to act as a conduit to the divine, healing and helping your allies through the miracles that you bestow. This focus is just as strong if you are instead a servant of nature, using the powers granted to you by this path to protect the wilderness and bring its fury to those who would dare to defile it.&nl;Classes: Members of any class that draws upon divine magic will find the path of the hierophant useful-- particularly clerics, druids, and oracles. Even classes with limited divine spellcasting, such as the inquisitor and paladin, have a number of useful options in this path.

The marshal is such a leader, renowned for his vision, courage, and strategic acumen. Soldiers f lock to a marshal's banner for a chance to serve under such a commander, confident that his skill will see them through even the most difficult challenges.&nl;Role: As a marshal, your abilities allow you to inspire mythic and non-mythic allies alike to greatness. In a group, you protect and push your allies to even greater acts of heroism. All the while, the powers of the marshal allow you to take the lead, help your companions, and take the fight to your enemies.&nl;Classes: Bards, cavaliers, clerics, inquisitors, and paladins will all find a host of useful abilities in the marshal path. In fact, almost any character who assists others, both during combat and afterward, will likewise find that the path of the marshal includes a number of valuable abilities that will help in her noble endeavors.

Trickster		KEY:Mythic Path ~ Trickster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Seen only when they choose to be seen, tricksters manipulate kings and peasants alike, usually without anyone sensing their inf luence. Characters who rely upon their skills and wit find themselves drawn to the trickster's path. The mythic power of these heroes allows them to perform tasks that most would consider impossible. They can climb any wall, swim any current, and move without being seen by even the most observant guard. When they strike at their foes, they do so with unmatched accuracy.&nl;Role: As a trickster, your role in the party is one of deception and manipulation. You have access to a number of abilities that empower you to confound your foes, both physically and mentally. With a subtle jest or twist of phrase, you can steer entire cities and even nations to do your bidding--but should that fail, you can always rely on a dagger from the shadows.&nl;Classes: Members of any class that relies on skills would make good tricksters, as would those who heavily utilize ranged combat or magical methods of subterfuge. The alchemist, bard, and rogue all have a number of abilities that fit well with the trickster. Gunslingers, monks, and rangers will also find that the trickster has more than a few interesting options.

Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specific animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph). This specific creature must be known to you, but it doesn't have to be known by the target.

You can't copy an ability that has a limited number of uses per day (such as rage, smite evil, or spellcasting) or an ability that involves a companion (such aseidolon, hunter's bond, or nature bond).

If you're healed to full hit points, you come back to life and gain 1 permanent negative level for each minute you were dead (these negative levels can be removed as normal). Until you're healed to full hit points, you don't regain consciousness and are still dead no matter what other abilities you might have. If you aren't brought back to life within a number of minutes equal to your total character level, your death is permanent (although you can still be brought back by spells such as raise dead).

When you are hit by or fail a saving throw against an arcane spell that deals hit point damage, as an immediate action you can choose to take damage as if that spell were affected by the Maximize Spell feat. If the spell's damage can't be increased by the Maximize Spell feat or is already under the effect of the Maximize Spell feat, you instead take double damage from it. The spell's damage ignores your spell resistance, energy resistance, energy immunities, and other protections against damage. If you take at least 25 points of damage from the spell, you regain one use of mythic power.

As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow a creature other than yourself that is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points to remain conscious and alive. The creature can't die from hit point damage until after the start of your next turn. You can extend this effect for 1 round at the start of your next turn by expending another use of mythic power as a free action. Though the creature can't be killed by hit point damage, any damage it takes still applies to its current hit points. When this ability's effect ends, the creature falls unconscious or dies if its current hit points or other circumstances would otherwise cause it to do so. The creature must be within 30 feet for you to start or extend this effect.

Use the bonuses to attack and damage from the least powerful weapon thrown (for example, if you have one +2 dagger and 20 masterwork daggers, the attacks are treated as masterwork daggers). Apply any effects of concealment for individual targets as normal. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.

Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn. This ability doesn't stack with haste or similar effects. An ally must be within 30 feet of you at the start of its turn to benefit from this ability.

Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they fail.

If a cursed item works normally for a period of time before its curse triggers (such as gauntlets of fumbling), the item stops working for you when the curse would normally trigger.

A perfect strike attack is made using your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals double the normal amount of damage, and this damage bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If the perfect strike is a critical hit, increase the critical multiplier for the attack by 1 (so a x2 weapon deals x3 damage). Damage that isn't multiplied on a critical hit isn't multiplied on a perfect strike. Perfect strike can be used in conjunction with any champion's strike if you expend uses of mythic power for each ability separately.
Precision Critical		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Precision Critical			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:Whenever you score a critical hit, double any extra precision damage dice, such as sneak attack damage.

As a full-round action, you can make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus. If you hit and the target is flat-footed, deal damage as normal. You can then move and make another attack. You may continue this process until you miss, attack an opponent that isn't flat-footed, or attack an opponent you already hit this round. You can't move more than double your speed in this way in 1 round.
Sanctum				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Sanctum					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Archmage																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:You gain access to your own personal extradimensional sanctum. By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, you conjure the door to your own personal sanctum, similar to mage's magnificent mansion, but with the following differences. The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it-a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door. As a full-round action, your familiar can enter or leave the sanctum from any square adjacent to you, without using the conjured door.
Servant of Balance		KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Servant of Balance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Hierophant																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:Whenever a critical hit is confirmed against you, the attack deals normal damage instead of critical damage.

Shatter Spells			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Shatter Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Champion																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:You can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.

The target must have at least one use of mythic power available. If the attack hits, attempt an opposed d20 roll against the target, adding your tier. If your total exceeds that of the target, the target loses one use of mythic power and you gain one use. You can use this ability on a given creature only once per day.

As an immediate action, when an ally within line of sight misses with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability to grant the ally the benefits of your surge ability on that attack roll or saving throw. The ally uses your surge die, and can apply the bonus after the result is revealed, possibly turning a failure into a success.
Sweeping Strike			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Sweeping Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Champion																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:Even when you're swarmed, your foes are not safe from danger. Whenever you could make a full attack, you may instead make a single attack at your highest attack bonus and apply the results to all opponents within your reach. Roll damage once and apply it to all opponents hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.
Take the Hit			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Take the Hit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Guardian																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:You are a living shield for your allies. Whenever an adjacent ally takes damage from a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can split the damage. You take half of the damage (rounded down), and your ally takes the remaining amount. This damage is not subject to any resistances or damage reduction you might have, but any such defenses the target of the attack possesses apply before the damage is split. You don't suffer any other effects from the attack (such as disease, grab, or poison).
Tongues				KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Tongues					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																								PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:You can understand and speak any language, as the tongues spell.

Whenever you use a spell, bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, you can designate any one creature affected by this bonus. The designated creature keeps this bonus for up to 24 hours. You can have only one creature designated in this way at a time. If you designate a new creature, the bonus immediately ends for the previous target. The creature you designate must be one of the targets when you cast the spell, start the performance, or use the class feature.
Undying Healer			KEY:Mythic Path Ability ~ Undying Healer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mythic Path Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Hierophant																																										PREVARGTEQ:MythicTierLevel,6																																						DESC:Whenever you fall unconscious, a ghostly image of you manifests from out of your body. Even though you're unconscious, you control this image. On your turn each round, this image can fly up to 30 feet and use your ability to lay on hands to heal, channel energy to heal, or cast any conjuration (healing) spell that you could cast. This consumes these abilities as normal. Abilities used by the image can't benefit you. This image lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. This ability can be dispelled, using double your tier as the caster level. If you die or regain consciousness, the image immediately ends.

Legendary Item ~ Legendary Power	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Legendary Item	DEFINE:LegendaryPowerTimes|0		DESC:All legendary items contain a pool of power--at least two uses that recharge each day. This power is called legendary power, and it works differently than mythic power. Any creature bearing the item can expend the items uses of legendary power, whether or not that creature is mythic. These uses of legendary power can be expended only to activate the legendary item's abilities. If the item's bearer isn't bonded to the item, she can expend the item's legendary power only to use its legendary surge ability.

Legendary Item ~ Legendary Surge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Legendary Item	DEFINE:LegendarySurgeDieSize|0	DESC:All legendary items have a legendary surge ability, similar to a mythic character's surge ability. It can be used only on specific rolls or checks based on the nature or purpose of the legendary item. The legendary surge ability allows the bearer to add the result of a d6 to the appropriate type of roll or check. A mythic bearer can use her surge die type in place of the d6. If she's bonded to the item, she can increase that die type by one step.
