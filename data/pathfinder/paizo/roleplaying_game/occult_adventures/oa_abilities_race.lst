Link				KEY:Phantom Companion ~ Link				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phantom Companion.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:A spiritualist and her phantom share a mental link that allows for communication across distances (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action that can be performed even when it isn't the spiritualist's turn, but the spiritualist and the phantom must both be conscious to communicate in this way. This allows the spiritualist to give orders to her phantom at any time. Magic items interfere with a spiritualist's connection to her phantom; as a result, the spiritualist and her phantom share magic item slots. For example, if the spiritualist is wearing a magic ring, her phantom can wear only one magic ring. In the case of a conf lict, the items worn by the spiritualist remain active, and those worn by the phantom become dormant. The phantom must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.
Share Spells		KEY:Phantom Companion ~ Share Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phantom Companion.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:The spiritualist can cast a spell with a target of “you” on her phantom (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A spiritualist can cast spells from the spiritualist spell list on her phantom even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the phantom's type (outsider). This ability does not allow the phantom to share abilities that aren't spells, even if they function like spells.
Deliver Touch Spells	KEY:Phantom Companion ~ Deliver Touch Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phantom Companion.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:The phantom can deliver touch spells for the spiritualist when fully manifested in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. The spiritualist and the phantom need not be in contact to accomplish this, but the phantom must be within 30 feet and the spiritualist must be able to see the phantom. If the spiritualist is 12th level or higher, the phantom can deliver touch spells within 50 feet of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can cast the spell, and then the phantom can deliver the touch as an immediate action. If the touch spell deals damage, the phantom must make the attack roll. The phantom can't hold the charge of a touch spell cast by the spiritualist using this ability. If the spell is delivered to the phantom, it must touch a target or the spell is lost. If the spell allows you to touch up to six willing targets, the phantom can accomplish this with an immediate action, but all of the willing targets must be within the phantom's melee reach at the time.

It gains the incorporeal subtype (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 301), including a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modif ier.

An incorporeal manifested phantom can make slam attacks against other incorporeal creatures as if it were in ectoplasmic form.	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|PhantomArmorBonus|TYPE=Dodge

Anger		KEY:Emotional Focus ~ Anger		SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 1	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus.SpecialQuality	DESC:Phantoms with this emotional focus are filled with seething anger from events in their past lives. Phantoms with this focus often take the form of hulking brutes with furrowed brows or of frenzied creatures that always seem ready to strike down those who come too near. Many times, these phantoms exude a bright red aura, especially when they are engaged in combat, or they seem to breathe a red mist in shallow pants from behind clenched, phantasmal teeth.

It's often the case that a phantom with this emotional focus has a strong familial tie with its spiritualist master. A dedication phantom most often appears as a strong and stern protector with a watchful gaze, and its service to its spiritualist is unwavering. These spirits exude auras of blue, or sometimes rose if their love for their spiritualist masters in life was great. Many times these auras manifest as a halo, giving these phantoms a divine appearance, no matter their actual alignment or opinions on matters of religion.

Phantoms with this focus use misery as a weapon, inf licting the living with the gloom of the phantoms' continued existence. Despair phantoms often appear twisted or wounded, showing the grisly circumstances of their demise. Their coloration tends to have a grayish or sickly green cast. When they speak, they do so in terrifying whispers or high-pitched screeches.

As a phantom, it is able to channel that fear into a terrifying weapon. Fear phantoms are often horrifying to behold. Sometimes they appear as ghostly figures in tattered funeral garb or wrapped in chains or other bindings. Their features may be distorted into gaunt and haunting forms, making them seem more like ghosts or spectres. A miasma of livid gray swirling motes often surrounds their forms as they stalk their surroundings, seeking to bestow their terror on others.

Hatred	KEY:Emotional Focus ~ Hatred		SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 1	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus.SpecialQuality	DESC:Few things draw a spirit toward the Negative Material Plane like the emotion of hatred. Phantoms with this focus often are blinded by-and blind others with-this powerful emotion. These phantoms are frequently darker and more foreboding than all but those phantoms with the fear emotional focus. Many of them manifest as dark and dreadful knights, their armor bristling with spikes and their hands seeming to grasp barbed and terrible weapons. Other times they appear as tall, gaunt figures staring down arrogantly at those who approach. These phantoms typically spew a string of curses at their foes, often profane, sometimes poetic. Their auras are pulsating and pitch black, and thrum violently when these horrible phantoms attack.

Jealousy	KEY:Emotional Focus ~ Jealousy	SORTKEY:Emotional Focus 1	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus.SpecialQuality	DESC:A phantom with this emotional focus is covetous of everything-its master, those who wish to do it harm, and any who do not pay attention to it. It demands to be the center of attention at all times. The forms these phantoms take are as diverse as the forms of jealousy in life. Often they take pleasing forms, wishing to draw others in. Other times they take the form of crawling and lurching things, grasping at all they covet when they come within reach. The auras of these needy phantoms quickly change in color, going from an oily green to orange, to brownish red as they swirl through emotions in their efforts to gain the objects of their dark desires.

The most basic commands are treated as life-and-death situations, and the truly dangerous ones are faced with a resolve and tenacity that sometimes defies common sense. Zeal phantoms take the form of steadfast protectors or daring and manic creatures looking for the next challenge or opportunity to prove itself to either its master or itself. Often very prideful creatures, these phantoms display an orange aura upon completing their tasks. They are prone to boast about their accomplishments and chastise those around them for not accomplishing more.
