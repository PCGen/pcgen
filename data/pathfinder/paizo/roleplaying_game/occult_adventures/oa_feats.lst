Bleeding Stare													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Stare				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																				PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=5																																																																																																DESC:Your stare causes your foe to bleed out of its eyes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.129	BENEFIT:When you trigger your painful stare, the target takes an amount of bleed damage equal to 1/3 your mesmerist level.

Chakra Adept													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Chakra Initiate																																																																																PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8																						PRETEXT:Ability to awaken the heart chakra.											DESC:Your body and soul have grown more accustomed to kundalini energy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	BENEFIT:Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 4 points. When you maintain your chakras as a swift action without opening a new chakra, you can choose to attempt either the Fortitude save or the Will save instead of both. In addition, after you stop spending ki to maintain your chakras, the kundalini energy lingers in your body. On the first round during which you spend no ki to maintain your chakras, your highest chakra closes and you can spend a swift action to use any one of the abilities of your remaining open chakras. On the next round after that, all of your chakras close, and you must spend 1 point of ki and a swift action to start again from your root chakra.
Chakra Initiate													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool																										PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psychic Sensitivity],[PRECLASS:1,TYPE.Psychic=1]																																							PREPCLEVEL:MIN=2																						PRETEXT:Ability to awaken the root chakra.

SOURCEPAGE:p.129	BENEFIT:You gain a pool that holds 3 points of serpent-fire ki, which you can use only to open or maintain chakras.

DESC:You have mastered all seven chakras, and use your ki to pull more power from the kundalini flow.

Compounded Pain													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																				PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=13																																																																																																DESC:Your painful stare causes two additional effects.

Delay Blast														CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																																																																																																															PRETOTALAB:3						DESC:You can delay your kinetic blasts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.129	BENEFIT:When you use a kinetic blast, you can specify a number of rounds between 1 and 5. When that number of rounds has passed, the kinetic blast takes effect at the beginning of your turn. In the interim, you can take a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to cause the blast to take effect earlier than you initially selected. If you delay another blast while you already have a delayed blast pending, the previous delayed blast dissipates harmlessly. You must make any decisions you would make about the delayed blast-including designating target positions, choosing infusions, and determining or shaping the area-when you first use the blast. The blast originates from your position at the time you used the blast, not your current position when the blast takes effect, and it targets the position or area you had specified (which may or may not include any targets). A delayed blast radiates an aura of magic appropriate for its spell level even while it is delayed, and during that time, it can be dispelled by dispel magic.
Demoralizing Stare												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Stare				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																				PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=9																																																																																																DESC:Your painful stare inspires fear in your foes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	BENEFIT:When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will Save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 1 round.

SOURCEPAGE:p.132	BENEFIT:Twice per day when you shift mental focus from one implement to another, you can add the same number of points to the latter implement that you removed from the former.

In addition, once per day, you can extend the duration of a psychic spell you cast by 50%% (minimum 0 additional rounds). The increased duration doesn't stack with the increase granted by the Extend Spell feat.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Elongated Cranium ~ Fronto-Occipital Elongation	DESC: Ovoid Compression: Your head takes on a larger, more bulbous appearance than normal. You take a -1 penalty on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom- and Charisma-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks. In addition, once per day you can cast one psychic magic spell you know with a +1 bonus to its caster level.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Elongated Cranium ~ Ovoid Compression	DESC: Sagittal Elongation: Your head slopes back in a gentle, elongated curve. You take a -1 penalty on Intelligence and Charisma checks and on Intelligence- and Charisma-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks. In addition, once per day, you can increase the DC of a psychic spell you cast by 1.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Elongated Cranium ~ Sagittal Elongation	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITYSELECTION|Internal|TYPE=Elongated Cranium															SOURCEPAGE:p.132	BENEFIT:Your cranium has been tightly bound with boards and wrappings to change its shape and attune your mind to your psychic discipline.

SOURCEPAGE:p.132	BENEFIT:You gain familiarity with a number of additional spells based on the emotional focus of your phantom. These spells are added to both your class spell list (if not already on that list) and your list of spells known; they are in addition to the normal number of spells known for your level.

Empath														CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																								PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psychic Sensitivity],[PRESPELLCAST:TYPE=Psychic]																																												PRESKILL:1,Perception=1,Sense Motive=1																															DESC:You have learned how to psychically sense an individual's mood or altered mental state.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.132	BENEFIT:You can use either Perception or Sense Motive when reading an emotion aura with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature's emotion aura takes you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a fear or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate, strong, as defined in detect magic). You don't learn the source of the effect or the actual effect. You can also use the read aura occult skill unlock to read emotion auras more than once per day by opening your innate mental defenses. For 1 minute after you use this feat, you take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects (regardless of whether you succeeded at the check). During this time, you're also unable to attempt to read emotion auras. Using this feat doesn't use up your one daily use of the read aura unlock, which you can still use either to read another type of aura or to read an emotion aura without taking the penalty associated with this feat.
Excoriating Stare													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Stare				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																				PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=11																																																																																																DESC:Your painful stare burns through your opponents.

SOURCEPAGE:p.133	BENEFIT:Select an implement school. When you place mental focus points into an implement of that school, you can choose to gain benefits from the resonant power as if you had placed only half as many points of mental focus into the implement. If you do, you can extend the same benefits to one additional ally within 30 feet at the time you invest mental focus. If the ally moves outside of the extended power's range, the power is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the ally moves within range again. You can spend 1 point of mental focus from your implement to pass the effect to a new target, so long as both the original target and the new one are within 30 feet. This feat can affect only one implement from a given school at a time, even if you have selected the same implement school more than once. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, select a different implement school.
Extended Stare													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare																																																																																																																							DESC:Your hypnotic stare has greater reach than normal.

Fatiguing Stare													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Stare				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																				PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=7																																																																																																DESC:Your painful stare fatigues your opponent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:When a target takes damage from your painful stare, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become exhausted, even if the target is already fatigued.
Fearsome Spell													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																							DESC:Your spells inspire great fear in those harmed by them.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:When a creature takes damage from a fearsome spell, if that creature failed its save against the spell, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original level. If the spell doesn't allow a save, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the spell would have if it did allow a save) to negate the shaken effect. If the spell effect already causes creatures to become shaken, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the shaken condition imposed by the spell. A fearsome spell can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken. A fearsome spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
Focused Phantom													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spiritualist ~ Spiritual Interference																																																																																																																					DESC:Your close bond with your phantom helps you to focus your concentration.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:While you are adjacent to your phantom or your phantom is within your consciousness, you receive a +4 bonus on concentration checks.
Furious Spell													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																							DESC:Your spells seethe with the ferocious intensity of your blood-red rage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:A furious spell that deals hit point damage adds twice the spell's original level to the amount of damage dealt by the spell. Spells that affect multiple targets deal the extra damage once to each target, regardless of whether the spell deals its damage all at once or in multiple hits (in the latter case, add the extra damage to the first hit against each target). In addition, a furious spell can be cast while the caster is enraged, including during a barbarian rage or while affected by a rage spell. Even a furious spell that requires an emotion component can be cast while enraged. The caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks related to casting a furious spell if she is enraged. A furious spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
Greater Mesmerizing Feint											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mesmerizing Feint	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare,Bold Stare ~ Psychic Inception																																																																					PRESKILL:1,Bluff=10																																		DESC:You can feint against nearly any creature.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:You can feint against mindless creatures at a -4 penalty. Such a creature must be a subject of your hypnotic stare, and the creature has a 50%% chance of ignoring the effects of your feint.
Hidden Presence													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																																																									PRESPELL:1,Possession,Possession (Greater)	PRESTAT:1,INT=17,CHA=17																			DESC:You are adept at hiding within your host.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.135	BENEFIT:While possessing another creature, you can hide yourself from divinations and pass through wards such as magic circle against evil or the effects of a forbiddance spell. You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn't normally allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host's alignment, and forbiddance keyed to the host's alignment wouldn't damage you). If your saving throw fails, the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save, your previous failure doesn't count as a failed save against the spell's normal effects.
Implement Focus													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																				PRECLASS:1,Occultist=3																																																																																																DESC:You are more adept at spending generic focus on focus powers from your chosen school.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.135	BENEFIT:Select one of your implement schools. When you spend generic focus to activate focus powers with one of that school's implements, the focus powers cost their listed amount of mental focus. Normal: Any focus power activated with generic focus costs twice as much focus to use and maintain. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must select a different implement school.
Intense Pain													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Stare				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																				PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=7																																																																																																DESC:You deal additional damage when using your painful stare.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	BENEFIT:When you use your painful stare ability to increase your own damage, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at mesmerist level 12th and to 3d6 at mesmerist level 18th. When you use painful stare to augment an ally's damage, the target of the painful stare takes 1 additional point of damage for every 4 mesmerist levels you possess.
Interweave Composite Blast											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat.Teamwork				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																																																																																																																							DESC:You can combine your blasts with those of another kineticist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	BENEFIT:Whenever you are within 15 feet of another character who has this feat, you can ready an action to activate a simple blast of your choice. When that character unleashes a simple blast, yours is triggered, creating a composite blast for which the two simple blasts meet the prerequisites. The composite blast's caster level is equal to the average of the caster levels of both participants and deals damage as the appropriate composite blast created by a kineticist of that level (for example, if a 10th-level pyrokineticist and a 6thlevel hydrokineticist worked together to create a steam blast, its base damage would be 4d6+4 points of fire damage and 4d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage). One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast). However, whatever metakinesis she applies affects the entire composite blast. If the two participants aren't adjacent to each other, the origin point of cones, lines, and other effects that normally originate from a character's square instead originate from a point in the square located halfway between the two participants in a straight line (where the two simple blasts meet and form the composite blast). The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier.
Intimidating Glance												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General.Combat					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare																																																																																																																							DESC:Your gaze strikes fear into your enemies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.135	BENEFIT:You can attempt to demoralize the target of your hypnotic stare as a swift action. Normal: Attempting to demoralize an opponent is a standard action.
Intrusive Presence												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hidden Presence,Manipulative Presence																																																																																									PRESPELL:1,Possession,Possession (Greater)	PRESTAT:1,INT=21,CHA=21																			DESC:You can rif le through the thoughts and memories of your host.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	BENEFIT:You can use detect thoughts at will as a spelllike ability against a host creature you possess. The host receives no saving throw, and the effect functions as if you had concentrated for 3 rounds. You can also use seek thoughts on your host as a spell-like ability once during the possession. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to the DC of the original possession effect. If the host succeeds, the effect fails and the host become aware of the possession if it wasn't already.
Intuitive Spell													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																							DESC:You can avoid the need for thought components by trusting your instincts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BENEFIT:An intuitive spell can be cast with no thought components. Spells without thought components are not affected. An intuitive spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
Kinetic Counter													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Cold Blast,Wild Talent ~ Fire Blast,Wild Talent ~ Water Blast																																																																																																				DESC:You can use your kinetic blast to counter your enemy's opposing elemental abilities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BENEFIT:You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent's elemental abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor, and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor. In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent's caster level (for spells and spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent's Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using dispel magic. Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability's effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon's breath weapon, she negates the breath weapon's effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again.
Kinetic Leap													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=3																																		DESC:Kinetic energy propels you when you jump.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can conjure a burst of energy from your kinetic blast to help you jump a long distance, adding a +10 bonus on your Acrobatics check to jump; if you have at least 10 ranks in Acrobatics, the bonus increases to +20. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can use this ability at will until your burn is removed.
Logical Spell													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																							DESC:You can eschew emotional components by exercising logic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.137	BENEFIT:A logical spell can be cast without emotion components. Spells that don't require emotion components are not affected. A logical spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
Lucid Dreamer													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3										PRESTAT:1,CHA=13																				DESC:The Dimension of Dreams is open to those willing to risk crossing the threshold.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.137	BENEFIT:You have greater control of the highly morphic qualities and wild magic of the Dimension of Dreams. You gain a +4 bonus on Charisma checks to determine your initial condition when your lucid body (see page 242) enters a dream and when attempting impossible feats in a dreamscape, and a +2 bonus on caster level checks to prevent a spell or spell-like ability from going awry because of wild magic.
