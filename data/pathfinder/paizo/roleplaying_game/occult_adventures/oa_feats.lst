Bleeding Stare			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat.Stare	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your stare causes your foe to bleed out of its eyes.																PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=5	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																					BENEFIT:When you trigger your painful stare, the target takes an amount of bleed damage equal to 1/3 your mesmerist level.

Chakra Adept			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your body and soul have grown more accustomed to kundalini energy.														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Chakra Initiate	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=8	PRETEXT:Ability to awaken the heart chakra.																	BENEFIT:Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 4 points. When you maintain your chakras as a swift action without opening a new chakra, you can choose to attempt either the Fortitude save or the Will save instead of both. In addition, after you stop spending ki to maintain your chakras, the kundalini energy lingers in your body. On the first round during which you spend no ki to maintain your chakras, your highest chakra closes and you can spend a swift action to use any one of the abilities of your remaining open chakras. On the next round after that, all of your chakras close, and you must spend 1 point of ki and a swift action to start again from your root chakra.
Chakra Initiate			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:You have an extra wellspring of kundalini energy that you can use to open your chakras.

BENEFIT:You gain a pool that holds 3 points of serpent-fire ki, which you can use only to open or maintain chakras.

PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Chakra Adept,Chakra Initiate	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=14	PRETEXT:Ability to awaken the crown chakra.															BENEFIT:Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 5 points. You can spend 3 ki points instead of 1 when you open or maintain a chakra to gain the benefits of two chakras instead of one in that round.

Compounded Pain			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat		SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your painful stare causes two additional effects.																PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																					BENEFIT:You can apply the effects of two stare feats to your painful stares.

Delay Blast				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:You can delay your kinetic blasts.																			PRETOTALAB:3	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																						BENEFIT:When you use a kinetic blast, you can specify a number of rounds between 1 and 5. When that number of rounds has passed, the kinetic blast takes effect at the beginning of your turn. In the interim, you can take a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to cause the blast to take effect earlier than you initially selected. If you delay another blast while you already have a delayed blast pending, the previous delayed blast dissipates harmlessly. You must make any decisions you would make about the delayed blast-including designating target positions, choosing infusions, and determining or shaping the area-when you first use the blast. The blast originates from your position at the time you used the blast, not your current position when the blast takes effect, and it targets the position or area you had specified (which may or may not include any targets). A delayed blast radiates an aura of magic appropriate for its spell level even while it is delayed, and during that time, it can be dispelled by dispel magic.
Demoralizing Stare		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat.Stare	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your painful stare inspires fear in your foes.																	PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=9	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																					BENEFIT:When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will Save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 1 round.

If you take this feat after 1st level, you must undergo a painful 6-month regimen of increased tightening and head binding, during which you take a -1 penalty on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks. Once the binding is completed, your skull takes on one of three shapes of your choosing, each with a specific benefit. Once chosen, this shape cannot be changed. Fronto-Occipital Elongation: Your head slopes severely in a high conical shape, tapering from your brow to the crown of your head. You take a -1 penalty on Intelligence and Wisdom checks and on Intelligence- and Wisdombased skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, once per day, you can extend the duration of a psychic spell you cast by 50%% (minimum 0 additional rounds). The increased duration doesn't stack with the increase granted by the Extend Spell feat. Ovoid Compression: Your head takes on a larger, more bulbous appearance than normal. You take a -1 penalty on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom- and Charisma-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks. In addition, once per day you can cast one psychic magic spell you know with a +1 bonus to its caster level. Sagittal Elongation: Your head slopes back in a gentle, elongated curve. You take a -1 penalty on Intelligence and Charisma checks and on Intelligence- and Charismabased skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks.

PRESKILL:1,Perception=1,Sense Motive=1	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psychic Sensitivity],[PRESPELLCAST:TYPE=Psychic]														BENEFIT:You can use either Perception or Sense Motive when reading an emotion aura with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature's emotion aura takes you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a fear or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate, strong, as defined in detect magic). You don't learn the source of the effect or the actual effect. You can also use the read aura occult skill unlock to read emotion auras more than once per day by opening your innate mental defenses. For 1 minute after you use this feat, you take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects (regardless of whether you succeeded at the check). During this time, you're also unable to attempt to read emotion auras. Using this feat doesn't use up your one daily use of the read aura unlock, which you can still use either to read another type of aura or to read an emotion aura without taking the penalty associated with this feat.
Excoriating Stare			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat.Stare	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:Your painful stare burns through your opponents.																	PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=11	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																					BENEFIT:Whenever you trigger a painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened by the pain for 1 round.
Expanded Phrenic Pool		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:Your reservoir of mental energy is greater than normal.															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Psychic ~ Phrenic Pool																									BENEFIT:Your phrenic pool total increases by 2 points.

PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=7],[PREVARGTEQ:CasterLevel_Highest,7]	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Occultist ~ Mental Focus													BENEFIT:Select an implement school. When you place mental focus points into an implement of that school, you can choose to gain benefits from the resonant power as if you had placed only half as many points of mental focus into the implement. If you do, you can extend the same benefits to one additional ally within 30 feet at the time you invest mental focus. If the ally moves outside of the extended power's range, the power is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the ally moves within range again. You can spend 1 point of mental focus from your implement to pass the effect to a new target, so long as both the original target and the new one are within 30 feet. This feat can affect only one implement from a given school at a time, even if you have selected the same implement school more than once. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, select a different implement school.

PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Psychic ~ Phrenic Amplifications																								BENEFIT:You gain one additional phrenic amplification. This can't be a major amplification. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain another phrenic amplification.
Extra Focus Power			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:You gain an additional focus power from your implements.															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Occultist ~ Focus Powers																									BENEFIT:You gain one additional focus power from among those available from your chosen implement schools. You must select a power for which you normally qualify. Special: You can choose this feat once for every implement school you know, up to a maximum of seven times at 18th level. Each time you do, you must choose a different focus power.

You can select an infusion or a non-infusion wild talent, but not a blast or defense wild talent. If you have the expanded element class feature, you can select a wild talent from any of your elements that's at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wild talent from your primary element that you can currently use. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must choose a different wild talent.
Fatiguing Stare			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat.Stare	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	DESC:Your painful stare fatigues your opponent.																		PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=7	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																					BENEFIT:When a target takes damage from your painful stare, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become exhausted, even if the target is already fatigued.
Fearsome Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	DESC:Your spells inspire great fear in those harmed by them.																																																		BENEFIT:When a creature takes damage from a fearsome spell, if that creature failed its save against the spell, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original level. If the spell doesn't allow a save, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the spell would have if it did allow a save) to negate the shaken effect. If the spell effect already causes creatures to become shaken, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the shaken condition imposed by the spell. A fearsome spell can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken. A fearsome spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
Focused Phantom			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	DESC:Your close bond with your phantom helps you to focus your concentration.												PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spiritualist ~ Spiritual Interference																							BENEFIT:While you are adjacent to your phantom or your phantom is within your consciousness, you receive a +4 bonus on concentration checks.
Furious Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	DESC:Your spells seethe with the ferocious intensity of your blood-red rage.																																																BENEFIT:A furious spell that deals hit point damage adds twice the spell's original level to the amount of damage dealt by the spell. Spells that affect multiple targets deal the extra damage once to each target, regardless of whether the spell deals its damage all at once or in multiple hits (in the latter case, add the extra damage to the first hit against each target). In addition, a furious spell can be cast while the caster is enraged, including during a barbarian rage or while affected by a rage spell. Even a furious spell that requires an emotion component can be cast while enraged. The caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks related to casting a furious spell if she is enraged. A furious spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
Greater Mesmerizing Feint	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat		SOURCEPAGE:p.134	DESC:You can feint against nearly any creature.																		PRESKILL:1,Bluff=10	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mesmerizing Feint	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare,Bold Stare ~ Psychic Inception								BENEFIT:You can feint against mindless creatures at a -4 penalty. Such a creature must be a subject of your hypnotic stare, and the creature has a 50%% chance of ignoring the effects of your feint.
Hidden Presence			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	DESC:You are adept at hiding within your host.																		PRESTAT:1,INT=17,CHA=17	PRESPELL:1,Possession,Possession (Greater)																								BENEFIT:While possessing another creature, you can hide yourself from divinations and pass through wards such as magic circle against evil or the effects of a forbiddance spell. You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn't normally allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host's alignment, and forbiddance keyed to the host's alignment wouldn't damage you). If your saving throw fails, the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save, your previous failure doesn't count as a failed save against the spell's normal effects.
Implement Focus			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	DESC:You are more adept at spending generic focus on focus powers from your chosen school.										PRECLASS:1,Occultist=3																																BENEFIT:Select one of your implement schools. When you spend generic focus to activate focus powers with one of that school's implements, the focus powers cost their listed amount of mental focus. Normal: Any focus power activated with generic focus costs twice as much focus to use and maintain. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must select a different implement school.
Intense Pain			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat.Stare	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	DESC:You deal additional damage when using your painful stare.															PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=7	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Painful Stare																					BENEFIT:When you use your painful stare ability to increase your own damage, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at mesmerist level 12th and to 3d6 at mesmerist level 18th. When you use painful stare to augment an ally's damage, the target of the painful stare takes 1 additional point of damage for every 4 mesmerist levels you possess.
Interweave Composite Blast	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat.Teamwork	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	DESC:You can combine your blasts with those of another kineticist.														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																									BENEFIT:Whenever you are within 15 feet of another character who has this feat, you can ready an action to activate a simple blast of your choice. When that character unleashes a simple blast, yours is triggered, creating a composite blast for which the two simple blasts meet the prerequisites. The composite blast's caster level is equal to the average of the caster levels of both participants and deals damage as the appropriate composite blast created by a kineticist of that level (for example, if a 10th-level pyrokineticist and a 6thlevel hydrokineticist worked together to create a steam blast, its base damage would be 4d6+4 points of fire damage and 4d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage). One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast). However, whatever metakinesis she applies affects the entire composite blast. If the two participants aren't adjacent to each other, the origin point of cones, lines, and other effects that normally originate from a character's square instead originate from a point in the square located halfway between the two participants in a straight line (where the two simple blasts meet and form the composite blast). The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier.
Intimidating Glance		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	DESC:Your gaze strikes fear into your enemies.																		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare																									BENEFIT:You can attempt to demoralize the target of your hypnotic stare as a swift action. Normal: Attempting to demoralize an opponent is a standard action.
Intrusive Presence		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	DESC:You can rif le through the thoughts and memories of your host.														PRESTAT:1,INT=21,CHA=21	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hidden Presence,Manipulative Presence	PRESPELL:1,Possession,Possession (Greater)													BENEFIT:You can use detect thoughts at will as a spelllike ability against a host creature you possess. The host receives no saving throw, and the effect functions as if you had concentrated for 3 rounds. You can also use seek thoughts on your host as a spell-like ability once during the possession. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to the DC of the original possession effect. If the host succeeds, the effect fails and the host become aware of the possession if it wasn't already.
Intuitive Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	DESC:You can avoid the need for thought components by trusting your instincts.																																															BENEFIT:An intuitive spell can be cast with no thought components. Spells without thought components are not affected. An intuitive spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
Kinetic Counter			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	DESC:You can use your kinetic blast to counter your enemy's opposing elemental abilities.											PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Cold Blast,Wild Talent ~ Fire Blast,Wild Talent ~ Water Blast						BENEFIT:You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent's elemental abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor, and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor. In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent's caster level (for spells and spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent's Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using dispel magic. Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability's effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon's breath weapon, she negates the breath weapon's effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again.
Kinetic Leap			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	DESC:Kinetic energy propels you when you jump.																		PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=3	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																					BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can conjure a burst of energy from your kinetic blast to help you jump a long distance, adding a +10 bonus on your Acrobatics check to jump; if you have at least 10 ranks in Acrobatics, the bonus increases to +20. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can use this ability at will until your burn is removed.
Logical Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	DESC:You can eschew emotional components by exercising logic.																																																		BENEFIT:A logical spell can be cast without emotion components. Spells that don't require emotion components are not affected. A logical spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
Lucid Dreamer			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	DESC:The Dimension of Dreams is open to those willing to risk crossing the threshold.											PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3																											BENEFIT:You have greater control of the highly morphic qualities and wild magic of the Dimension of Dreams. You gain a +4 bonus on Charisma checks to determine your initial condition when your lucid body (see page 242) enters a dream and when attempting impossible feats in a dreamscape, and a +2 bonus on caster level checks to prevent a spell or spell-like ability from going awry because of wild magic. If someone casts a dream council spell that includes you as a target while you are dreaming, you can enter a shared dreamscape as described in that spell without spending a casting of dream or dream council. If your lucid body dies while in a dreamscape, you wake up fatigued.
Manipulative Presence		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	DESC:When you discard your host, you alter or obliterate its memory of your handiwork.											PRESTAT:1,INT=19,CHA=19	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hidden Presence	PRESPELL:1,Possession,Possession (Greater)																BENEFIT:Upon completion of your possession, you can alter up to 5 minutes of your host's memories as you see fit. This functions as the modify memory spell. Your host's awareness of the possession doesn't impact this ability, and if your control of the host lasted less than 5 minutes, you can cause it to forget the possession entirely. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to that of the original possession effect to resist this alteration.
Mesmerizing Feint			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Combat		SOURCEPAGE:p.137	DESC:You're adept at feinting against even the least imaginative of creatures.												PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare																									BENEFIT:You take only a -2 penalty when feinting against a non-humanoid and a -4 penalty when feinting against creatures with animal intelligence, as long as the target is a subject of your hypnotic stare. If you have at least 10 ranks in Bluff, you instead take no penalty when feinting against non-humanoids and creatures of animal intelligence under your hypnotic stare. Normal: When feinting against a non-humanoid, you take a -4 penalty. Against a creature of animal intelligence, you take a -8 penalty.
Parting Blast			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	DESC:When you die, your body explodes in one final, destructive kinetic blast.												PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast																									BENEFIT:You can accept 1 point of burn to prepare a kinetic blast that automatically triggers upon your death. If you are killed at any point before your burn is removed, your body instantly erupts in an explosion that deals an amount of damage equal to that of your simple blast to all creatures in a 5-foot radius. A parting blast destroys your body, which might prevent any magic that requires an intact corpse.
Phantom Fighter			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	DESC:Your phantom is a deadly foe of incorporeal adversaries.															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spiritualist ~ Phantom	PREVARGTEQ:PhantomMasterLVL,4	PRETEXT:Phantom with the magic attacks ability.												BENEFIT:Your phantom's natural weapons are treated as having the ghost touch property. In addition, when you cast a touch spell to be delivered by your phantom, you can modify the spell as if you possessed the Ectoplasmic SpellAPG metamagic feat.
Phantom Fortification		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	DESC:Your phantom remains partly immaterial even when fully manifested in ectoplasmic form.										PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spiritualist ~ Phantom	PREVARGTEQ:PhantomMasterLVL,9	PRETEXT:Phantom with the incorporeal flight ability.											BENEFIT:Your phantom has a 50%% chance of ignoring critical hits and precision-based damage when fully manifested in its ectoplasmic form, as if wearing armor with the moderate fortification special ability.
