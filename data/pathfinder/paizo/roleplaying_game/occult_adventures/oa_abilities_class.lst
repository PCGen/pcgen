Elemental Focus			KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:Pool_KineticistElementalFocus|0	DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist chooses one primary element on which to focus. This element determines how she accesses the raw power of the Ethereal Plane, and grants her access to specific wild talents (see below) and additional class skills. She can select aether (telekinesis), air (aerokinesis), earth (geokinesis), fire (pyrokinesis), or water (hydrokinesis). She gains her selected element's basic utility wild talent (basic telekinesis, basic aerokinesis, basic geokinesis, basic pyrokinesis, or basic hydrokinesis; see page 23) as a bonus wild talent. See Elements on page 14 for the specific abilities granted by each element.

Wild Talents			KEY:Kineticist ~ Wild Talents				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:A kineticist can use wild talents-magical abilities similar to spells but drawn from the kineticist's innate psychic talent and usable at will. Wild talents are typically spell-like abilities (though some are supernatural abilities), and take a standard action to use unless otherwise noted. A wild talent always has the elemental descriptor or descriptors (aether, air, earth, fire, or water) matching its Element entry. A wild talent that can be used with any of several elements gains the appropriate elemental descriptor when used with an element. For example, the wall wild talent gains the earth descriptor when used by a geokineticist. Every wild talent has an effective spell level. A kineticist can always select 1st-level wild talents, but she can select a wild talent of a higher level only if her kineticist level is at least double the wild talent's effective spell level. Kinetic blast and defense wild talents are always considered to have an effective spell level equal to 1/2 the kineticist's class level (to a maximum effective spell level of 9th at kineticist level 18th). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for a saving throw against a wild talent is equal to 10 + the wild talent's effective spell level + the kineticist's Constitution modifier. The kineticist uses her Constitution modifier on all concentration checks for wild talents. In addition to the wild talents she gains from her other class features, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a kineticist selects a new utility wild talent from the list of options available to her. A kineticist can select only universal wild talents or those that match her element (see Elemental Focus above). At 6th, 10th, and 16th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her utility wild talents with another wild talent of the same level or lower. She can't replace a wild talent that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents.

Burn					KEY:Kineticist ~ Burn					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist can overexert herself to channel more power than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for her body by accepting burn. Some of her wild talents allow her to accept burn in exchange for a greater effect, while others require her to accept a certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn she accepts, a kineticist takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per character level. This damage can't be healed by any means other than getting a full night's rest, which removes all burn and associated nonlethal damage. Nonlethal damage from burn can't be reduced or redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking nonlethal damage can't accept burn. A kineticist can accept only 1 point of burn per round. This limit rises to 2 points of burn at 6th level, and rises by 1 additional point every 3 levels thereafter. A kineticist can't choose to accept burn if it would put her total number of points of burn higher than 3 + her Constitution modifier (though she can be forced to accept more burn from a source outside her control). A kineticist who has accepted burn never benefits from abilities that allow her to ignore or alter the effects she receives from nonlethal damage.																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Kinetic Blast			KEY:Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist gains a kinetic blast wild talent of her choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches her element. As a standard action, the kineticist can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. She must have at least one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if she doesn't have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless of effects from form infusions; see Infusion on page 12), and she can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms). A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor. A kinetic blast that deals energy damage of any type (including force) has the corresponding descriptor. The various kinetic blasts, as well as additional rules for simple blasts, are described on pages 15-16.

Gather Power			KEY:Kineticist ~ Gather Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:If she has both hands free (or all of her prehensile appendages free, for unusual kineticists), a kineticist can gather energy or elemental matter as a move action. Gathering power creates an extremely loud, visible display in a 20-foot radius centered on the kineticist, as the energy or matter swirls around her. Gathering power in this way allows the kineticist to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent she uses in the same round by 1 point. The kineticist can instead gather power for 1 full round in order to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent used on her next turn by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points). If she does so, she can also gather power as a move action during her next turn to reduce the burn cost by a total of 3 points. If the kineticist takes damage during or after gathering power and before using the kinetic blast that releases it, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + damage taken + effective spell level of her kinetic blast) or lose the energy in a wild surge that forces her to accept a number of points of burn equal to the number of points by which her gathered power would have reduced the burn cost. This ability can never reduce the burn cost of a wild talent below 0 points.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Infusion				KEY:Kineticist ~ Infusion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist gains an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on her elemental focus. She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion. Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects. The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies. The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist's Dexterity modifier instead of her Constitution modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If a kineticist's form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast's damage, apply the substance infusion's alteration first. At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her infusions with another infusion of the same effective spell level or lower. She can't replace an infusion that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents. The descriptions of infusions begin on page 17.

Elemental Defense			KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 2nd level, a kineticist gains her element's defense wild talent ( the descriptions of defense wild talents begin on page 16).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Elemental Overflow		KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Overflow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:At 3rd level, a kineticist's body surges with energy from her chosen element whenever she accepts burn, causing her to glow with a nimbus of fire, weep water from her pores, or experience some other thematic effect. In addition, she receives a bonus on her attack rolls with kinetic blasts equal to the total number of points of burn she currently has, to a maximum bonus of +1 for every 3 kineticist levels she possesses. She also receives a bonus on damage rolls with her kinetic blast equal to double the bonus on attack rolls. The kineticist can suppress the visual effects of elemental overflow by concentrating for 1 full round, but doing so suppresses all of this ability's other benefits, as well. The next time the kineticist uses any wild talent, the visual effects and benefits return instantly. As a kineticist's body becomes more and more suffused with her element, she begins to gain more powerful benefits. Starting at 6th level, whenever she has at least 3 points of burn, the kineticist gains a +2 size bonus to two physical ability scores of her choice. She also gains a chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equal to 5%% x her current number of points of burn. At 11th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 5 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +4 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice and a +2 size bonus to each of her other two physical ability scores. At 16th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 7 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +6 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice, a +4 size bonus to a second physical ability score of her choice, and a +2 size bonus to the remaining physical ability score.																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Infusion Specialization		KEY:Kineticist ~ Infusion Specialization		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary								DESC:At 5th level, whenever a kineticist uses one or more infusions with a blast, she reduces the combined burn cost of the infusions by 1. This can't reduce the total cost of the infusions used below 0. She reduces the burn cost by 1 additional point at 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Metakinesis				KEY:Kineticist ~ Metakinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 5th level, a kineticist gains the ability to alter her kinetic blasts as if with metamagic feats by accepting burn. By accepting 1 point of burn, she can empower her kinetic blast (as if using Empower Spell). At 9th level, by accepting 2 points of burn, she can maximize her kinetic blast as if using Maximize Spell. At 13th level, by accepting 3 points of burn, she can quicken her kinetic blast as if using Quicken Spell. At 17th level, by accepting 4 points of burn, the kineticist can use her kinetic blast twice with the same standard action, or swift action if she also uses metakinesis to quicken the blast. When she uses a double kinetic blast, all modifications, such as metakinesis and infusions, apply to both of the blasts, but the kineticist needs to pay the burn cost only once.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Internal Buffer			KEY:Kineticist ~ Internal Buffer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 6th level, a kineticist's study of her body and the elemental forces that course through it allow her to form an internal buffer to store extra energy. The buffer starts empty and doesn't replenish each day, but the kineticist can accept 1 point of burn to add 1 point to the buffer as a full-round action, to a maximum of 1 point total. This maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level and to 3 points at 16th level. Once the kineticist adds points to her buffer, they remain indefinitely until she spends them. When she would otherwise accept burn, a kineticist can spend 1 point from her buffer to avoid accepting 1 point of burn. She cannot spend more than 1 point from her buffer in this way for a single wild talent. Points spent from the internal buffer don't activate elemental overflow or add to its effects. Similarly, this buffer can be used to exceed the limit on the number of points of burn the kineticist can accept in a single turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Expanded Element			KEY:Kineticist ~ Expanded Element			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 7th level, a kineticist learns to use another element or expands her understanding of her own element. She can choose any element, including her primary element. She gains one of that element's simple blast wild talents that she does not already possess, if any. She also gains all composite blast wild talents whose prerequisites she meets, as well as the basic wild talent of her chosen expanded element (for instance, basic aerokinesis if she chooses air). See Composite Blasts on page 15 for additional rules for and descriptions of composite blasts. She doesn't gain the defense wild talent of the expanded element. If the kineticist's expanded element is different from her primary element, she treats her kineticist level as 4 levels lower for the purpose of determining which wild talents she can learn from her expanded element. If the kineticist chooses to expand her understanding of an element she already has, she gains an additional utility wild talent or infusion of her choice from that element, as if from her infusion or wild talent class feature, as appropriate. At 15th level, the kineticist can either select a new element or expand her understanding of her original element. She can't select the same element she selected at 7th level unless it is her primary element. She gains all the benefits from her new expanded element as listed above. However, if the kineticist selected her primary element as her expanded element at both 7th and 15th levels, her mastery of that element increases. For wild talents of her element, the kineticist gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to caster level and DCs.

Supercharge				KEY:Kineticist ~ Supercharge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 11th level, when using gather power as a move action, a kineticist can reduce the total burn cost of a single wild talent by 2 points instead of 1. When using gather power for 1 full round, she can reduce the burn cost of a single wild talent by 3 points instead of 2.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Composite Specialization	KEY:Kineticist ~ Composite Specialization		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 16th level, a kineticist becomes more adept at creating composite blasts. She reduces the burn cost of all composite blasts by 1 point. This can't reduce the cost of a composite blast below 0 points.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Metakinetic Master		KEY:Kineticist ~ Metakinetic Master			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 19th level, a kineticist chooses one type of metakinesis, such as empower or quicken. She reduces the burn cost of that metakinesis by 1 point (to a minimum of 0 points).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Omnikinesis				KEY:Kineticist ~ Omnikinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:At 20th level, a kineticist transcends the distinction between the different elements and can bend all creation to her will. By accepting 1 point of burn (in addition to any burn requirement of the kinetic blast she chooses), she can use any blast wild talent she doesn't know. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, she can change any of her wild talents into any other wild talent of the same category (such as simple blasts or defense) for 24 hours, ignoring any elemental requirements or restrictions (but not any other requirements or restrictions).

Simple Blasts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	KEY:Kineticist Blast ~ Simple Blasts	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.KB_Simple		DESC:A kineticist gains a simple blast from her primary element at 1st level-some elements offer more than one option. When a kineticist gains a new element via the expanded element class feature, she gains a simple blast from that element as well. Each simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast. Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6+1 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. Spell resistance doesn't apply against physical blasts. Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.
Composite Blasts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	KEY:Kineticist Blast ~ Composite Blasts	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.KB_Composite		DESC:Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When a kineticist gains a new element through expanded element, she gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies. Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts, like simple blasts. Physical composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st; energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.

The object must weigh no more than 5 pounds per kineticist level you possess. If the attack hits, the target and the thrown object each take the blast's damage. Since the object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use this power on a magic weapon or other unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects; it simply deals your blast damage. Alternatively, you can loosen the strands of aether in order to deal damage to both the object and the target as though you had thrown the object yourself (instead of dealing your normal blast damage). You substitute your Constitution modifier for your Strength modifier if throwing the object would have added your Strength modifier on the damage roll, and you don't take the -4 penalty on the attack roll for throwing an object that wasn't designed to be thrown. In this case, the object's special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand; otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size.

# Elemental Defense
Enveloping Winds			KEY:Elemental Defense ~ Enveloping Winds			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:Element air; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 You constantly surround yourself with a whirling torrent of air, crackling arcs of lightning, or both to protect yourself from ranged attacks. All ranged attacks made with physical weapons suffer a 20%% miss chance against you, except for attacks from massive weapons such as a giant's thrown boulder or a ballista. This ability has no effect on ray attacks. The miss chance increases by 5%% for every 5 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the miss chance by 5%% until the next time your burn is removed. You can continue to accept points of burn to increase the miss chance further, up to a maximum of 75%%. Whenever you accept burn while using an air wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your enveloping winds to also affect non-physical ranged attacks such as ray attacks for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Flesh Of Stone			KEY:Elemental Defense ~ Flesh Of Stone			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:Element earth; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 Your skin hardens like stone, dampening the impact of most attacks. You gain DR 1/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 2 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the DR by 1 until the next time your burn is removed, to a maximum DR equal to your kineticist level. Whenever you accept burn while using an earth wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your damage reduction to change from DR/adamantine to DR/- for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Force Ward				KEY:Elemental Defense ~ Force Ward				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:Element aether; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your kineticist level. You always lose these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points. If an attack deals less damage than you still have as temporary hit points from force ward, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. These temporary hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, you can increase the maximum number of temporary hit points provided by your force ward by half your kineticist level until the next time your burn is removed. If you use this ability multiple times, the increases stack. For every 2 points of burn you accept in this way, your force ward's rate of regeneration increases by 1 hit point per minute. Whenever you accept burn while using an aether wild talent, you siphon some of the energy from the aether flowing through you and your force ward recovers a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level, up to its current maximum. You can dismiss or restore your force ward as an immediate action, but doing so doesn't change the number of temporary hit points available, and the temporary hit points don't recover while this ability is inactive.																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Searing Flesh			KEY:Elemental Defense ~ Searing Flesh			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:Element fire; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 Your body becomes painfully hot. Whenever a creature hits you with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, that creature takes 1 point of fire damage per 4 kineticist levels you possess (minimum 1 point of fire damage). A creature in a grapple with you takes double this amount of damage at the end of each of its turns. Weapons that strike you also take this damage, though the damage is unlikely to penetrate the weapon's hardness. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase this damage by 1 point per 4 kineticist levels you possess until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the damage in this way up to seven times. Whenever you accept burn while using a fire wild talent, the surging flame causes your searing flesh to deal double its current amount of damage for 1 round (a creature in a grapple with you takes a total of four times as much damage as normal). You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Shroud Of Water			KEY:Elemental Defense ~ Shroud Of Water			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Defense Wild Talent														DESC:Element water; Type defense (Su); Level -; Burn 0 You surround yourself with a shroud of water, ice, or both that protects you from harm. The shroud can either cover your body, functioning as armor, or float around you and block attacks, functioning as a shield. It grants either a +4 armor bonus to AC or a +2 shield bonus to AC, and you can change the type of bonus as a standard action. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the bonus by 1 until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the bonus multiple times in this way, but it can't be increased by more than 50%% of its starting value. When you change the shroud to grant a shield bonus, any bonus in excess of this limit doesn't apply, but it remains if you change the shroud's bonus type again. Whenever you accept burn while using a water wild talent, the water coalescing around you allows your shroud to grant both the armor bonus and the shield bonus for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.17

When you hit a target with your infused blast, you can attempt a ranged touch attack against an additional target that is within 30 feet of the first. Each additional attack originates from the previous target, which could alter cover and other conditions. Each additional target takes 1d6 fewer points of damage than the last (for example, 3d6 becomes 2d6), and you can't chain the blast back to a previous target. You can continue chaining your blasts until a blast misses or fails to deal damage, or until your blast is reduced to a single damage die.

All creatures and objects in contact with the ground within the area when you create it automatically take 1/4 of the normal damage from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the area, it takes half the normal damage from your blast, as do creatures that end their turns in the area. The entire area counts as difficult terrain. This infusion lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use it again.

Against creatures, your kinetic blast deals double its normal amount of damage, but targets receive a saving throw to reduce the damage to half the blast's normal amount of damage (for a total of 1/4 of the blast's increased damage). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the blast is disintegrated, as the spell disintegrate. You can use the infused blast to destroy force effects or objects as disintegrate, but for each force effect or 10-foot cube of nonliving matter you destroy in this way, you must accept 1 point of burn, which can't be reduced by effects such as infusion specialization or gather power.

When you use this infusion, your kinetic blast affects only creatures with a subtype matching your kinetic blast's element (for instance, a fire blast would damage only creatures of the fire subtype). Against such creatures, your blast targets touch AC (if it requires an attack roll) and always allows spell resistance. Because you are draining energy from the target, your blast doesn't apply your elemental overflow bonuses or Constitution modifier. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to take 1/4 the normal amount of damage. Draining infusion ignores any damage reduction, resistances, and immunities the creature might possess. If at least one creature fails its saving throw against your draining infusion, you can reduce the total burn cost of any one blast wild talent used before the end of your next turn by 1, or by 2 if you have the supercharge ability. If you use draining infusion again before applying this reduction, you still deal the damage from that draining infusion, but the burn reductions don't stack.

At 10th level, you can shoot three blasts with flurry of blasts; this increases to four blasts at 16th level and to five blasts at 20th level. If you are under the effect of haste or similar magic that increases your number of attacks in a fullattack action, the number of kinetic blasts in your flurry of blasts increases by 1. No two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. You must assign the targets of all your blasts before rolling any of the attacks. Any blast beyond the first that hits the same target adds 1d6 points of damage; bonuses and penalties to damage don't apply. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a saving throw, a target attempts its save only once (even if it was hit multiple times), but it takes a penalty on the save equal to the number of times it was hit beyond the first. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a caster level check or combat maneuver check, you roll the check only once against each target, but you gain a bonus on the check equal to the number of times that target was hit beyond the first.

Whenever a creature takes damage from the infused blast, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to have the blast grapple that opponent. Your bonus on this check is equal to 2 + your kineticist level + your Constitution modifier (treat the blast as a Huge creature). The blast only grapples opponents; it can't perform other functions of grapple maneuvers such as pinning or moving the opponent.

If the result is a critical threat, roll to confirm against only the first target you hit. Calculate damage against each target you hit, starting from the closest. If your attack hits a target but fails to deal physical damage to that target, the spike fails to penetrate and the infused blast doesn't continue.

You create a nonreach, light or one-handed weapon in your hand formed of pure energy or elemental matter. (If you're a telekineticist, you instead transfer the power of your kinetic blast to any object held in one hand.) The kinetic blade's shape is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the damage dice, critical threat range, or critical multiplier of the kinetic blade, nor does it grant the kinetic blade any weapon special features. The object held by a telekineticist for this form infusion doesn't prevent her from using gather power. You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it's part of another action (and isn't an action itself), using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attacks of opportunity. The kinetic blade deals your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage as normal, but not your Strength modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast deals, and it interacts with Armor Class and spell resistance as normal for a blast of its type. Even if a telekineticist uses this power on a magic weapon or another unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects and simply deals the telekineticist's blast damage. The kinetic blade doesn't add the damage bonus from elemental overflow.	SOURCEPAGE:p.20

You can use this form infusion as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action to add damage to each of your natural attacks and unarmed strikes until the beginning of your next turn. Since kinetic fist is part of another action, using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attack of opportunity. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per 3 dice of your kinetic blast's damage (minimum 1d6), and this damage is of the same type as your kinetic blast's damage.

Spirit				KEY:Medium ~ Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:SpiritBonus|0	DEFINE:SpiritHideLocation|0			DESC:A medium serves as a vessel to channel spirits-astral echoes of powerful souls from ages past that live on in myth and legend. Each day, a medium can channel a spirit through a ritual known as a seance. Seances take 1 hour to perform and require the medium's concentration. At the end of a seance, the medium invites a local spirit to inhabit him and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one of six legends. Though the medium can choose the legend to which the spirit he channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their legends. The medium gains the spirit's listed seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours. 	DESC:The medium also gains the spirit's intermediate spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,6	DESC:, its greater spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,11	DESC:, and its supreme spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,17	DESC:. After 24 hours, the medium loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform another seance.&nl; A medium can invite his allies to participate in his seance-shared seance and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike the medium, other participating characters can take other actions during this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can participate in a seance.&nl; In addition to granting power to the medium, a channeled spirit can influence the medium. By channeling a spirit, the medium allows the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the medium loses that 1 point of influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before the next seance, the spirit's influence over the medium resets to 0. Certain abilities allow the medium to gain additional power in exchange for allowing the spirit more influence over him.&nl; When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the medium, the dual impulses housed within the same body cause the medium to meld with his spirit's consciousness. The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the medium to take a -2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific additional penalty. However, the spirit's mental presence grants the medium a +4 bonus against possession effects and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are not related to possession.&nl; If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the medium, the medium completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone.&nl; During his seance, the medium can choose to channel a weaker spirit to gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so, he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the medium can use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence.

SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Taboo					KEY:Medium ~ Taboo				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:During his daily seance, a medium can accept a taboo in order to appease his spirit. Each spirit lists example taboos, and the GM may allow additional taboos as well. Accepting a taboo allows the medium to use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence. The medium can select only a single taboo. The medium is not magically prevented from breaking his taboo, but if he breaks the taboo for any reason, he takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 hour and his spirit gains 1 point of influence over him. If the medium continues violating the taboo while taking the penalty, the duration of the penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the medium. If a spirit attains 5 points of influence because of a violated taboo, instead of possessing the medium, the spirit leaves the medium's body entirely, and the medium loses access to his spirit powers, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities until the next time he can perform a seance. Banishing a spirit in this way damages the medium's connection to that spirit's legend; the medium cannot channel spirits of that legend for 1 week, and the next time the medium channels a spirit of that legend, it starts with 2 points of influence over him instead of 1.

He can always act on the surprise round against a haunt, and his touch funnels a portion of the haunt into himself, dealing %1d6 points of damage to the haunt as if via positive energy and allowing the medium to ask the haunt a single question. The haunt can answer the question however it chooses. Additionally, the medium can forgo his saving throw against a haunt's effects to funnel the haunt entirely into himself. If he does so, the medium suffers the haunt's full effect, but the haunt doesn't affect anyone else (even if it normally would). The haunt then gains control of the medium's body for 24 hours.

The other participants of the seance must ask the questions. Once the medium attempts to call a spirit, he cannot attempt to call the same spirit again for 24 hours.

Trance of Three			KEY:Medium ~ Trance of Three			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:TranceOfThreeDuration|0						DESC:As a swift action, a medium can allow his spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him in order to allow a portion of a legendary spirit from another legend to enter him for %1 rounds, granting him the intermediate spirit power from another legend. If that power has a limited number of uses per day, the medium must keep track of the remaining uses even after the secondary spirit is gone; if the medium calls the secondary spirit again that day, it can grant the remaining uses of that power. If the medium uses an ability that incurs influence, the medium's primary spirit gains that amount of influence over him, not the secondary spirit. The medium doesn't gain the benefits of his spirit bonus from the secondary spirit. The medium can end the trance of three early as a free action.|TraceOfThreeDuration																																																																																					BONUS:VAR|TraceOfThreeDuration|MediumLVL																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.32
Spacious Soul			KEY:Medium ~ Spacious Soul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															DESC:A medium's soul is spacious enough to provide a foothold for his fallen allies, if he so chooses. If one of the allies who participated in the medium's seance that day dies within line of effect and line of sight of the medium, the medium can spend an immediate action to accept that ally's spirit within him. Since the ally inhabits the portion of the medium's soul normally reserved for a spirit, this suppresses the medium's spirit, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities as long as the medium maintains this ability. The ally's spirit and the medium share the medium's body and can decide each round on the medium's turn which of them will take the medium's actions for that round. If they don't agree on who should act, they attempt opposed Charisma checks to determine who is dominant for the next hour, and the dominant character decides who acts on each round. The ally's spirit has all the spells and limited use abilities (such as uses of channel energy, ki, and panache) that it possessed at the time of death, but it is incapable of regaining any abilities, points, spells, or uses of abilities it expends. When the ally's spirit acts, it uses the ally's base attack bonus, caster level, and special abilities (such as weapon proficiency), but uses the medium's physical ability scores. If the ally returns to life, this ability immediately ends. Otherwise, the medium can maintain this ability indefinitely. The medium can end this effect as a standard action, though if the ally is unwilling to depart, the medium must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ally's hit dice + the ally's Charisma modifier) or the attempt fails and the ally becomes dominant for 24 hours.

Spirit Mastery			KEY:Medium ~ Spirit Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:The medium becomes a legend among spirits, particularly lesser spirits. He can use his spirit surge ability an additional two times per day without incurring influence, regardless of whether he accepts a taboo or channels a weaker spirit. When channeling a weaker spirit, he can use his spirit surge ability an additional four times per day for each power he forgoes, instead of an additional two times.

Astral Beacon			KEY:Medium ~ Astral Beacon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															DESC:A medium is an open connection to the Astral Plane and a shining beacon for spirits. As a free action, he can channel spirits of any of the five legends he did not contact via his seance. This ability lasts for 1 round and grants access to the intermediate, greater, and supreme spirit powers of the chosen spirits. Unlike trance of three, astral beacon allows spirits of the chosen legends (for instance, archmage) to gain influence over the medium until 24 hours from when the medium contacted his primary spirit. Also unlike trance of three, if the medium would incur influence by using one of the new spirits' abilities, that influence is added to the medium's total influence from that spirit rather than from his primary spirit.

That creature takes a -%1 penalty on Will saving throws. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.|HypnoticStarePenalty																																																																																																																																																																																																				BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|2	BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|1|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,8																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.39

Mesmerist Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Mesmerist Tricks Output		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant %1 of these tricks. He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).&nl; To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (%2 feet) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it-but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.&nl; Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is %3.&nl; The mesmerist knows %4 trick(s). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows.

A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of %1 to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the mesmerist's lies or force him to speak only the truth.

SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Rule Minds				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Rule Minds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:A mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force the creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell's DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn't a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can't be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.

###Block: Mesmerist Tricks
# Ability Name		Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																															Source Page
Astounding Avoidance	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Astounding Avoidance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage.	DESC:The subject takes only half damage is she fails her save. |PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,12	DESC:The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Compel Alacrity		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Compel Alacrity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move %1 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.|10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5)																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.40
False Flanker		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ False Flanker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Fearsome Guise		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Fearsome Guise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as disguise self. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Gift of Will		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Gift of Will			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.

Levitation Buffer		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Levitation Buffer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from hostile levitation. Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using %1 as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.|MesmeristLVL+CHA																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Linked Reaction		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Linked Reaction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whe either the subject or the mesmerist is surprise and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round.

Mask Misery			KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mask Misery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it.

This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions.

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +%1 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round.

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a +%1 morale bonus on the check, whichever results in a higher modifier.

Misdirection		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Misdirection			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dex bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Psychosomatic Surge	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Psychosomatic Surge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily.

Reflection of Weakness	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Reflection of Weakness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.	SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Shadow Splinter		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Shadow Splinter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by %1 (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.|3+CHA																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Spectral Smoke		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Spectral Smoke		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a %1-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for %2 round(s). The cloud functions as fog cloud, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.|min(10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5),30)|MesmeristLVL																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Vanish Arrow		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Vanish Arrow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.

The subject acts as thought the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by charm monster cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses.

That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square.

Spells				KEY:Occultist ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:An occultist casts psychic spells drawn from the occultist spell list presented on page 58, limited by the implement groups he knows. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every occultist spell has an implement component (see Implements on page 47). To learn or cast a spell, an occultist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an occultist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. An occultist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Occultist. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The occultist's selection of spells is limited. For each implement school he learns to use, he can add one spell of each level he can cast to his list of spells known, chosen from that school's spell list. If he selects the same implement school multiple times, he adds one spell of each level from that school's list for each time he has selected that school. When the occultist learns to cast a new level of spells, he immediately adds one spell of that level to his list of spells known from each implement school he knows (plus any extra spells from schools he has selected multiple times). At 5th level and every 3 occultist levels thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an occultist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the occultist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level occultist spell the occultist can cast. The spell learned must come from the same list of spells provided by the implement school of the spell lost. An occultist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level. An occultist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

Focus Powers			KEY:Occultist ~ Focus Powers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 1st level, an occultist learns the base focus power from both of his two implement schools (see Implements below) and can select one more focus power from the list of those available to him through those schools. Whenever the occultist learns a new implement school, he gains the base power of that school. In addition, at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, he learns a new focus power selected from the options granted by all of the implement schools he knows. The occultist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see Mental Focus on page 48). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. The occultist can't select a focus power more than once. Some focus powers require him to reach a specific occultist level before he can choose them.

Implements				KEY:Occultist ~ Implements				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 1st level, an occultist learns to use two implement schools. At 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the occultist learns to use one additional implement school, to a maximum of seven schools at 18th level. Each implement school adds one spell per spell level of that school of magic to the occultist's spell list. No spells from any other school are considered to be on the occultist's spell list until he selects the associated implement school. He can't use spell trigger or spell completion magic items from unknown schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. An occultist can select an implement school more than once in order to learn additional spells from the associated school. Each implement school is represented by a small list of objects. Every day, the occultist selects one item from that school's list to be his implement for the day for each implement school he knows. The occultist needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school, unless he selected that implement school multiple times, in which case he needs one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements don't need to be magic items, and nonmagical implements don't take up a magic item slot even if they're worn. Implements that are not magic items are often of some historical value or of personal significance to the occultist, such as the finger bone of a saint, the broken scepter of a long-dead king, the skull of a mentor's familiar, or the glass eye of an uncanny ancestor. Whenever an occultist casts a spell, he must have the corresponding implement in his possession and present the implement to the target or toward the area of effect. This act is part of casting the spell and doesn't require any additional action. If the occultist lacks the corresponding implement, he can attempt to cast the spell, but must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) to do so. Spells cast by an occultist without the appropriate implement are always treated as if they were cast at the minimum caster level for the spell in question (caster level 1st for a 1st-level spell, caster level 4th for a 2nd-level spell, and so on). Each implement school also grants a base focus power. This power is added to the list of focus powers possessed by the occultist (see Mental Focus below). In addition, each implement school grants access to a number of other focus powers that the occultist can select from using his mental focus class feature. See the Implement Schools section starting on page 50 for a complete list of implements associated with each school and their focus powers.

Knacks				KEY:Occultist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:An occultist learns one knack, or 0-level psychic spell, each time he selects an implement school (including when he again selects a school that he has already learned to use). These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks cast using any other spell slots because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Mental Focus			KEY:Occultist ~ Mental Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:An occultist can invest a portion of his mental focus into his chosen implements for the day, allowing him to utilize a variety of abilities depending on the implements and the amount of mental focus invested in them. An occultist has a number of points of mental focus equal to his occultist level + his Intelligence modifier; these points refresh each day. He can divide this mental focus between his implements in any way he desires. If an implement is lost or destroyed, the focus invested in it is lost as well, though the occultist still refreshes those points of focus normally. Once mental focus is invested inside an implement, the implement gains the resonant power of its implement school (see page 50), and the occultist can expend the mental focus stored in the implement to activate the associated focus powers he knows. If a resonant power grants a bonus that varies based on the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, the bonus is determined when the focus is invested, and is not reduced or altered by expending the mental focus invested in the item. Once all of the mental focus in an implement has been expended, it loses its resonant power until mental focus is once again invested in the implement. The implement grants its resonant power to whoever possesses it; the occultist can lend the implement to an ally to assist that ally, but if he does so, he has difficulty casting that implement's spells (see Implements on page 47) and can't expend that implement's focus on focus powers until he retrieves the implement or refreshes his focus. The occultist refreshes his mental focus once each day after receiving at least 8 hours of sleep. After refreshing his mental focus, the occultist must spend 1 hour preparing his implements and investing them with this power. Mental focus that is not used before the next time the occultist refreshes his focus is lost. The occultist can choose to save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it, but expending this focus comes at a higher cost. Any focus power the occultist activates with generic focus costs twice as much mental focus to use (and to maintain, if applicable). The occultist can expend his generic focus through an appropriate implement on any focus power he knows, but an implement he didn't invest any focus in at the start of the day grants no resonant power.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Magic Item Skill			KEY:Occultist ~ Magic Item Skill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																		DESC:At 2nd level, an occultist's knowledge of magic items grants him a bonus when attempting to use them. He gains a bonus on all Use Magic Device checks equal to 1/2 his occultist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Object Reading			KEY:Occultist ~ Object Reading			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 2nd level, an occultist learns how to read information from items he examines. Examining an item in this way requires him to spend 1 minute handling the item. If the item is a magic item, the occultist learns its properties and command word as if he had successfully examined the item using detect magic and succeeded at a Spellcraft check. This ability does not reveal whether the item is cursed unless the occultist's class level is equal to or greater than the caster level of the item. If the item has any historical significance, the occultist learns one piece of information about its past (as determined by the GM). Finally, if the item was last used no longer than 1 day ago per the occultist's class level, the occultist learns one piece of information about the last creature to use the item. This information might be a glimpse of the creature's appearance, a brief vision of what it saw while using the item, or perhaps its emotional state when it last used the item. The GM determines what information is gained in this way. This functions like the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), but doesn't require a skill check and can be used at will.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Shift Focus				KEY:Occultist ~ Shift Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 4th level, an occultist gains the ability to shift his mental focus from one implement to another, though some of the focus is lost along the way. Shifting mental focus removes a number of points of mental focus from one implement and adds the same number - 1 to another implement; this takes 1 minute of quiet contemplation while touching both implements. The occultist can shift his mental focus only from one implement to another implement; he can't shift generic focus into an implement. Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was taken. It does not, however, add to the resonant power of the implement to which the focus is added.

Aura Sight				KEY:Occultist ~ Aura Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 5th level, the occultist can read the auras of creatures around him as a standard action. This functions as the aura sightACG spell with a duration of 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Magic Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Magic Circles				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 8th level, an occultist learns how to draw magic circles. To draw a circle, he must have chalk, salt, blood, powdered silver, or some other appropriate substance at hand (although he can press a magic circle into a softer surface such as dirt or clay). Drawing a circle takes 1 minute and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of his implements). Once completed, this circle functions as a permanent magic circle against any alignment of the occultist's choosing. The circle can't be against a component of the occultist's alignment (if he is lawful good, for example, it can't be a magic circle against good or law). The circle remains until its form is physically broken (for example, if the lines are smeared or the salt is scattered). Only a living creature can break the circle; environmental effects can't break it. An occultist can have only one circle created in this way at a time. If he creates a second circle, the first one loses all its magic powers. This type of magic circle can't normally be focused inward to bind an outsider.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Outside Contact			KEY:Occultist ~ Outside Contact			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 8th level, the occultist learns the true name of one particular outsider. This outsider can have no more than 3 Hit Dice. Whenever the occultist creates a magic circle, he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the circle (similar to using lesser planar binding). The outsider is bound for up to 10 minutes. During this time, the occultist can bargain with the outsider for one piece of information. This requires a payment of at least 20 gp (or items of at least that value that are of interest to the outsider). The bargaining requires the occultist to attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the outsider's Sense Motive check. Succeeding at the check by 5 or more reduces this cost to 10 gp. Failure increases the price to 30 gp, whereas failure by 5 or more allows the outsider to escape without giving any information (or receiving payment). The information gained can be anything that might be learned through a divination spell. The information is always correct but is frequently cryptic. It typically takes the outsider 1d3 hours to gather the information, at which point it returns of its own accord to deliver the information as promised. The outsider always resents being used in this way, even if the occultist and the outsider share an alignment component. After the occultist bargains with the outsider, the magic circle loses all power and the outsider is sent back to its home plane. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the occultist learns to contact one additional outsider of the same type or a different type. Although he can call only one outsider in this way at a time, the occultist can ask such an outsider one additional question per calling for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 8th (to a maximum of four questions at 20th level), all for the same bargaining price. The questions must be in some way related to one another. At 16th level, in lieu of asking questions, the occultist can demand that the outsider deliver a message to any one friendly creature that the occultist knows personally. The occultist can also task the outsider to deliver one object weighing no more than 1 pound. Either of these demands requires an opposed check as described above. Delivery typically takes 1d4 hours, but this period is reduced to 1d6 minutes if the recipient is within 1 mile of the occultist (or even less if the recipient is within sight). The occultist must be able to accurately describe the recipient in both name and appearance. This ability can't be used to deliver anything to a location, or to enemies or creatures that are unfriendly to the occultist.	SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Binding Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Binding Circles			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 12th level, whenever the occultist creates a magic circle he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to make it a binding circle. A binding circle is invisible and counts as a trap. If a living creature of the corresponding alignment steps inside it, the trap triggers and binds the creature inside the circle. While it can move freely within the circle, it can't leave the circle, make attacks against targets outside the circle, cast spells that cross the circle's boundary (the circle blocks line of effect from the inside), or use any ability that would allow it to leave the circle or disturb the circle in any way. When the circle traps a creature in this way, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to dive out of the circle before the magic takes hold (DC = 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier). A creature that can see the circle gains a +4 bonus on this save. If it fails its save, the creature must remain in the circle, although it can attempt a Will save at the same DC at the end of each hour of imprisonment to escape. A binding circle can be spotted with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + 1/2 the occultist's level). It can also be disarmed using Disable Device, with the same DC. Anything crossing the boundary of the circle from the outside, such as a weapon, spell effect, or special ability, immediately breaks the circle and frees the creature trapped inside.																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Fast Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Fast Circles				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 16th level, the occultist learns to draw magic circles very quickly. He can draw a magic circle as a full-round action, but any circle drawn in this way has a duration of 1 minute per occultist level (unless it's drawn in conjunction with the outside contact class feature, in which case it lasts for 10 minutes as normal). If he draws a binding circle in this way, its duration is 1 round per occultist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.49
Implement Mastery			KEY:Occultist ~ Implement Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:At 20th level, an occultist learns to master one of his implements. He selects one implement school. Whenever he uses a focus power from an implement of that school, the DC to resist any of the effects increases by 4 and he treats his occultist level as 4 higher when determining the effects and duration of that power. In addition, the occultist gains 4 extra points of mental focus, but these points must always be invested in implements of the mastered school. He can't save these points or expend them for any ability other than the focus powers of those implements. The hardness of each of the occultist's implements of the mastered school increases by an additional 20 as long as the item has at least 1 point of mental focus stored within.

# Abjuration
Warding Talisman		KEY:Resonant Power ~ Warding Talisman				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Resonant Power.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The implement wards against adverse effects.

Mind Barrier		KEY:Base Focus Power ~ Mind Barrier				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Base Focus Power.Abjuration.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a shield of mental energy around you that protects you from harm. The shield prevents a total of 2 points of damage per occultist level you possess. It lasts until the start of your next turn or until exhausted. For example, if you are 5th level, the mind barrier protects you from 10 points of damage; if you are hit by an attack that would deal 12 points of damage, the mind barrier is exhausted and you take 2 points of damage. You can activate this ability as an immediate action, but doing so costs 2 points of mental focus instead of 1.

# Focus Powers - Abjuration
Aegis				KEY:Implement School Focus Power ~ Aegis				PREFACT:1,ABILITIES,OccultistSchool_Abjuration=true			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Implement School Focus Power.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a suit of armor or a shield to grant it an enhancement bonus. The bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a maximum bonus of +4 at 18th level). Enhancement bonuses gained via this ability stack with those of the armor or shield, to a maximum total enhancement bonus of +5. You can also imbue the armor or shield with any one armor or shield special ability that has an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to your maximum bonus granted by this ability by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (from the item itself or from aegis) to gain an armor or shield special ability. In either case, these bonuses last for 1 minute.
Energy Shield		KEY:Implement School Focus Power ~ Energy Shield			PREFACT:1,ABILITIES,OccultistSchool_Abjuration=true			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Implement School Focus Power.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself with a shield that protects you from energy damage. Whenever you take acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, the shield absorbs the damage (as protection from energy).

Its effect doesn’t stack with itself, with protection from energy, or with resist energy. You can activate the energy shield as an immediate action by expending 2 points of mental focus instead of 1. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.
Globe of Negation		KEY:Implement School Focus Power ~ Globe of Negation		PREFACT:1,ABILITIES,OccultistSchool_Abjuration=true			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Implement School Focus Power.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to create a stationary globe of negation. This globe is 10 feet in diameter and cancels any spell effect that is cast into or through its area. This functions as globe of invulnerability, but it affects spells of any level. The globe can negate a total number of spell levels equal to your occultist level, after which the globe collapses. Spells that exceed the number of remaining levels remove all remaining levels, but are weakened; any creatures targeted by such spells receive a +4 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against the spells’ effects. The globe lasts for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level. It has no effect on spells originating within the globe—only on those that enter its area as or after they are cast. You must be at least 11th level to select this focus power.

You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.

# Conjuration		
Casting Focus		KEY:Resonant Power ~ Casting Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Resonant Power.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The implement empowers the bearer’s ties to the worlds beyond, allowing his spells to maintain their power for a longer period of time. The bearer can add the implement as an additional focus component to any conjuration spell he casts that has a duration measured in rounds per level. If he does so, he adds 1 to his caster level for every 2 points of mental focus stored in the implement (to a maximum bonus equal to your occultist level). This increase applies only when determining the duration of the spell. Apply this increase after other effects that adjust a spell’s duration, such as Extend Spell.

DESC:You can expend 1 point of mental focus to conjure any item that qualif ies as an implement that you know how to use. This implement can be used as the item in question, functioning as a masterwork version of that item, and can also be used to cast your psychic spells, even though you did not select it at the beginning of the day.

The fissure begins in any square you designate and allows you to teleport to any other square you can see within 10 feet per occultist level.

If it has more Hit Dice than your occultist level, it is staggered for 1 round instead. The foe can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. Whether or not it succeeds at the save, the target is then immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting effect.

# Focus Powers - Enchantment
Binding Pattern		KEY:Implement School Focus Power ~ Binding Pattern		PREFACT:1,ABILITIES,OccultistSchool_Enchantment=true			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Implement School Focus Power.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a binding pattern of psychic energy that causes a living creature to become paralyzed.

If the creature is the same creature type as you, this power requires you to expend 1 point of mental focus; if it’s is not, you must expend 2 points instead. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. If it fails the saving throw, the creature treats you as an ally and doesn’t attempt to harm you (although your allies are not protected). You can call on the creature to aid you directly, but while doing so the creature can attempt a new Will save at the end of each round to end the effect. This effect otherwise lasts 1 round per occultist level you possess. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.

The target must be within 30 feet of you, and it can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it fails the save, the creature falls asleep, although it still perceives the world around it as a dream. This doesn’t cause the creature to fall prone, but it does drop whatever it is holding.

The creature remains asleep for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level or until it takes any amount of damage, which immediately wakes it. At the end of each of its turns, it receives another Will saving throw to end the effect.

Spells				KEY:Psychic ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A psychic casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class's spell list (see page 69). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a psychic's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier. A psychic can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-7: Psychic. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The psychic's selection of spells is limited. A psychic begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the psychic's choice. At each new psychic level, she learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-8: Psychic Spells Known. Unlike a psychic's spells per day, the number of spells a psychic knows isn't affected by her Intelligence score; the numbers on Table 1-8 are fixed. At 4th level and every even-numbered level thereafter (6th, 8th, and so on), a psychic can choose to learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the psychic loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell from the psychic's class list that the psychic can cast. A psychic can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. A psychic need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

Knacks				KEY:Psychic ~ Knacks						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Psychics learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-8. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they don't consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.

Phrenic Pool			KEY:Psychic ~ Phrenic Pool					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A psychic has a pool of supernatural mental energy that she can draw upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum number of points in a psychic's phrenic pool is %1. The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours don't need to be consecutive. The psychic might be able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional circumstances dictated by her psychic discipline. Points gained in excess of the pool's maximum are lost.|PhrenicPool																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BONUS:VAR|PhrenicPool|(PsychicLVL/2)+PhrenicPoolAbility	DEFINE:PhrenicPool|0	DEFINE:PhrenicPoolAbility|0
Phrenic Amplifications		KEY:Psychic ~ Phrenic Amplifications			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell's effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification's description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can't be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can't be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function.																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Phrenic Amplification|1+((PsychicLVL-1)/4)
Psychic Discipline (Ex or Sp)	KEY:Psychic ~ Psychic Discipline				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Each psychic accesses and improves her mental powers through a particular method, such as rigorous study or attaining a particular mental state. This is called her psychic discipline. She gains additional spells known based on her selected discipline. The choice of discipline must be made at 1st level; once made, it can't be changed. Each psychic discipline gives the psychic a number of discipline powers (at 1st, 5th, and 13th levels), and grants her additional spells known. In addition, the discipline determines which ability score the psychic uses for her phrenic pool and phrenic amplifications abilities. The DC of a saving throw against a psychic discipline ability equals 10 + 1/2 the psychic's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier. At 1st level, a psychic learns an additional spell determined by her discipline. She learns another additional spell at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, until learning the final one at 18th level. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1-8. Spells learned from a discipline can't be exchanged for different spells at higher levels. Specific psychic disciplines are further described starting on page 64.																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Psychic Discipline|1
Detect Thoughts			KEY:Psychic ~ Detect Thoughts					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 2nd level, a psychic can use detect thoughts as a spell-like ability once per day. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast detect thoughts. If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. When a psychic gains this ability, if she knows detect thoughts, she can learn a different 1st-level spell in place of detect thoughts, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Telepathic Bond			KEY:Psychic ~ Telepathic Bond					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 9th level, a psychic can use telepathic bond as a spell-like ability once per day, using her psychic level as her caster level. She can't leave herself out of a bond created in this way. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast telepathic bond. Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the psychic can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. For instance, if the psychic knows Extend Spell, she can use a 5th-level spell slot to cast extended telepathic bond as a full-round action. When a psychic who knows telepathic bond gains this ability, she can learn a different 4th-level spell in place of telepathic bond, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Major Amplifications		KEY:Psychic ~ Major Amplifications				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a psychic can choose one of the following major amplifications in place of a phrenic amplification.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Telepathy				KEY:Psychic ~ Telepathy						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 17th level, the psychic can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as both speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. When a psychic who knows telepathy (see page 189) gains this ability, she can learn a different 5th-level spell in place of telepathy, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Remade Self				KEY:Psychic ~ Remade Self					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 20th level, the psychic is affected by one of the following spells as a constant spell-like ability: arcane sight, fly, haste, heroism, nondetection, or tongues. This ability is chosen when the psychic reaches 20th level and can't be changed. While the psychic is under the effects of this spell-like ability, each time she casts a psychic spell, she can link one phrenic amplification or major amplification she knows that has a point cost of 1 to that spell without spending any points from her phrenic pool. This amplification is in addition to the normal maximum of one amplification per spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.64

# Phrenic Amplifications
Complex Countermeasure		KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Complex Countermeasure	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase by 2 the DCs of concentration checks or caster level checks the linked spell requires enemies to attempt. For example, if the linked spell were nondetection, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell's duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell's DCs by 4.																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Conjured Armor			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Conjured Armor		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the creature disappears, whichever comes first. This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or conjuration (summoning) spells. The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Defensive Prognostication	KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Defensive Prognostication	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell's level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Focused Force			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Focused Force			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When casting a force spell, the psychic can increase the spell's damage by spending 1 point from her phrenic pool. Increase the die size for the spell's damage by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can't be amplified in this way.																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Intense Focus			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Intense Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any concentration check she attempts as part of casting the linked spell. She can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Mindshield				KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Mindshield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per psychic level (maximum 10 rounds). The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can't grant different bonuses to different targets.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Mindtouch				KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Mindtouch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target's mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of detect thoughts). If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target's thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect.																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Ongoing Defense			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Ongoing Defense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can increase the duration of spells that improve her psychic defenses. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when she casts any intellect fortress, mental barrier, thought shield, or tower of iron will spell to extend the spell's duration by 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Overpowering Mind			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Overpowering Mind		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the Will save DC of the linked spell by 1. At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the DC by 2. At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the DC by 3. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Relentless Casting		KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Relentless Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Undercast Surge			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Undercast Surge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When the psychic undercasts a spell (see page 144), she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell's effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can't use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows mind thrust III but not mind thrust IV could cast mind thrust II and spend 2 points to treat it as mind thrust III, but couldn't spend 4 points to treat it as mind thrust IV. This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Will of the Dead			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Will of the Dead		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor. # Major Amplifications																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.62
# Major Amplifications
Dispelling Pulse			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Dispelling Pulse		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREVARGTEQ:PsychicLVL,11	DESC:The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted dispel magic spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Dual Amplification		KEY:Major Amplification ~ Dual Amplification		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	PREVARGTEQ:PsychicLVL,11	DESC:When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Mimic Metamagic			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Mimic Metamagic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	PREVARGTEQ:PsychicLVL,11	DESC:When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Space-rending Spell		KEY:Major Amplification ~ Space-rending Spell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREVARGTEQ:PsychicLVL,11	DESC:The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as dimension door). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Subordinate Spell			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Subordinate Spell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	PREVARGTEQ:PsychicLVL,11	DESC:The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level - 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Synaptic Shock			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Synaptic Shock			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREVARGTEQ:PsychicLVL,11	DESC:The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Turning Shield			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Turning Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREVARGTEQ:PsychicLVL,11	DESC:The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that deflects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of spell turning for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell.

Dark Half			KEY:Psychic Discipline Abomination ~ Dark Half			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By allowing the dark forces to overcome you, you can enter a state of instinctual cruelty as a swift action. While you're manifesting your dark half, you increase the DCs of your psychic spells by 1, gain a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and become immune to fear effects. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage while manifesting your dark half, you can cause one creature that took damage from the spell to also take 1 point of bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage increases to 2 points at 5th level and to 1d6 points at 13th level. While manifesting your dark half, you can't use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration other than casting spells using psychic magic, using phrenic amplifications, or attempting to return to normal. You can attempt to return to your normal self as a free action, but must succeed at a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level. If you fail, you continue to manifest your dark half and can't attempt to change back for 1 round. You can manifest your dark half for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + 1/2 your psychic level + your Charisma modifier; when these rounds are expended, you return to your normal self without requiring a concentration check.
Morphic Form		KEY:Psychic Discipline Abomination ~ Morphic Form		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Dream Leech		KEY:Psychic Discipline Dream ~ Dream Leech		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:While adjacent to a sleeping or unconscious creature, you can take a swift action to siphon that creature's dreams, thereby learning new things about your own mind. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect; such creatures are never considered willing. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect. If the subject fails the save, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the subject within the next 24 hours, and you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but no more than once per hour and no more than once per creature per day.
Oneiromancy		KEY:Psychic Discipline Dream ~ Oneiromancy		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, you can tamper with the minds of sleeping creatures. You plant a subconscious thought in a sleeping creature's mind by attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the sleeping creature's attitude or request a service from it. If you succeed, when the creature wakes it behaves in the way you dictated with the normal restrictions for the Diplomacy or Intimidate skill. The target of oneiromancy remains unaware of this manipulation, though if you fail your Diplomacy check the subject might have its starting attitude toward you negatively impacted, as normal. You must be adjacent to the sleeping creature to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this ability as part of the casting of dream, minor dreamARG, or nightmare. In this case, the oneiromancy effect takes place when the spell is cast. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect.
Mind Heist		KEY:Psychic Discipline Dream ~ Mind Heist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, you can delve into the subconscious mind of a sleeping target. You can cast detect thoughts as a spell-like ability on any adjacent sleeping creature. Additionally, you can gain the benefit of detect thoughts on a target of your dream, minor dreamARG, or nightmare spells as if you had studied the target for 3 rounds. If you cast dream scan (see page 166), you know whether you received false information from the dream. A successful Will save negates mind heist. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.
Waking Dream	KEY:Psychic Discipline Dream ~ Waking Dream		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, as a standard action, you can take control of the body of a sleeping creature within 30 feet for 1 hour per level. This ability functions like magic jar, except that your soul travels directly into the sleeping target with no receptacle necessary and the target creature's consciousness remains dreaming and unaware of its body's actions. When waking dream ends or the host body is destroyed, you immediately wake up in your body regardless of the distance from the host body, provided your body hasn't been destroyed. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect.

Deity						KEY:Psychic Discipline Faith ~ Deity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, choose a deity to worship. Your alignment must remain within one step of your deity's or you lose access to all this discipline's bonus spells and discipline powers.
Divine Energy				KEY:Psychic Discipline Faith ~ Divine Energy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:You can channel spell energy into cure or inf lict spells. This ability functions similarly to the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure or inf lict spells, and the type of spells you can convert depends on your alignment in the same way. The cure or inf lict spells don't count as being on your psychic spell list for the purposes of any other effects. Each day, you can convert up to one spell from each spell level you can cast. Each time you use this ability to convert a spell, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.
Resilience of the Faithful		KEY:Psychic Discipline Faith ~ Resilience of the Faithful	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, you gain a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels you possess beyond 5th.	BONUS:SAVE|ALL|2+floor((PsychicLVL-5)/5)
Prayer Aura					KEY:Psychic Discipline Faith ~ Prayer Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, as a free action, you can extend an aura around you to bolster your allies and make your enemies less effective. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day equal to your psychic level. These rounds don't need to be consecutive. This functions as the prayer spell, granting your allies a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks and imposing a 1 penalty on your enemies' rolls of those types. If you are chaotic, lawful, good, or evil, the penalty from your aura changes to 2 against creatures of an opposing alignment. The penalty doesn't change further for a creature that opposes you on two alignment axes (such as a chaotic evil creature fighting a lawful good psychic).

Illuminating Answers			KEY:Psychic Discipline Lore ~ Illuminating Answers		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:You can glean deeper truths from advice you magically obtain, even if the information itself is specious. When you use a spell or spell-like ability that allows you to get answers to questions (such as augury, blood biographyAPG, or contact other plane) and get at least one answer, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You regain this point even if the answer is false or vague. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.
Mnemonic Cache				KEY:Psychic Discipline Lore ~ Mnemonic Cache			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:You can memorize a piece of information and later recall it perfectly. Your mnemonic cache can hold roughly 10 pages of written information, including images and maps, or 30 minutes' worth of speech or music. (Memorizing music doesn't confer the ability to perform it properly.) The amount you can store increases by 5 pages and 5 minutes at 2nd level, and at every psychic level thereafter. You can hold only one piece of information in your mnemonic cache at a time. The information doesn't go away when you recall it, but when you put a new piece of information in the cache, the old piece becomes as imperfect any other memory. Memorizing magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) doesn't confer the ability to borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. You could reproduce the spell in writing to allow someone who prepares spells from a spellbook to prepare it, though this functions as using a borrowed spellbook for anyone other than you. If you're in telepathic contact with another creature (through telepathic bond, for example), you can transfer the information directly into its mind as a free action. For this creature, the information functions like a normal memory, not one with perfect clarity. You can attempt to sequester a written magical trap (such as explosive runes or sepia snake sigil) in your mnemonic cache and destroy it. Treat this as a Disable Device check to disarm a magical trap (as though you had the trapfinding class feature). Your bonus on this roll is equal to either your Disable Device modifier or the sum of 5 + your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, instead of being disabled, the trap is erased and destroyed. This ability can't destroy symbol traps; it functions only if written text is involved.
Superior Automatic Writing		KEY:Psychic Discipline Lore ~ Superior Automatic Writing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, when attempting checks for the automatic writing occult skill unlock (see page 194), you can treat your psychic level + your Wisdom bonus as your number of Linguistics skill ranks. At 8th level, you gain an additional option when using automatic writing, and can attempt a DC 35 check to gain information as though you'd used commune instead of augury or divination. This type of commune requires no material component, and the duration equals 1 round per psychic class level you possess. You connect to a distant being of great intellect, a fragment of the Akashic Record (see page 244), or a similar bastion of knowledge instead of to a deity.
Memory Palace				KEY:Psychic Discipline Lore ~ Memory Palace			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, you mentally construct an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing the volumes of lore you've studied. This ability functions as mage's magnificent mansion, with the following adjustments: the memory palace is limited in size to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your psychic level; your memory palace doesn't contain any furniture other than bookcases and a few desks and sofas where you and your visitors can study; and there is no food within, though the memory palace does contain a number of unseen servants equal to 1/2 your psychic level, which function solely as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you summon it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating. You can reshape the memory palace in your mind, so it doesn't need to currently be in effect for you to alter it. You can create your memory palace once per day. Choose one type of Knowledge skill when you gain this ability. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies withinincluding youa +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks of that type, and the memory palace counts as an extensive library for people attempting Knowledge checks of that type untrained. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks with the chosen skill when you're not consulting the palace (including when the palace isn't in effect). At 14th level and at each additional level thereafter, choose another Knowledge skill to which your memory palace's library bonuses apply.

DESC:As a swift action, you can cause an enemy to take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage if you dealt damage to that enemy with a spell since the start of your previous turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This damage increases to 2d6 at 8th level and to 3d6 at 15th level.

DESC:At 13th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature, you can also make that creature frightened or sickened (your choice) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. If you expend two uses of this ability, you can instead have the creature become dazed, nauseated, or panicked for 1 round. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting painUM effect.

Drug Resistance		KEY:Psychic Discipline Psychedelia ~ Drug Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When you ingest drugs, you take half as much ability damage (minimum 1). You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to avoid becoming addicted to a drug or to overcome being addicted (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 236).
Cognatogen			KEY:Psychic Discipline Psychedelia ~ Cognatogen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, you can create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. When you imbibe a cognatogen, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 1 minute per psychic level. In addition, while the cognatogen is in effect, you take a 2 penalty to one of your physical ability scores. If the cognatogen enhances your Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the alchemist's mutagen ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 28). When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. If you have both alchemist and psychic levels, these levels stack to determine the duration of your cognatogen and the DC of the save a non-alchemist must attempt if he drinks your cognatogen. If you gain discoveries, you can take the grand cognatogen and greater cognatogen discoveries to improve your cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens. However, even if you have alchemist levels, the duration of your cognatogen remains 1 minute per level (instead of 10 minutes per level) and you can still create only one per day (instead of an unlimited number) unless you also possess the cognatogen discovery.
Warped Brain		KEY:Psychic Discipline Psychedelia ~ Warped Brain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, your mind becomes difficult to comprehend. When another creature uses a mind-affecting spell or ability against you, that creature must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it becomes nauseated for 1 round. This ability triggers even if you succeed at your save (or are otherwise unaffected by the spell or ability), but doesn't apply if you're a willing subject of the spell. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Hallucinogenic Aura	KEY:Psychic Discipline Psychedelia ~ Hallucinogenic Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, a mental field emanates from you, touching the minds of those nearby. Any creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your hallucinogenic aura for 24 hours. A creature that fails its save doesn't need to continue making saves while it's confused by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends. This is a mind-affecting effect. You're immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from your aura. Brewing 1 dose requires 1 hour and a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. One dose's effects last for 1 month.

Emotional Bond		KEY:Psychic Discipline Rapport ~ Emotional Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:You can create an empathic link between yourself and your allies, allowing you to monitor their emotional states. Setting up the link requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted concentration from you and all subjects, who must remain within 10 feet of you. You can link with a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier. This bond lasts until the next time you regain your spells, or until you go unconscious or voluntarily end the bond as a free action. If the bond ends, you can establish a new bond at will with another 10 minutes of mutual concentration. This link allows you to monitor emotions, detecting when allies become angry, surprised, confused, fearful, or the like, but doesn't allow them to communicate specific details. You can also easily tell whether a subject is unconscious. If a subject dies or moves to a different plane than you, your bond with that creature is severed. The distance between you and the subjects doesn't affect the bond as long as you're on the same plane of existence. At 4th level, the bond also gives you the benefits of the status spell with all subjects of the emotional bond.
Emotional Push		KEY:Psychic Discipline Rapport ~ Emotional Push		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:You can draw upon the intense power of your own emotions in desperate situations, and your allies can call upon you through your emotional link to protect themselves. When you or a subject of your emotional bond must attempt a saving throw, the person attempting the save can gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on the save as an immediate action. This ability can be used once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 psychic levels you possess. Allies using this ability don't need your permission, since the emotional connection is so direct, though you know when one of the uses has been expended. If the ally's saving throw is successful, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.

Bodily Purge	KEY:Psychic Discipline Self-Perfection ~ Bodily Purge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:You can heal your own wounds and maladies with the power of thought alone. At 5th level, you gain access to a daily pool of healing energy. This pool starts with 3 d8 dice per day, and gains 1 additional d8 for every 2 psychic levels you possess beyond 5th. As a standard action, you can use up any number of these dice to regain a number of hit points equal to the result of rolling that many d8s. For example, at 5th level you could regain 3d8 hit points all at once, 1d8 hit points three separate times, or 1d8 hit points once and 2d8 hit points at a different time. In addition, you can expend 2 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of lesser restoration (affecting yourself only). At 7th level, you can expend 3 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of neutralize poison, remove disease, or restoration (affecting yourself only). To use restoration to dispel a permanent negative level, you must expend 4 dice from this pool instead of 3. Use your psychic level as your caster level for these effects.

Spells						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A spiritualist casts psychic spells drawn from the spiritualist spell list (see page 76). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. To learn or cast a spell, a spiritualist must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a spiritualist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the spiritualist's Wisdom modifier. A spiritualist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-9: Spiritualist. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). A spiritualist's selection of spells is limited. A spiritualist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the spiritualist's choice. At each new spiritualist level, she learns one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1-10: Spiritualist Spells Known. Unlike her number of spells per day, the number of spells a spiritualist knows does not affect her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table 1-10 are fixed. Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third spiritualist level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a spiritualist can learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the spiritualist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spiritualist spell she can cast. A spiritualist can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Knacks						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A spiritualist learns a number of knacks, or 0-level psychic spells, as noted on Table 1-10 under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks prepared using another spell slot, because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Phantom						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Phantom					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:PhantomMasterLVL|0	DESC:A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness (see the shared consciousness class feature on page 73), manifest it partially (see the bonded manifestation class feature on page 74), or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom's manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist's consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours. While fully manifested, a phantom can't be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist's consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can't be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist's consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist's psyche. Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist's consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future. Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation; see Bonded Manifestation on page 74) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom's master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist's consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed. A fully manifested phantom's abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist's class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.

Shared Consciousness				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Shared Consciousness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 1st level, while a phantom is confined in a spiritualist's consciousness (but not while it's fully manifested or banished to the Ethereal Plane), it grants the spiritualist the Skill Focus feat in two skills determined by the phantom's emotional focus, unless the spiritualist already has Skill Focus in those skills. It also grants a +4 bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +8. Lastly, once per day, when the spiritualist fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, as an immediate action she can shunt that effect into the phantom's section of her consciousness instead. When she does so, she is not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, the spiritualist loses the bonuses on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and the Skill Focus effects granted by her phantom, and can't use this ability to shunt a mind-affecting effect into the phantom's consciousness or manifest her phantom in any way. When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the phantom's consciousness, spells such as dispel magic and break enchantment can be cast on the spiritualist to end the effect's duration as if the spiritualist were affected by the mind-affecting effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Etheric Tether					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Etheric Tether				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 1st level, a spiritualist can force the phantom to manifest in an area around her by pushing the phantom's consciousness though the veil of ethereal essence, allowing it to fully manifest in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. Whenever her manifested phantom takes enough damage to send it back to the Ethereal Plane, as a reaction to the damage, the spiritualist can sacrifice any number of her hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the phantom. This can prevent the phantom from being sent back to the Ethereal Plane. This tether is limited. When the phantom is fully manifested, it and the spiritualist must remain within 50 feet of one another for the phantom's manifestation to stay stable with little to no concentration on the part of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can stretch the limited tether, but only when the phantom is in ectoplasmic form. When a spiritualist starts her turn and her ectoplasmic phantom is more than 50 feet away from her (but closer than 100 feet), the spiritualist must concentrate on the link as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or the ectoplasmic phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and cannot be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. This concentration can be interrupted as if it were a spell. Treat this effect's spell level as equal to 1 + 1 per 10 feet farther than 50 feet that the phantom is from the spiritualist (maximum spell level 6th). If the tether is interrupted or the check fails, the phantom immediately snaps back into the consciousness of its spiritualist master. If the ectoplasmic phantom is ever more than 100 feet away from its spiritualist, or the incorporeal phantom is ever 50 feet away from the spiritualist or outside of line of effect from the spiritualist for more than 1 round per spiritualist level the spiritualist possesses, the tether is automatically broken; the phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and can't be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Bonded Senses					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Bonded Senses				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 2nd level, as a standard action, a spiritualist can share the senses of her manifested phantom, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling everything her phantom does. She can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level, but those rounds do not need to be consecutive. There is no maximum range for this effect, but the phantom and the spiritualist must be on the same plane. The spiritualist can end this effect as a free action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Bonded Manifestation				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Bonded Manifestation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 3rd level, as a swift action, a spiritualist can pull on the consciousness of her phantom and the substance of the Ethereal Plane to partially manifest aspects of both in her own body. When she does, she uses this bonded manifestation to enhance her own abilities while the phantom is still bound to her consciousness. For the spiritualist to use this ability, the phantom must be confined in the spiritualist's consciousness; it can't be manifested in any other way. During a bonded manifestation, the phantom can't be damaged, dismissed, or banished. A spiritualist can use bonded manifestation a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her spiritualist level. The rounds need not be consecutive. She can dismiss the effects of a bonded manifestation as a free action, but even if she dismisses a bonded manifestation on the same round that she used it, it counts as 1 round of use. When a spiritualist uses this ability, she must choose either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. When she makes this choice, she gains all of the abilities based on the form she chooses and her spiritualist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation		KEY:Spiritualist ~ Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses ectoplasmic form, she gains an ectoplasmic shield that protects her without restricting her movement or actions. She gains a +4 shield bonus to Armor Class; this bonus applies to incorporeal touch attacks. The ectoplasmic shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. At 8th level, the spiritualist also sprouts a pair of ectoplasmic tendrils from her body. Once per round as either a swift or a standard action (spiritualist's choice), the spiritualist can use one or both tendrils to attack creatures within her melee reach (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom) or to manipulate objects. She can even use that action to have one tendril make an attack and the other manipulate an object, as long as that object can be manipulated with one hand. At 13th level, the phantom's ectoplasm clings to the spiritualist like a suit of armor. This grants the spiritualist a +6 armor bonus to AC without imposing an armor check penalty, an arcane spell failure chance, or any reduction in speed. At 18th level, the spiritualist can take a full-round action to attack all creatures within her melee reach with her tendrils (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom). When she does, she rolls the attack roll twice, takes the better of the two results, and uses that as her attack roll result against all creatures within her melee reach. If the better attack roll threatens a critical hit, the spiritualist chooses one target that she hit to confirm the critical hit against. The other attacks that hit are considered normal hits rather than critical threats. Incorporeal Bonded Manifestation: When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal form, she becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment against ranged attacks. At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal creatures with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are treated as if they had the ghost touch magic weapon special ability. At 13th level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become invisible (as the invisibility spell) until the start of her next turn. At 18th level, the spiritualist gains the incorporeal subtype and a fly speed of 30 feet (good) while using this form of bonded manifestation. Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su): At 4th level, whenever a spiritualist is within the reach of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +2 shield bonus to her Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws. She doesn't gain these bonuses when the ectoplasmic manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. A spiritualist within 30 feet of her incorporeally manifested phantom receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mindaffecting effects. This bonus is a supernatural ability and does not apply if the phantom is unconscious.

Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su)		KEY:Spiritualist ~ Spiritual Interference			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 4th level, whenever a spiritualist is within reach of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +2 shield bonus to her Armor Class ad a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws. She doesn't gain these bonuses when the ectoplasmic manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. A spiritualist within 30 feet of her incorporeally manifested phantom receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. This bonus is a supernatural ability and does not apply if the phantom is unconscious.

Detect Undead					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Detect Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike						DESC:At 5th level, a spiritualist's connection with the Ethereal Plane becomes so strong that she can use detect undead at will as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her spiritualist level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Phantom Recall					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Phantom Recall				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 6th level, as either a swift or an immediate action, a spiritualist can call her manifested phantom to her side or back into her consciousness. This ability functions as dimension door, using the spiritualist's class level as the caster level. When the spiritualist calls the phantom in this way, the phantom appears adjacent to the spiritualist (or as close as possible, if all adjacent spaces are occupied). When the spiritualist uses this ability to call the phantom back to her consciousness, she can activate bonded manifestation as part of that action, but doing so costs 1 extra round of bonded manifestation. The spiritualist can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond 6th.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Calm Spirit						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Calm Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike						DESC:At 7th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use calm spirit (see page 160) as a spell-like ability once per day. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the spiritualist can use this ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of 4 times per day at 19th level).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.76
See Invisibility					KEY:Spiritualist ~ See Invisibility				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike						DESC:At 9th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to see many things normally hidden from sight. She gains the ability to use see invisibility as a spell-like ability once per day, with a duration of 10 minutes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Fused Consciousness				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Fused Consciousness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 10th level, a spiritualist always gains the benefits of bonded senses when her phantom is manifested. She also gains the skill ranks and bonus to mind-affecting spells granted by the spirit's emotional focus (see page 80), even when her phantom is manifested. Lastly, she can shunt the effect of a mind-affecting effect into the consciousness of her phantom as the shared consciousness ability even when the phantom is manifested, but doing so causes the phantom to immediately retreat back into the spiritualist's consciousness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Greater Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su)	KEY:Spiritualist ~ Greater Spiritual Interference	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 12th level, whenever allies are within the phantom's reach, as long as the manifested phantom is in ectoplasmic form, each ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. For the spiritualist, these bonuses increase to +4. The spiritualist and allies within range don't gain this bonus if the manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. While the phantom is incorporeally manifested, allies within 30 feet of the phantom receive a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. For the spiritualist, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus doesn't apply if the phantom is unconscious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Spiritual Bond					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Spiritual Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:At 14th level, a spiritualist's life force becomes intrinsically linked with the phantom's spiritual essence. As long as the phantom has 1 or more hit points, when the spiritualist takes damage that would reduce her to fewer than 0 hit points, those points of damage are transferred to the phantom instead. This transfer stops after the phantom takes all the points of damage or the phantom is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to its Constitution score. In the latter case, points of damage dealt in excess of this limit are dealt to the spiritualist. This ability affects only effects that deal hit point damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Call Spirit						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Call Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike						DESC:At 16th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use call spirit (see page 160) as a spell-like ability once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.76

# Blood Kineticist
Blood Focus							KEY:Blood Kineticist ~ Blood Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blood Kineticist Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A blood kineticist must choose water as her primary element and must choose water blast as her first simple blast. All of her infusions granted by this archetype work only on targets with blood and automatically fail if the target is immune to bleed damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Wrack								KEY:Blood Kineticist ~ Wrack				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blood Kineticist Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a blood kineticist can use her abilities to wrack a target within 30 feet, harming the target by manipulating its blood from the inside. The target takes half the normal damage of the blood kineticist's blast, and can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce that amount to 1/4 normal damage, but the damage is untyped and ignores damage reduction. This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Bleeding Infusion						KEY:Blood Kineticist ~ Bleeding Infusion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blood Kineticist Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, a blood kineticist can infuse her blasts with a vicious power that causes internal or external bleeding. On a failed Fortitude save, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every die of the blast's damage. A target that fails its saving throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving throw to avoid the bleed damage from bleeding infusion on the same blast. This is a 2nd-level substance infusion that costs 2 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.

This works as blood biographyAPG, except the blood kineticist suddenly knows the information, rather than having it appear on a parchment. This is a 3rd-level utility wild talent and costs 0 points of burn. She can accept 1 point of burn to reduce the casting time to a standard action instead of 1 minute. This ability replaces the 6th-level utility wild talent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Blood Blast							KEY:Blood Kineticist ~ Blood Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blood Kineticist Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The first time a blood kineticist selects water with expanded element, she doesn't gain the cold simple blast or the ice composite blast; instead, she gains the blood composite blast, which costs 2 points of burn. A blood blast is a physical blast that deals bludgeoning damage. It is associated with the same infusions as the water blast. If the blood kineticist selects water with expanded element a second time, she gains the cold simple blast and ice composite blast as normal. This ability alters expanded element.

Blood Throw							KEY:Blood Kineticist ~ Blood Throw			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blood Kineticist Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, a blood kineticist gains the foe throw infusion as a bonus infusion, and can use it with the water element on water and blood blasts, in addition to its normal associated element and blast.

On a failed Fortitude save, the target is sickened for 1 minute. A target that fails its saving throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving throw to avoid the sickened condition from gutwrenching infusion on the same blast. This is a 4th-level substance infusion that costs 3 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts.

Vampiric Infusion						KEY:Blood Kineticist ~ Vampiric Infusion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blood Kineticist Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, a blood kineticist can drain the vitality from her enemy's blood to restore her own. If her blast hits (or the enemy fails its saving throw against a blast without an attack roll) the blood kineticist can activate the kinetic healer utility wild talent on herself by accepting its burn cost; she doesn't need to take an action to do so. If she doesn't possess the kinetic healer utility wild talent, she can still use this ability, but it heals only half as much. This is a 5th-level substance infusion that costs 3 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 11th-level infusion.

Blood Mastery						KEY:Blood Kineticist ~ Blood Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blood Kineticist Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[Not Implemented] At 20th level, a blood kineticist no longer ages and can't be magically aged. She doesn't take penalties to her ability scores for aging and removes any such penalties she already possesses. She still accrues age bonuses as normal, but she doesn't die of old age when her time would be up. Because of her utter control over her own blood, she is immune to bleed, injected poisons, injury diseases, and the sickened and nauseated conditions unless she chooses to be affected.

# Elemental Annihilator
Devastating Infusion					KEY:Elemental Annihilator ~ Devastating Infusion					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Elemental Annihilator Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, an elemental annihilator can either shoot her kinetic blast at a target within 30 feet or make a single melee attack as if she were using kinetic blade as an attack action. For this attack, the elemental annihilator's base attack bonus from her kineticist levels is equal to her full kineticist level. A devastating infusion always deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + the elemental annihilator's Constitution modifier, regardless of the annihilator's class level or use of composite blasts. When making a melee attack with devastating infusion, the elemental annihilator doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and if she uses two hands, the attack's damage is equal to 1d8 + 1-1/2 times her Constitution modifier. This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn and can be used with any physical blast (but not energy blasts). Unlike with kinetic blade, the elemental annihilator can use Vital Strike with devastating infusion. The damage bonus from elemental overflow doesn't apply to devastating infusion's damage rolls. This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion and the basic utility wild talent normally granted by selecting an element.

Rapid Shot and Two-Weapon Fighting can be used with a kinetic blast only if the annihilator also possesses flurry of devastation (see below). She gains an additional bonus feat at 8th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels. At 8th level, she can also select Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Weapon Specialization. At 10th level, she can also select Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Critical, Improved Precise Shot, and Two-Weapon Rend. An elemental annihilator doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for these feats to select them as bonus feats.

If anyone provokes an attack of opportunity from her, she can form her melee devastating infusion and make the attack, after which the weapon disappears.

Blast Training						KEY:Elemental Annihilator ~ Blast Training						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Elemental Annihilator Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 5th level, an elemental annihilator gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with her devastating infusion form infusion. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Flurry of Devastation					KEY:Elemental Annihilator ~ Flurry of Devastation					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Elemental Annihilator Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 6th level, an elemental annihilator can make a full attack of devastating infusions against targets within 120 feet as a full-attack action. Each individual attack deals damage as a devastating infusion. This is a 3rd-level form infusion that costs 1 point of burn and can be used with the same blast types as devastating infusion. Abilities such as Rapid Shot and haste that grant additional attacks apply normally to this full attack. If she makes only melee attacks with her flurry of devastation, she can use the Two-Weapon Fighting feats (unlike with the kinetic blade wild talent), but ranged devastating infusions do not work with Two-Weapon Fighting. For the elemental annihilator's off-hand attacks with Two-Weapon Fighting, she adds half her Constitution modifier to the damage (increasing to her full Constitution modifier if she has Double Slice). Though she can normally mix melee and ranged attacks with her flurry of devastation, she can't do so when she uses Two-Weapon Fighting. She can never use metakinesis or substance infusions with flurry of devastation. This ability replaces the 6th-, 12th-, and 16thlevel utility wild talents.

Omnicide deals 10d6+10 points of bludgeoning damage, 10d6+10 points of cold damage, 10d6+10 points of electricity damage, 10d6+10 points of fire damage, and 10d6+10 points of force damage, and counts as a blast of all five elements. Omnicide costs 4 points of burn, which can be reduced by composite specialization as normal.

He gains the kinetic fist form infusion and it costs 0 points of burn instead of 1 point of burn. When using the kinetic fist form infusion with a full attack, he can make a flurry of blows as the monk class feature. He must use only his fists to make this flurry, no matter what other abilities he possesses. Like a monk, he can use this ability only when unarmored, not using a shield, and unencumbered. He can't use his kinetic blast without a form infusion, nor can he ever use his kinetic blast with the chain, extended range, extreme range, foe throw, flurry of blasts, many throw, or snake form infusions, or with any other form infusion that requires a ranged attack roll or ranged touch attack roll.

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the elemental ascetic is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels the elemental ascetic possesses beyond 2nd.

At 9th level, he can instead accept 3 additional points of burn to increase the damage dice from d6s to d10s. At 13th level, he can instead accept 4 additional points of burn to increase the damage dice from d6s to d12s.

At 5th level, she can choose to roll one additional die when using kinetic healer. This increases to two additional dice at 11th level, and to three additional dice at 17th level. At 9th level, she can choose to bring an ally who died within 1 round back from the dead; this functions similarly to the breath of life spell. The ally regains the normal number of hit points from kinetic healer. An ally revived in this way takes 1 additional point of burn, beyond the normal 1 point of burn that either the kinetic chirurgeon or the ally must accept as a cost of the kinetic healer wild talent. At 13th level, a kinetic chirurgeon can choose to use kinetic healer on herself as a swift action. At 17th level, she can choose to heal both herself and another target with the same use of kinetic healer, although in that case, both she and her target must each accept 1 point of burn, instead of only one of them needing to do so as normal for kinetic healer. Regardless of her level, the kinetic chirurgeon can apply only one metahealer ability to a single use of kinetic healer. For instance, she could not bring back a dead ally and also roll extra dice for healing.

Mental Prowess						KEY:Overwhelming Soul ~ Mental Prowess					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Overwhelming Soul Class Feature.Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:An overwhelming soul's mind is strong enough to protect her body from the stress of channeling the elements. However, in exchange, she is unable to push her limits quite as far as other kineticists. She can't choose to accept burn, though she can use wild talents with a burn cost if she can reduce that cost to 0 points with abilities such as gather power and infusion specialization. If she would be forced to accept burn against her will (for example, if she fails a concentration check), instead of taking burn she takes 1 temporary negative level, which never kills her and can't be removed with restoration or greater restoration, but which disappears automatically after 24 hours. At 6th level, once per day, she can reduce the total burn cost of any wild talent by 1. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability alters burn and replaces internal buffer.

The damage bonus doesn't apply to kinetic blade, kinetic whip, or other infusions that don't apply the damage bonus from elemental overflow. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. This ability replaces elemental overflow.

Ofuda					KEY:Kami Medium ~ Ofuda						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																					DESC:A kami medium uses ofudas-psychically charged prayer scrolls-to focus his spells. Each of his spells gains an ofuda as an additional inexpensive material component, and the ofuda replaces the divine focus for spells the kami medium gains via the divine surge spirit power. Unless the spell involves a touch attack or ranged touch attack, the kami medium doesn't need to attempt an attack roll to place an ofuda on an unwilling target; the ofuda simply appears on affected targets. For instantaneous spells, the ofuda is consumed during the casting, but for spells with any other duration, the ofuda remains on the target or targets throughout the duration and then disintegrates when the duration expires. A kami medium's spells can't be dispelled by dispel magic or greater dispel magic, but removing or destroying the ofuda ends the duration immediately. An ofuda must be displayed prominently and can't be hidden (though a creature bearing an ofuda can hide normally). A successful steal or grapple combat maneuver check to remove an item is sufficient to remove an ofuda from an unwilling target, and a standard action automatically removes it from a willing target. An ofuda counts as an object made of paper with %1 hit points. The target of the spell can't see, harm, or remove the ofuda attached to her, though her allies can do so. If the spell is harmless, the target can see her ofuda.|5*MediumLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.92

Panoply Bond						KEY:Battle Host ~ Panoply Bond							CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Battle Host Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a battle host forms a supernatural bond with a specif ic weapon, suit of armor, or shield. This selection is permanent and can never be changed. The bonded item is masterwork quality and the battle host begins play with it at no cost. The bonded item is immune to the broken condition for as long as the battle host lives. If a battle host dies and is restored to life, the bonded item is also restored if it was destroyed. Any magic powers associated with a battle host's bonded item function only for the battle host; in the hands of anyone else it is only a masterwork item. The bonded item starts as an implement for any single school of magic at 1st level, and gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the battle host access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The battle host's bonded item serves as his implement component to cast occultist spells of all the schools that he knows. However, he must split his mental focus among the schools he knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though he possesses only one physical item as an implement. This ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.

Spirit Warrior						KEY:Battle Host ~ Spirit Warrior							CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Battle Host Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 5th level, a battle host can call forth the spirit of a dead warrior who once owned his bonded item. Calling the spirit is a standard action, and unlike the use of most spell-like abilities, it doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability functions as spiritual ally (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 246), using the battle host's occultist level as his caster level and his Intelligence modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier to determine the spell's effects. The battle host can summon a spirit warrior once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 5th.

As a swift action, a battle host can grant himself a +4 insight bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for 1 minute. The battle host can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 6th. If he activates heroic splendor again before the duration expires, the new use of heroic splendor replaces the old use.

# Necroccultist
Necromantic Bond						KEY:Necroccultist ~ Necromantic Bond					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Necroccultist Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[not enforced]At 1st level, a necroccultist gains access to only the necromancy school of implements. He must select necromancy for his implement mastery. Each time he gains an occultist level, a necroccultist can add one necromancy spell from the wizard spell list to his occultist spell list and his list of spells known. The necroccultist can't choose a spell of a higher level than he is able to cast, and he adds the spell at the same spell level it appears on the wizard spell list. At 14th level, he doesn't gain an additional school of implements. Instead, at 14th level, the DCs of saving throws to resist a necroccultist's necromancy spells and necromancy focus powers increase by 2. This ability alters implements and implement mastery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.100
Deadspeaker							KEY:Necroccultist ~ Deadspeaker						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Necroccultist Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a necroccultist can learn the answers to a specific set of questions concerning a dead or undead creature. The necroccultist must consume at least one drop of the creature's blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as blood biography (Advanced Player's Guide 206), using the necroccultist's occultist level as his caster level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every 2 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces object reading.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.101
Ghostly Horde						KEY:Necroccultist ~ Ghostly Horde						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Necroccultist Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, a necroccultist can spend 1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to summon a mob of ghostly spirits to harass his enemies. Summoning the ghostly horde is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The ghostly horde appears within 60 feet of the necroccultist, fills an area 20 feet in diameter, and always hovers a few inches off the ground (thus ignoring any difficult terrain). The necroccultist can command the ghostly horde to move up to 30 feet each round as a move action, though the farthest edge of the ghostly horde can never be more than 60 feet from the necroccultist. Any creature caught inside the ghostly horde takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 occultist levels at the start of its turn (up to a maximum of 10d6 points of damage at 20th level). A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the necroccultist's occultist level + the necroccultist's Intelligence modifier) halves this damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches as if from supernatural aging. Nonliving creatures and creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. The ghostly horde remains for 1 round, though at the beginning of his turn, the necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus as a swift action to extend the duration for 1 additional round. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 5 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces aura sight.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.101
Life Drain							KEY:Necroccultist ~ Life Drain						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Necroccultist Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 8th level, a necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to unleash a life-draining ray as a ranged touch attack that causes the target to accrue 1d4 negative levels. The ray has a range of 60 feet. The negative levels last a number of minutes equal to the necroccultist's occultist level. For each negative level this attack gives a target, the necroccultist regains a number of hit points equal to his occultist level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces outside contact.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.101

# Sha'ir
Jin								KEY:Sha'ir ~ Jin								CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Sha'ir Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[not implemented]At 1st level, a sha'ir learns how to contact a jin-a minor, insubstantial genie that makes its home on the elemental planes. She learns how to contact a second jin at 6th level and a third jin at 14th level. Each of these jin is connected to one of the eight schools of magic, just like an occultist implement, but also to the air, earth, fire, or water school (Advanced Player's Guide 142). Each jin works like a living implement for both of its schools. To provide the implement component for a spell or focus power, a jin must be within 30 feet of its master. The elemental schools don't have focus powers or resonant powers. Instead, the sha'ir considers all wizard spells of 6th level and lower from the lists corresponding to her jin's elemental schools to be on her occultist spell list. In addition, she adds additional spells to her list of spells known. For every spell level she can cast, she adds one spell from each jin's elemental school and one spell from each jin's non-elemental school. A jin in its natural form has the base statistics of a Small elemental of the chosen type with the young simple template and without the air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, or whirlwind abilities. At 20th level, a sha'ir selects one of her jin and chooses one of its two schools instead of selecting an implement for implement mastery. If one of her jin is slain, the sha'ir is treated as if she didn't have the appropriate implement to cast the spells associated with that jin. The sha'ir can replace the slain jin the following morning by expending 1 point of mental focus in a special ritual that takes 1 hour to perform. This ability replaces implements and alters mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Augment Jin (Sp/Su)					KEY:Sha'ir ~ Augment Jin					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Sha'ir Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:[not implemented]Starting at 2nd level, a sha'ir's jin uses its master's base saving throws if they are better than its own, and it uses either its own hit point total or 1/2 its master's hit points, whichever is higher. At 4th level, a sha'ir can concentrate for 1 full round and expend 1 point of mental focus stored in a jin to grant that jin all the statistics of a Small elemental of its type for 1 round per occultist level (this includes gaining any of the following abilities, if applicable: air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, and whirlwind). At 8th level, she can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to give one of her jin all the statistics of a Medium elemental. At 10th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Medium elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus, and the sha'ir can give a jin all the statistics of a Large elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 12th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Large elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 14th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a greater elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 16th level, the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of an elder elemental for 3 points of mental focus. This ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Manifest Jin						KEY:Sha'ir ~ Manifest Jin						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Sha'ir Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 7th level, the sha'ir can designate one of her jin and manifest its powers, allowing it to count as a Small elemental at all times, as if using augment jin to augment it to a Small elemental but with a permanent duration. By concentrating for 1 full round, she can change which of her jin she manifests in this way. This ability replaces aura sight.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Jin Spy							KEY:Sha'ir ~ Jin Spy							CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Sha'ir Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, when a sha'ir gains her outside contact ability, instead of learning the true names of outsiders, she can ask one or more of her jin to perform tasks. She chooses from the same tasks listed under outside contact (as appropriate to her occultist level). This doesn't require negotiation or gifts, but the jin is not available to the sha'ir during the time it spends performing these tasks. This ability alters outside contact.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.102

# Tome Eater
Bonded Tome							KEY:Tome Eater ~ Bonded Tome					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Tome Eater Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[not implemented]At 1st level, a tome eater forms a supernatural bond with a specific book. She can replace her bonded tome with another book at any time, though the tome eater must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune herself to the new book. The bonded tome starts as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level, and it gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the tome eater access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The tome eater's bonded tome serves as her implement component to cast occultist spells of all schools she knows. However, she must split her mental focus among the schools she knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though she possesses only one physical item as an implement. Once per day as part of casting an occultist spell, a tome eater can expend 1 point of mental focus tied to the appropriate school to increase the spell's caster level by 1 or increase the spell's DC by 1. A tome eater can enhance a spell in this manner one additional time per day at 6th level, and another time per day for every 5 occultist levels she possesses beyond 6th. This ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Devour Books and Scrolls				KEY:Tome Eater ~ Devour Books and Scrolls			CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Tome Eater Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:A tome eater can devour books and scrolls in order to gain various benefits. Devouring a book or scroll is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A devoured book or scroll is absorbed into the tome eater's body and completely destroyed. At 4th level, once per day a tome eater can devour a spell scroll or a book to regain mental focus, which she can divide as she likes among her schools of magic, to a maximum of the amount of mental focus she assigned to that school at the beginning of the day. If she devours a scroll, a tome eater regains a number of points of mental focus equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell contained on the scroll. If she devours a nonmagical book that contains at least 100 pages of written text and is worth at least 25 gp, a tome eater regains 1 point of mental focus. If she devours a magical book, she regains a number of points of mental focus equal to half the caster level of the item. If the tome eater devours a spellbook with at least 50 pages of spells of 1st level or higher, she regains 4 points of mental focus. At 6th level, a tome eater can ready an action to devour an enemy's spell when an enemy within 30 feet attempts to cast a spell from a scroll. This ability works as the counterspell action as if the tome eater were using dispel magic, though the tome eater doesn't need to cast a spell to counter the enemy's spell. A tome eater can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels beyond 6th. If a tome eater readies an action to use this ability and the readied action never triggers, she doesn't expend a daily use of this ability. At 16th level, the tome eater can use this ability as an immediate action without readying an action. At 8th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a standard action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can devour the enemy's scroll without spending any additional actions if she hasn't devoured a scroll or book yet that day. At 12th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a move action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can choose to turn the spell back on its caster (as spell turning) instead of devouring the scroll. She can do this whether or not she has devoured a scroll or book yet that day. This ability replaces shift focus, the implement gained at 6th level, magic circles, outside contact, binding circles, and fast circles.																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.103
Word Sense (Sp/Su)					KEY:Tome Eater ~ Word Sense					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Tome Eater Class Feature.Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 5th level, a tome eater is constantly under the effect of read magic. Additionally, she can automatically detect the general topic of a piece of writing, and whether that writing is a magical scroll or tome, simply by looking at it. If she spends 1 round concentrating on a text within 30 feet per 100 pages of the text, she can gain a sense of a text's contents as if she had skimmed the text. This ability replaces aura sight.

She isn't prevented from remembering things that happen over the course of a game, but might be forgetful.

An amnesiac's faulty memory makes remembering and casting spells difficult, but the increased flexibility can be a great benefit. Instead of choosing a number of spells known from Table 1-8: Psychic Spells Known, an amnesiac accesses spells she knew the previous day from the recesses of her mind. This requires 1 hour of meditation. Each day, for each spell level the amnesiac can cast, she retains a number of spells known equal to half the number listed on Table 1-8, rounded up. These spells must be selected from spells the amnesiac knew the previous day (including any spells she remembered using spell recollection; see below). The remainder of her spells known (half the number on Table 1-8, rounded down) become amnesia slots, which the amnesiac can use with her spell recollection ability (see below). To determine the spells she knows on the day when she first takes this archetype, the amnesiac picks any one 1st-level spell from the psychic spell list. This change to spells doesn't apply to knacks (0-level spells) or discipline spells, which function the same way they do for a normal psychic. When the amnesiac gains access to 3rd-level spells, she gains full recall of her 1st-level spells and no longer gains 1st-level amnesia slots, instead gaining the full number of 1st-level spells known from Table 1-8 and casting them as a normal psychic. When this happens, the amnesiac can select any level-appropriate spells from the psychic spell list as her spells known, even if they were never among the spells she prepared or recalled; once selected, these spells can no longer be changed, as with a normal psychic. Each time the psychic gains access to a new level of spells, she gains full memory of spells 2 levels lower in the same way (gaining full memory and permanently selecting her 2nd-level spells when she gains access to 4thlevel spells, and so on). This ability alters spellcasting.

Spell Recollection					KEY:Amnesiac ~ Spell Recollection				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Amnesiac Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Once per hour as a swift action, an amnesiac can attempt to remember any spell from the psychic spell list of her choice from either of the 2 highest spell levels she can cast. When she does, she rolls on Table 2-1: Spell Recollection to determine the result. Because the mental stress of combat brings memories to the surface more easily, the amnesiac adds 1d10 to this roll's result if she's in combat when she attempts to recall a spell. Regardless of the result, the amnesiac expends an amnesia slot of the appropriate level for the spell she is attempting to remember; she must cast the spell remembered (if any) using that amnesia slot during the same round, or the spell slot is lost without effect. Once a spell has been remembered in this way, the amnesiac can cast it as one of her spells known for the rest of the day (even if she failed to cast the spell during the round in which she remembered it), unless spell recollection allowed her to cast a spell of a higher level than she would normally be able to cast.

Spells with a duration last for their full duration, even if the psychic reverts to his physical form. For feats and other abilities that require these spells as prerequisites, the psychic counts as knowing the spells but can benefit from the feats and abilities only while in a formless body. The formless adept gains the following spells at the appropriate levels: chill touch and expeditious retreat (1st), levitate and stricken heartACG (4th), gaseous form and vampiric touch (6th), shadow stepUM and telekinesis (8th), dominate person and synapse overload* (10th), disintegrate and enemy hammerAPG (12th), finger of death and telekinetic sphere (14th), etherealness and power word stun (16th), and dominate monster and telekinetic storm* (18th).

To use this ability, the formless adept must be adjacent to the target. This effect works as the greater possession* spell and can be maintained only as long as the formless adept maintains his incorporeal body form. The target can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the formless adept's class level + the formless adept's Intelligence modifier to resist the effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the formless adept's psychic possession for 24 hours.

Formless Master		KEY:Formless Adept ~ Formless Master	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Formless Adept Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 20th level, a formless adept can assume any formless body as a swift action and change between formless body types as a standard action (without returning to his physical form first). He can use the formless spell phrenic amplification to cast any spell with a swiftaction casting time when assuming a formless body or any spell with a standard-action casting time while switching between formless bodies. The formless adept also adds his Charisma bonus as a deflection bonus to his AC while in a formless body. A formless adept can attempt a saving throw to bypass any spells that prevent entry of incorporeal creatures (such as anti-incorporeal shellACG), even if the spells don't normally allow one.

# Mutation Mind
Physical Mutation			KEY:Mutation Mind ~ Physical Mutation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mutation Mind Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[not implemented]A mutation mind's psychic powers warp her body, allowing her to physically mutate herself as a swift action, which grants her a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and a -2 penalty to Intelligence. At 12th level, the bonus to Strength increases to +6. A mutation mind can assume her physically mutated form for a number of minutes per day equal to her psychic level. The minutes don't have to be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-minute increments. When the duration runs out, the mutation mind can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to extend the duration by 1 round. She can continue extending it in this way until she runs out of points. After the mutation ends, the mutation mind is fatigued and can't activate a physical mutation again for 1 round. Turning back to normal before the end of a 1-minute increment takes a standard action.

Phrenic Empowerment		KEY:Mutation Mind ~ Phrenic Empowerment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mutation Mind Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 7th level, a mutation mind's phrenic amplifications empower her physical mutation. Whenever a mutation mind modifies a spell with a phrenic amplification while affected by her physical mutation, she can increase the bonus to her Strength score from her physical mutation by 2 for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell she cast. This bonus doesn't stack; if the mutation mind activates it again, she uses the longer duration but doesn't increase the bonus. While under the effect of phrenic empowerment, whenever the mutation mind takes damage, she risks losing control of her powers. At the end of each turn that she takes hit point damage, the mutation mind must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + 1/2 her character level) or take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws and to Intelligence. These penalties last for 1 hour after the physical mutation ends and stack with themselves. If the penalty lowers her Intelligence score to 0, the mutation mind is comatose until 1 hour after physical mutation ends.

# Psychic Duelist
Psychic Duel Acumen		KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Psychic Duel Acumen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:[not implemented]At 4th level, a psychic duelist adds instigate psychic duel* to her list of spells known, and the save DC of any instigate psychic duel spell she casts increases by 1. Beginning at 6th level, she can also expend any unused psychic spell slot of 3rd level or higher to cast instigate psychic duel. If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. In addition, when the psychic duelist sacrifices points from her phrenic pool to generate manifestation points for an offensive manifestation, she uses d8s for damage dice instead of d4s. This ability replaces the 4th-level discipline spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Manifestation Amplifications	KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Manifestation Amplifications	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:[not implemented]At 7th level, a psychic duelist gains a manifestation amplification instead of a phrenic amplification; thereafter, whenever the psychic duelist gains a phrenic amplification, she can select either a phrenic amplification or a manifestation amplification. A manifestation amplification functions for a manifestation as a phrenic amplification does for a spell, with the same restrictions. The manifestation being amplified is called the linked manifestation. Phrenic pool points spent toward manifestation amplifications are separate from points sacrificed to generate manifestation points. For example, a psychic duelist capable of casting 4th-level spells (with a maximum of 4 MP per manifestation) could turn 4 points from her phrenic pool into MP and spend 2 points on a manifestation amplification, expending a total of 6 points from her phrenic pool.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Extended Effect			KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Extended Effect			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic duelist can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the duration of a condition by 1 round per point spent. She can spend a maximum of 1 phrenic pool point in this way; this maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level, to 3 points at 15th level, and to 4 points at 19th level. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, this amplification has no effect (though the points are still lost). This amplification can be linked only to offensive manifestations that impose conditions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Faithful Creature			KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Faithful Creature			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:When she manifests a thoughtform creature, the psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give that creature the ability to persist even if it doesn't attack. She can concentrate to maintain the creature as a swift action instead of as a full-round action, but the creature can attack only if the psychic duelist concentrates as a full-round action. In addition, the psychic backlash damage from that thought-form creature is halved. This amplification can be linked only to thoughtform creature manifestations.

Punishing Thought-form		KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Punishing Thought-form		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase the damage die size of an offensive manifestation by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, or d8 to d10). This amplification can be linked only to offensive manifestations.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Reciprocal Defense		KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Reciprocal Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when using a defensive manifestation to improve her defenses in the real world as well. Her physical body gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for the number of rounds the defensive manifestation lasts, or for 1 round if the manifestation doesn't have a duration. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and to +4 at 15th level. This amplification can be linked only to defensive manifestations. This ability replaces the 7th-level phrenic amplification and alters phrenic amplifications.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Thought Made Real			KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Thought Made Real			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 9th level, a psychic duelist can bring offensive manifestations directly into her foes' minds, attacking with them without entering a psychic duel. When doing so, she can generate manifestation points only by sacrificing a spell, not through any other methods. Using an offensive manifestation in this way functions as casting a spell with a full-round-action casting time. Conditions imposed by these offensive manifestations last for their full duration, even though the target isn't in a psychic duel. The psychic duelist can use manifestation amplifications on offensive manifestations created this way. Such offensive manifestations can't affect thought-form creatures. This is a mind-affecting illusion (phantasm) effect. A thoughtform creature manifested in this way is visible only to its target. This ability replaces telepathic bond.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Expert Manifester			KEY:Psychic Duelist ~ Expert Manifester			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Duelist Class Feature.Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 17th level, a psychic duelist doesn't have to expend as many resources to create manifestations. She gains 1 additional MP each time she creates a psychic manifestation, in addition to the MP she gains by sacrificing resources. This doesn't increase the maximum number of points she can spend per manifestation, but does allow her to create a manifestation costing 1 MP without sacrificing any resources. This ability replaces telepathy.

# Ectoplasmatist
Ectoplasmic Lash						KEY:Ectoplasmatist ~ Ectoplasmic Lash					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ectoplasmatist Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[not implemented]At 1st level, as a full-round action an ectoplasmatist can manifest one or two lashes of ectoplasm tethered to her by wispy, ectoplasmic tendrils. If she manifests two lashes, she can wield them both as light melee weapons, each dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19-20/x2. If the ectoplasmatist manifests only one lash, she can manifest it either as a single one-handed melee weapon that deals 1d8 points of slashing damage (1d6 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19-20/x2, or as a two-handed melee weapon that deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (1d10 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical multiplier of x2. Only the ectoplasmatist can wield or use these lashes. Dismissing any or all manifested lashes is a free action. At 2nd level, the ectoplasmatist's lashes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and are treated as magic weapons. At 4th level, the ectoplasmatist can use her lashes as reach weapons or use them to manipulate objects from a distance. When used as weapons, the lashes gain an additional 5 feet of reach. Unlike most other weapons with reach, the lashes can be used to attack foes anywhere within the ectoplasmatist's reach (including adjacent foes). Attacks with the lashes' extended reach provoke attacks of opportunity just as if the ectoplasmatist were attacking with a ranged weapon. When the lashes are used to manipulate items, they have the same manual dexterity as the ectoplasmatist's hands. Using the lashes to manipulate items always provokes attacks of opportunity, even if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking normally wouldn't. At 6th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +2, and they are treated as having the ectoplasmatist's alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 8th level, the ectoplasmatist's lashes become ghost touch weapons and their reach increases by another 5 feet (for a total increase of 10 feet). Additionally, attacks with the lashes against nonadjacent foes no longer provoke attacks of opportunity. Using the lashes to manipulate objects from a distance still provokes attacks of opportunity, but only if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking would normally provoke such attacks (instead of always provoking). At 10th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +3. At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a single emotional focus (anger, dedication, despair, fear, hatred, jealousy, or zeal). The ectoplasmatist's lashes gain a special weapon ability as if affected by a spirit-bound blade spell (see page 187) matching the emotional energy of the focus the ectoplasmatist has chosen. At 14th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +4. At 16th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a second emotional focus, and her lashes gain the special weapon abilities as if affected by a spirit-bound blade spell with the special weapon ability of both of the ectoplasmatist's chosen emotional foci. At 18th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +5. This ability replaces etheric tether, phantom, shared consciousness, fused consciousness, spiritual bond, and empowered consciousness.

Spiritual Combat						KEY:Ectoplasmatist ~ Spiritual Combat					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ectoplasmatist Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[not implemented]At 3rd level, as a full-round action, an ectoplasmatist can make all of her attacks with a single light or one-handed ectoplasmic lash wielded in one hand, and also cast a single spiritualist spell with a casting time of one standard action as a free action either before or after making the ectoplasmic lash attacks. The ectoplasmatist takes a -2 penalty on her attack rolls when using spiritual combat. If she decides to cast the spell defensively, she can choose to take an additional penalty on her attack rolls up to her Wisdom bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If the concentration check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. Also, when the ectoplasmatist casts a spiritualist spell with a range of touch, she can deliver the spell through one of her ectoplasmic lashes. Instead of making the free melee touch attack she would normally use to deliver the spell, the ectoplasmatist can choose to make a free ectoplasmic lash attack at her highest base attack bonus. A successful lash attack deals damage normally and imparts the spell's effects. The ectoplasmatist can't hold the charge if her lash attack misses. This ability replaces bonded manifestation, phantom recall, and dual bond.

Ectoplasmic Armor						KEY:Ectoplasmatist ~ Ectoplasmic Armor					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ectoplasmatist Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:[not implemented as temp bonus]At 4th level when an ectoplasmatist manifests her spiritual lash ability, tendrils of ectoplasmic material envelop her body, granting her a +4 armor bonus to AC. At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist's armor bonus to AC increases to +6 and is treated as ghost touch armor. This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.

# Fractured Mind
Emotional Spellcasting		KEY:Fractured Mind ~ Emotional Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fractured Mind Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:[not implemented]A fractured mind's ability to cast spells is tied to the force of her own spirit rather than her connection to the spirit world. As a result, she uses her Charisma score rather than her Wisdom score to determine the highest spell level she can cast, the saving throw DCs of spells she casts, and her bonus spells per day. This ability alters spellcasting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.109
Emotional Power			KEY:Fractured Mind ~ Emotional Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fractured Mind Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:[not implemented]The fractured mind gains a number of spell-like abilities, which are tied to her phantom's emotional focus. She gains one spell-like ability at 5th level, a second at 7th level, a third at 9th level, and a fourth at 16th level. A fractured mind can use each of these abilities once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond the level at which she gained the spell-like ability. The saving throw DCs for these spell-like abilities are equal to 10 + 1/2 the fractured mind's spiritualist class level + the fractured mind's Charisma modifier, rather than being based on the spell's level. The spell-like abilities granted by each emotional focus are listed below.	DESC:&nl;Anger: Enlarge person (5th), rage (7th), longstrider (9th), shout (16th).	DESC:&nl;Dedication: Command (5th), spiritual weapon (7th), bless (9th), death ward (16th).	DESC:&nl;Despair: BungleUM (5th), stricken heartACG (7th), doom (9th), crushing despair (16th).

# Geist Channeler
Geistform Phantom		KEY:Geist Channeler ~ Geistform Phantom		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geist Channeler Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A geist channeler's phantom can't manifest in ectoplasmic form, and is limited to manifesting in incorporeal form. As a result, the phantom has no Strength score, and has a starting Wisdom score of 12. Instead of gaining two slam attacks, it gains only a single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. The slam attack's damage increases to 1d10 points at 5th level, to 2d6 at 10th level, to 2d8 at 15th level, and 2d10 at 20th level (assuming the phantom is Medium). The phantom does not gain the magic attacks ability at 4th level. While manifested incorporeally, a geist channeler's phantom can attack only other incorporeal creatures. Because the phantom is incorporeal, the damage it deals to such creatures is not reduced as a result of them being incorporeal. At 5th level, the phantom can take a swift action to infuse itself with trace amounts of ectoplasm so it can attack corporeal creatures for 1 round. During that time, it deals half damage to corporeal creatures with its slam, and corporeal creatures with nonmagical weapons deal half damage to the phantom. At 10th level, when the phantom infuses itself, its attacks deal normal damage to corporeal creatures. This ability alters the phantom.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.109
Emotionless			KEY:Geist Channeler ~ Emotionless			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geist Channeler Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A geist channeler's phantom doesn't have an emotional focus; instead, it is cold and devoid of emotions. The phantom gains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (religion) equal to its Hit Dice. While confined in the geist channeler's consciousness, the phantom grants the geist channeler Skill Focus in each of these skills. The phantom has good Reflex and Will saves, and gains Iron Will as a bonus feat, as well as the following abilities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Unnerving Touch		KEY:Geist Channeler ~ Unnerving Touch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geist Channeler Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, a geist channeler's phantom can make a melee touch attack against a living creature, even if that creature is corporeal. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) negates this effect. At 5th level, when the phantom can damage corporeal creatures with its slam attack, its slam attacks against living corporeal creatures gain this ability. Multiple attacks against the same creature don't cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Poltergeist's Knack	KEY:Geist Channeler ~ Poltergeist's Knack		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geist Channeler Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 7th level, a geist channeler's phantom can use telekinesis as a spell-like ability. It can use only the sustained force and violent thrust versions of this spell. The phantom can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time at 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter (maximum seven times per day at 19th level). Its caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to the phantom's Hit Dice.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Spectral Protection	KEY:Geist Channeler ~ Spectral Protection		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geist Channeler Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 12th level as a standard action, while a geist channeler's phantom is confined within his psyche, he can call upon its power to project an aura of spectral energy that prevents incorporeal creatures from approaching him. This takes the form of a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the geist channeler. Any incorporeal creature attempting to enter this area must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the geist channeler's spiritualist class level + the geist channeler's Wisdom modifier) or be unable to do so. This ability can be used only defensively, not aggressively; forcing the aura against an incorporeal creature collapses the aura. The geist channeler can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his spiritualist level. The minutes don't need to be continuous, but must be spent in 1-minute increments.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Malevolent Possession	KEY:Geist Channeler ~ Malevolent Possession	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geist Channeler Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 17th level, a geist channeler's phantom can invade the bodies of other creatures. This functions as possession (see page 181). To use this ability, the phantom must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier). The phantom can use this ability once per day. This ability modifies the phantom and replaces the phantom's emotional focus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Spiritual Manifestation	KEY:Geist Channeler ~ Spiritual Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geist Channeler Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Because of the nature of her phantom, a geist channeler can use the bonded manifestation ability to manifest his phantom only in incorporeal form. This ability alters bonded manifestation.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.110

# Haunted
Usurp Manifestation	KEY:Haunted ~ Usurp Manifestation					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Haunted Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, the haunted's phantom begins to subtly subvert the relationship with its master, gaining rather than granting power from the connection. When fully manifested in ectoplasmic form, the phantom can use its usurp manifestation ability to draw upon the haunted's body to strengthen its ectoplasmic might, temporarily weakening the spiritualist in order to increase its own power. The phantom must activate this ability as an immediate action at the start of the spiritualist's turn, and it can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the haunted's spiritualist level. The rounds don't need to be consecutive, and the phantom can dismiss the effects of a usurped manifestation as a free action on its turn. While this ability is in effect, the haunted's features become sunken and withdrawn, and she gains the nauseated condition until the effect ends. Conversely, the phantom surges in size and power, becoming one size category larger (as if affected by an enlarge person spell) and increasing its natural armor bonus to AC by 2 for the effect's duration. If the spiritualist prevents or mitigates the nauseated condition, the phantom is unable to siphon energy and doesn't gain the benefits of usurp manifestation. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th levels), the phantom gains new abilities while using usurp manifestation.	DESC:&nl;Usurp Spell: At 8th level, while using usurp manifestation, the phantom can leech spell slots from the haunted to increase its own power. The phantom can reach through the etheric tether as a swift action to drain the nauseated haunted's psychic spell energy, effectively taking any touch spell or spell with a target of "you" that the haunted knows and casting it on itself (assuming the haunted has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level). This ability consumes two of the haunted's spell slots of the appropriate level and otherwise follows the rules for the share spells and deliver touch spells abilities.	DESC:&nl;Teleplasmic Surge: At 13th level, when using usurp manifestation, the phantom gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.	DESC:&nl;Ferocious Phantom: At 18th level, when using usurp manifestation the phantom gains DR 10/slashing and spell resistance equal to 11 + the haunted's spiritualist level (this spell resistance doesn't apply to spells originating from the spiritualist or from the usurp spell ability). This ability replaces bonded manifestation.																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Usurped Bond		KEY:Haunted ~ Usurped Bond						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Haunted Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 17th level, the haunted's phantom can use usurp manifestation for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + double the haunted's spiritualist level. This ability replaces dual bond.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.111

# Onmyoji
Divine Spellcasting	KEY:Onmyoji ~ Divine Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Onmyoji Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:An onmyoji's spellcasting ability comes from divine rather than psychic power. As a divine caster, the onmyoji's spells use verbal components instead of thought components, and somatic components instead of emotional components, and she uses an ofuda as a divine focus. Ofudas are scrolls with holy writings written on parchment, cloth, or wood (having the same cost as a wooden holy symbol) or metal (having the same cost as a silver holy symbol). This ability alters spellcasting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.111
Spiritual Resistance	KEY:Onmyoji ~ Spiritual Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Onmyoji Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:An onmyoji's phantom provides her with protection from supernatural forces. While the phantom is confined within the onmyoji's consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested), it grants her a +2 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey, outsiders, and incorporeal undead. At 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces shared consciousness and fused consciousness.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.111
Divine Teachings		KEY:Onmyoji ~ Divine Teachings	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Onmyoji Class Feature.Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:An onmyoji gains the ability to call upon her phantom to help her cast spells she normally couldn't. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, an onmyoji can choose a single spell from the cleric spell list with a spell level she is currently able to cast, and add that spell to her list of spells known, at the same spell level as it appears on the cleric spell list. Because the onmyoji relies on her phantom's influence in order to cast these spells, she can cast spells added in this way only while the phantom is confined within her consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested). This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.

As a standard action, the ectochymist can expend a use of ectoplasmic blanche to coat the inside of a container with his blanche and throw it at an incorporeal creature as a ranged touch attack. If he hits, the creature receives a Will save to escape the trap (DC = 10 + 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier). If the creature fails its save, it is sealed within the vessel until someone breaks or opens that vessel. The ghost trap automatically survives being thrown at the incorporeal creature, but otherwise is only as durable as the vessel (normally hardness 5, 1 hp for a glass bottle).This ability replaces the 8th-level alchemist discovery.

Homunculus Companion					KEY:Promethean Alchemist ~ Homunculus Companion					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Promethean Alchemist Class Feature.Alchemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the service of a homunculus companion. The means for creating this special homunculus are more exotic than normal and require investiture of the promethean alchemist's own life essence into the homunculus. This construct generally resembles a small humanoid or child when first created; the specific appearance is up to its creator, though a homunculus is always humanoid in shape and obviously unnatural on close inspection. While every homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master, some homunculi's loyalty borders on the unsettling; such companions jealously protect their masters from threats or construct strange shrines in their masters' honor. A homunculus companion can be of any alignment, even one that is different from its master's. A destroyed homunculus companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator's blood per Hit Die of the homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp per Hit Die of the homunculus. Performing this ritual takes 1 hour (though it may take some time to gather enough blood at higher levels, so many promethean alchemists keep chilled blood samples in storage just in case). A promethean alchemist can't take the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries. This ability replaces bombs and mutagen.

# Ghost Rider
Ghost Mount							KEY:Ghost Rider ~ Ghost Mount				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Rider Class Feature.Cavalier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a ghost rider gains the ability to manifest a special mount of conjured ectoplasm rather than one of flesh and bone. This spectral companion functions like a spiritualist's phantom companion, using the ghost rider's cavalier level as her effective spiritualist level. The phantom takes the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of a cavalier's normal mount options for her size and class level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost rider or a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose a mount that is capable of bearing her weight, that has four or more legs, and that lacks a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments). The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. The ghost rider can manifest her ghost mount only in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist's etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount. The mount shares the cavalier's alignment. Though the mount cannot speak, it understands its master's verbal commands and gains the phantom's link ability. The ghost mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and can have ranks in any of the following skills: Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). The ghost rider's ghost mount does not gain the share spells, deliver touch spells, or incorporeal flight abilities. Ghost mounts do not gain emotional focus abilities. The ghost rider does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding her mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat.

Frightful Gaze						KEY:Ghost Rider ~ Frightful Gaze					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Rider Class Feature.Cavalier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a ghost rider can use this ability on opponents within 30 feet as a standard action, which acts as a gaze attack until the ghost rider's next turn. Creatures within range that meet the ghost rider's gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider's class level + the ghost rider's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures that successfully save against that ghost rider's frightful gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this ability can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects, though it still counts as a fear effect. The ghost rider can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her Charisma modifier.

At 14th level, the mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to the ghost rider's class level. This ability replaces mighty charge and greater banner.

# Relic Hunter
Spells							KEY:Relic Hunter ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Relic Hunter Class Feature.Inquisitor Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:A relic hunter casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list, but her chosen relic schools (see Relics below) limit her to schools she knows, similar in function to an occultist's implements. Any spell or orison gained by the relic hunter has a relic component (see Relics below), and is not considered to be on the relic hunter's spell list until she selects its school though the relics alternate class feature. Once she chooses a school, all spells and orisons of that school are considered to be on the relic hunter's class spell list, allowing her to use spell trigger and spell completion magic items of those spells. A relic hunter's spells per day, daily spell allotment, Difficulty Class, and minimum Wisdom score requirements remain unchanged from the inquisitor's normal spellcasting class feature.

Relics							KEY:Relic Hunter ~ Relics					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Relic Hunter Class Feature.Inquisitor Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a relic hunter gains the occultist's implements class feature (see page 47) and learns to use two occultist implement schools as relic schools. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the relic hunter learns to use one additional relic school drawn from the same source, gaining access to that school's resonant power and base focus power and opening up that school's focus powers for her to select. Like an occultist, a relic hunter can select the same school twice, but it is far less useful for her to do so. Relics do not need to be magic items, and nonmagical relics do not take up a magic item slot. Relics that are not magic items are often of some religious significance to the relic hunter or her church, such as the battered shield of a saint, a bishop's robe, or the finger bone of a church martyr.

Deific Focus						KEY:Relic Hunter ~ Deific Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Relic Hunter Class Feature.Inquisitor Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a relic hunter learns to invest divine power into her chosen relics. This acts like the occultist's focus powers and mental focus class features (see pages 47 and 48, respectively), with the following adjustments. Each day, a relic hunter has a number of points of deific focus equal to her inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier, and she must spend 1 hour in prayer with her relics to invest them with divine power. These points refresh at the start of each day. At 1st level, the relic hunter learns the two base focus powers from her chosen relic schools and can select one more focus power from the list of those made available by her chosen schools. Whenever she gains a new relic school, she gains the base focus power of that school. In addition, at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she learns a new focus power selected from all of the powers granted by all of the relic schools she knows. She can use these focus powers only by expending points of deif ic focus. Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throws against a focus power is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's class level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modif ier. She cannot select a focus power more than once. She uses her inquisitor level in place of an occultist level to qualify for focus powers.

Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective's spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the psychic detective's Intelligence modifier. Like other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Core Rulebook). At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic detective can cast.

# Mindblade
Spells		KEY:Mindblade ~ Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mindblade Class Feature.Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:A mindblade casts spells from the magus spell list as psychic spells. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mindblade must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC to resist a mindblade's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the mindblade's Intelligence modifier. Like other spellcasters, a mindblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her magus level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Core Rulebook). At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mindblade can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the mindblade loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and the new spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the mindblade can cast. A mindblade need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any magus spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. This ability replaces the magus's spellcasting.

Psychic Pool	KEY:Mindblade ~ Psychic Pool		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mindblade Class Feature.Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A mindblade gains a psychic pool, similar to a normal magus's arcane pool. At 1st level, a mindblade can expend 1 point from her psychic pool as a standard action to manifest a light melee weapon of her choice, formed from psychic energy. By spending 2 points, the mindblade can manifest a one-handed melee weapon, and by spending 3 points, she can manifest a two-handed melee weapon (but not a double weapon). This psychic weapon can last indef initely, but it vanishes if it leaves the mindblade's hand. The mindblade can dismiss a held psychic weapon as a free action. When a psychic weapon vanishes, the mindblade regains the psychic energy used to create it. She can maintain only one weapon at a time. At 1st level, a psychic weapon counts as a magic weapon of whatever type the mindblade selected, with a +1 enhancement bonus. At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the weapon's enhancement bonus increases by 1, up to maximum of +5 at 12th level. Starting at 5th level, the mindblade can add any of the weapon special abilities listed in the arcane pool class feature in place of these bonuses, although the weapon must maintain at least a +1 bonus to benefit from any weapon special abilities. At 15th and 18th levels, the weapon gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus, which the mindblade can spend only on weapon special abilities. This ability replaces arcane pool, and counts as arcane pool for the purpose of feats, abilities, and class features.

At 7th, 11th, 14th, and 19th levels, she adds two more psychic class spells to her spell list, following the same restrictions. When a mindblade takes the spell blending arcana, she gains spells from the psychic class spell list instead of the wizard spell list.

This stacks with other abilities that deal damage based on alignment. He cannot alter his alignment choice until the next time he uses this ability. Creatures that are of the appropriate alignment and are struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the karmic monk's class level + the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier) or lose any damage reduction based on alignment for a number of rounds equal to the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round).

# Escapologist
Elusive							KEY:Escapologist ~ Elusive			SERVESAS:ABILITY=Special Ability|Rogue ~ Trapfinding			CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Escapologist Class Feature.Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Trapfinding		BONUS:SKILL|Disable Device,Escape Artist|RogueLVL/2	DESC:An escapologist adds 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1) as a bonus on all Disable Device and Escape Artist checks. An escapologist can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. This ability replaces trapfinding, but counts as trapfinding for the purposes of prerequisites and abilities that require trapfinding.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Unfettered Mind						KEY:Escapologist ~ Unfettered Mind					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Escapologist Class Feature.Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting her. The DC of this check is equal to the effect's original save DC + 20. She cannot remove effects that do not allow a saving throw. She can attempt to escape even if paralyzed or restrained, as long as she can take purely mental actions. She can attempt this check against a particular effect once per round if the effect is measured in rounds, once per minute if the effect is measured in minutes, once per 10 minutes if the effect is measured in 10-minute intervals, and so on. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Impossible Escape						KEY:Escapologist ~ Impossible Escape				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Escapologist Class Feature.Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, as an immediate action, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check at a -10 penalty and apply the result in place of either a failed Reflex save or her AC against an attack that would have hit her. If she succeeds, her contortions let her avoid the attack or effect entirely. Using this ability leaves the escapologist staggered until the end of her next turn. If the escapologist can't become staggered, she can't use impossible escape. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.123

# False Medium
Dim the Lights						KEY:False Medium ~ Dim the Lights					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:False Medium Class Feature.Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, while in dim light or darkness, a false medium adds 1/2 his rogue level as a bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks, and creatures without low-light vision or darkvision take an equal penalty on skill checks to oppose the false medium's Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.123
False Sensitivity						KEY:False Medium ~ False Sensitivity				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:False Medium Class Feature.Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can't tell the difference between the false medium's scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks. An onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium's Bluff check, to detect the fraud. In any case, any results of the false medium's charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism). This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Haunting Presences					KEY:False Medium ~ Haunting Presences				CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:False Medium Class Feature.Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff skill checks to emulate the effects of dancing lights, ghost sound, silent image, or ventriloquism by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion, so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects like true seeing don't detect the fakery. This ability replaces trap sense.

# Ghost Hunter
Ghostly Smite						KEY:Ghost Hunter ~ Ghostly Smite						CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Hunter Class Feature.Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A ghost hunter's smite evil ability does not automatically bypass DR (other than DR/good). However, she treats her weapon as a ghost touch weapon against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra damage on the first attack against evil outsiders and evil dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage per paladin level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack (instead of 2 points). This ability alters smite evil.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Exorcise Possession					KEY:Ghost Hunter ~ Exorcise Possession					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Hunter Class Feature.Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 6th level, a ghost hunter can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature. She must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands ability. The target can immediately attempt a Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw. This ability replaces the 6th-level mercy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Speak to the Restless					KEY:Ghost Hunter ~ Speak to the Restless					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ghost Hunter Class Feature.Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 9th level, a ghost hunter can commune with the spirits of the restless dead once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature's head in her possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as speak with hauntACG or as speak with dead (but affecting only undead rather than only corpses), using the ghost hunter's class level as the caster level. This ability replaces the 9th-level mercy.

# Ley Line Guardian
Ley Line Powered						KEY:Ley Line Guardian ~ Ley Line Powered					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ley Line Guardian Class Feature.Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Instead of preparing her spells, a ley line guardian draws the power casting spells directly from ley lines. A ley line guardian is a spontaneous spellcaster. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spell slots per day as a sorcerer of her witch level. Bonus spells granted by a ley line guardian's patron are added to the ley line guardian's total spells known at the appropriate levels. This ability alters the witch's spellcasting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.125
Conduit Surge						KEY:Ley Line Guardian ~ Conduit Surge					CATEGORY:Special Ability				TYPE:Ley Line Guardian Class Feature.Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a ley line guardian is adept at channeling energy from ley lines to enhance her own spells. As a swift action, she can increase her effective caster level for the next spell she casts in that round by 1d4-1 levels. After performing a conduit surge, the ley line guardian must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + level of spell cast + number of additional caster levels granted) or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell cast. At 8th level, the caster level increase becomes 1d4. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modif ier. This ability replaces familiar and the hexes gained at 1st and 8th levels.

###Block: Occult Skill Unlocks
Automatic Writing (Linguistics)	KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Automatic Writing	SOURCEPAGE:p.194	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You can produce mysterious writing that pertains to the immediate future, either under the influence of enigmatic guiding spirits or by unleashing your subconscious intuition. Check: Once per week, you can spend 1 hour posing questions while your hand unconsciously scribbles messages of varying legibility and accuracy. At the end of this hour, you attempt a Linguistics check to decipher the meanings of these messages. If successful, you gain information as though you had used augury. If you have 10 or more ranks in Linguistics, you can attempt a higher DC check to instead gain information as though you had used divination. The chance of successfully producing coherent or meaningful writing from any of these effects equals 60%% plus 5%% for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC (to a maximum of 90%%). You must choose which DC you'll try to meet before attempting the check. The GM rolls the check and d%% roll secretly, so that you can't tell whether the messages are accurate. Action: Automatic writing takes 1 hour. Try Again: Yes. You can attempt to learn more about a subject, but can still attempt only one check per week.
Dowsing (Survival)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Dowsing			SOURCEPAGE:p.195	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You channel mysterious forces in the nearby environment to locate hidden resources. Check: Once per day, you can follow a dowsing rod's movements to locate a particular type of location. Each attempt requires 10 minutes of intense concentration, after which you attempt the Survival check with the DC listed on the table below. The maximum range at which you can detect anything using dowsing is 400 feet + 40 feet per rank in Survival you possess. The rod's directions persist for up to 10 minutes. You choose a particular target each time you dowse, and get the following information on a successful check. Find Water: The dowsing rod points toward the largest source of fresh water within range, including aquifers, lakes, ponds, and springs. Grave Dowsing: The dowsing rod points in the direction of the largest burial site, cairn, or tomb within range. Locate Metal and Gems: You concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. On a successful check, the dowsing rod points to the largest quantity of the selected mineral within range. Action: Dowsing attempts take 10 minutes to initiate. The results of the check persist for 10 minutes afterward. Try Again: Yes. You can try to dowse from the same location more than once, but still only once per day.
Faith Healing (Heal)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Faith Healing		SOURCEPAGE:p.195	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You apply esoteric principles to temporarily suspend or remove curses, diseases, and ability damage. Check: You can use faith healing once per day. The DC and effect of the Heal check depend on the task you attempt. You can't use faith healing on yourself. Restore Vitality: You suppress ability damage. You perform a 1-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check against the DC of the effect that caused the ability damage. If you succeed at the check, you temporarily suppress 1 point of ability damage for 1 hour, plus 1 additional point and hour for every 5 by which the check result exceeds the DC. A creature can benefit from this treatment no more than once per day. Suspend Affliction: You treat one curse, disease, or poison affecting a creature. You enter into a deep trance for 1 hour while you treat the subject, after which you attempt your Heal check. If the check is successful, you suspend the effects of the affliction by 1 hour, plus 1 hour for every 5 by which you exceed the DC. This time doesn't count against the effect's duration (if any). The affliction can still be cured by other means while it's suspended. Remove Affliction: You can attempt to permanently remove an affliction in an 8-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check. If the result of the check is at least double the DC of the original affliction, the sufferer can attempt another saving throw using the original DC to permanently cast off the effect. Action: Restoring vitality and suspending afflictions each require 1 hour in a quiet environment. Permanent removal of afflictions requires 8 hours of heavy activity. Try Again: Varies. A creature can't be the subject of faith healing more than once per day. You can't try to permanently remove an affliction again.
Hypnotism (Diplomacy)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Hypnotism			SOURCEPAGE:p.195	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You use the power of suggestion and subtle psychic influence to alter a subject's mind and dredge up repressed memories. Check: You can use hypnotism once per day. The DC of a Diplomacy check to hypnotize is 20 + the subject's Will save modifier against mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. All uses of hypnotism are mindaffecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. Implant Suggestion: You can implant a suggested course of reasonable action in the mind of a willing creature, along with a defined trigger. To implant a suggestion, you spend 1 minute inducing a trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If the check is successful, you implant the course of action, as a suggestion spell with a duration of 10 minutes plus 10 additional minutes for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC. If the subject ceases to be willing, it can attempt a Will save once each round to shake off the effects. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier. You can attempt to subtly implant a suggestion in the mind of an unwilling creature with an attitude of indifferent or better after 1 minute of continuous, calm interaction with that creature, but the DC is 10 higher. Recall Memory: You can draw out forgotten memories from a willing subject. You spend 1 minute inducing a calming, trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If you succeed at the check, the hypnotized creature can reroll any previously failed Intelligence or Knowledge check to recall the forgotten information with a +4 bonus. The information must be something the subject once knew or was exposed to. Action: Hypnotism takes 1 minute of calm interaction. Try Again: Yes. You can try to hypnotize the same creature more than once, but only once per day.
Phrenology (Knowledge [Arcana])	KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Phrenology			SOURCEPAGE:p.196	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You examine the skulls of intelligent creatures to analyze the subjects' psychological attributes, since the shape of the brain influences the shape of the skull. Check: Once per day, you can use your fingertips to examine the shape of a creature's skull. Reading a creature's skull requires 1 minute of concentration and scrutiny while you physically manipulate the skull. This technique can be used on a willing, helpless, or paralyzed creature, or on decomposed remains (as long as the skull is intact or can be pieced together). This skill can't be used on creatures without discernible skulls, such as constructs, elementals, oozes, or plants. After the minute is up, the GM attempts a secret Knowledge (arcana) check. The DC is typically modified by the subject's Hit Dice. With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when examining a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature's race and age, gender, alignment, and class, but not its level or HD. Action: Reading a creature's cranium requires 1 minute of uninterrupted study. Try Again: Yes. Reexamining a skull may provide new insights. You can attempt only one such check per day.
Prognostication (Sense Motive)	KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Prognostication		SOURCEPAGE:p.196	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You are skilled in means of folk divination. The most common methods are cartomancy (reading cards), cheiromancy (reading a creature's palms), crystallomancy (crystal-gazing), extispicy (reading animal entrails), horoscopy (reading a creature's birth stars), oneiromancy (interpreting dreams), osteomancy (reading cast bones), and pyromancy (reading flames). Check: Once per day, you can predict a creature's fortune for the near future. You spend 10 minutes interpreting the divination means at your disposal. The GM then attempts a secret Sense Motive check with a DC modified by the subject's Hit Dice (see the table below). The result of the check can give you basic insight into the subject's nature, including its alignment, class, and levels or Hit Dice, and might reveal clues to the creature's immediate future. Determining the immediate future as an augury spell has a chance of successfully interpreting meaningful readings equal to 60%% plus 5%% for every point by which the check result exceeds the DC (to a maximum of 90%%). With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when telling the fortune of a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature's alignment and class, but not its level, HD, or fortune. Action: Reading a creature's fortune requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted contemplation, and the subject creature must be present. Try Again: Yes. You can attempt to read a particular creature's fortune repeatedly, but only once per 24 hours. Special: Specially crafted items purchased for the exclusive use of this skill grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Sense Motive checks to prognosticate.
Psychometry (Appraise)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Psychometry		SOURCEPAGE:p.196	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:You can read the psychic impressions left on objects or in places by previous owners and events. Check: Once per day, you can concentrate for 1 minute while in physical contact with an item or location, during which you receive flashes of insight regarding the subject's nature and ownership. After 1 minute, you attempt a DC 15 Appraise check to decipher the visions. You gain one piece of information about the historical significance or the last previous owner-such as a glimpse of the last owner's appearance or its emotional state when it last used the item-determined by the GM. You learn one more piece of information for every 10 by which your check result exceeds the DC, as long as you concentrate for 1 additional minute for each piece of information. If you fail the check by less than 5 or the item has no significant psychic imprint, you don't learn any information. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the item appears to be psychically significant even if it's not, and the information you gain is wildly inaccurate. If you attempt to use psychometry on an item affected by charge object or implant false reading, you automatically learn all information imprinted by the spell. You must also attempt a Will save. If the item is affected by an implant false reading spell, on a success, you realize the information was false, and can determine the true information as well. On a failure, or if the item is affected by a charge object spell, you believe the information is true. Action: Reading an object requires at least 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration. Try Again: Yes. Multiple readings on an object or place always give the same results unless its circumstances or ownership have changed, but additional checks might reach further back into an object's history. You don't reroll the saving throw to determine if a psychic imprint is false. You can still use psychometry only once per day.
Read Aura (Perception)			KEY:Skill Unlock ~ Read Aura			SOURCEPAGE:p.197	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SkillUnlock.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:DISPLAY		DESC:Your psychic sensitivity allows you to read the psychic and magical auras of creatures and objects. Check: Once per day, you can examine the natural aura of a creature or object to discern the subject's alignment, emotions, health, or magic. This requires 10 minutes of concentration, after which you attempt a Perception check. Each time, you must pick one of four auras to read: alignment, emotion, health, or magic. The result of the check applies only to the selected aura. You must be within 30 feet of the subject at all times during the reading. Objects typically have only magic auras, though some also have alignment auras (and intelligent items have emotion auras). You can still attempt to detect a type of aura an object doesn't have, but you get no results. The DC varies depending on the aura, as shown on the table. Read Alignment Aura: You attempt to read the alignment aura, learning the alignment and its strength. An alignment aura's strength depends on the creature's Hit Dice or item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect evil spell. Read Emotion Aura: The colors within the target's aura reveal its emotional state. If successful, you learn the target's disposition and its attitude toward any creatures within 30 feet of it. For a number of rounds equal to the amount by which you exceeded the skill check's DC, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against the target. Read Health Aura: Viewing the flow of vital force, you assess a creature's physical condition. You learn if the creature is unharmed or wounded, if it is poisoned or diseased, and whether it is affected by any of the following conditions: confused, disabled, dying, nauseated, panicked, staggered, stunned, and unconscious. You also learn the total number of points available in its ki pool, grit pool, or similar resource. Read Magic Aura: You attempt to determine the number and power of all magical auras on a target creature or object (see detect magic to determine a magic aura's power). If the check is successful, you can attempt Knowledge (arcana) or Spellcraft checks to determine the school or identify properties of a magic item, as normal. If the item is affected by magic aura or a similar spell, you can realize this and determine the actual properties of the item if your check result exceeds the DC by 5 or more. If the spell is of a higher level (such as aura alteration), increase this threshold DC by 2 for every spell level beyond 1st. Action: Reading an aura requires 10 minutes of study. Try Again: Yes. You can read a creature or object's aura more than once, whether you read the same aura or a different one. You can still attempt only one skill check to read an aura per day.
