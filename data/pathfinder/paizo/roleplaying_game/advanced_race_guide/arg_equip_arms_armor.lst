Helmet (Dwarven Boulder)						OUTPUTNAME:Helmet, Dwarven Boulder									TYPE:Headgear.Resizable.Melee.Dwarven.Bludgeoning.Exotic	COST:20	WT:10		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4	WIELD:Light		SPELLFAILURE:20		SPROP:This heavy, reinforced helmet can be used to make melee attacks. The wearer may also use the helmet when attempting bull rush maneuvers, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on the check, but after completing the maneuver (whether successful or not), the wearer is staggered until the end of his next turn. In addition, the helmet grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the wearer's AC against critical hit confirmation rolls. A dwarven boulder helmet adds 20%% to the wearer's arcane spell failure chance. It occupies the head slot and is made of metal, not stone, meaning that it can be crafted from unusual materials as a metal weapon. A dwarven boulder helmet can be enchanted as a weapon (not as armor, despite providing some protection).|PRERULE:1,DisplayWeaponDetails	AUTO:EQUIP|Weapon (Dwarven Boulder)
