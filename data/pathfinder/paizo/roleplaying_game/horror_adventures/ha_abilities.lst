Accursed						KEY:Corruption ~ Accursed							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptionType														DEFINE:AccursedCorruptionResistance|0			SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:A foul curse has a deep hold on your body and soul. Your resentment toward the one who cursed you has taken on a life of its own. You notice slights against you by everyone around you, and can gain solace only by punishing them. The progression is tied to spiteful actions you take that have lasting consequences. When you inflict a permanent or long-lasting curse, such as bestow curse, or engage in brutal retaliation (what constitutes brutal retaliation is up to the GM, but usually includes disproportionate acts of violence against living creatures), you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC %1). You must also attempt a saving throw after any month in which you have failed to perform a number of spiteful retaliations equal to or greater than your manifestation level. If you fail any of these saving throws, you must use the most severe punishment at your disposal against the next creature that wrongs you, even in a minor way. If you fail the save but your allies or others prevent you from exacting your retribution for three consecutive slights, you shake off this urge. You avoid having to exact retribution for the time being, and your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time you shake off this urge, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage.|15+AccursedManifestationLevel		DESC:You gain a +%1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing.|AccursedCorruptionResistance|PREVARGTEQ:AccursedCorruptionResistance,1		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Accursed Corruption Counter

Ghoul							KEY:Corruption ~ Ghoul								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptionType														DEFINE:GhoulCorruptionResistance|0				SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:A hunger for the flesh of the living grows more every day, until every sentient creature seems no more than a meal. Each week, you need to consume one portion of flesh from a sentient creature. A creature one size category smaller than you counts as one portion, a creature of your size category counts as four portions, and a creature one size larger counts as 16 portions. The extra meat from Huge or larger creatures spoils quickly enough that it can't all be consumed within a week. After a week, if you haven't consumed enough flesh, you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC %1) each day until you've eaten enough. If you fail the save, the next time you rest your corruption takes over and you unconsciously hunt and feed, devouring a living sentient creature completely. In this state, you can't differentiate between creatures and might consume an innocent; if you do so, your corruption progresses to the next stage. If circumstances make it impossible to feed (such as if you are tied down or in a locale with nothing to feed upon), you start to starve as if you had not eaten in 3 days (Core Rulebook 445), and you continue to hunger for flesh and struggle to escape and feed until you have received five times the amount of flesh from sentient creatures you normally require. If your allies are able to restrain and feed you flesh from sentient creatures, your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage. In addition to starvation, close brushes with death also increase your craving for flesh. Whenever you are dropped below 0 hit points, you must attempt a single saving throw as if you hadn't eaten enough flesh that week.|15+GhoulManifestationLevel		DESC:You gain a +%1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing.|GhoulCorruptionResistance|PREVARGTEQ:GhoulCorruptionResistance,1		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Ghoul Corruption Counter

# Lycanthropy Corruption
# ==============================

Lycanthropy						KEY:Corruption ~ Lycanthropy							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptionType														DEFINE:LycanthropyCorruptionResistance|0			SOURCEPAGE:p.28		DESC:Lycanthropy is contracted from being savagely wounded by the teeth or claws of a lycanthrope, typically when reduced to less than 10%% of your maximum hit points in a single combat with one. (This can vary with the power of the creature.) When you contract this corruption, note the animal associated with the lycanthrope, as that is the kind if lycanthrope you will become. Lycanthropy's progress is tied to the phases of the moon. Each month, the moon is considered full for three nights. At the onset of the corruption, you must attempt a Will saving throw during one of the nights chosen by the GM. For each stage of lycanthropy corruption you have, you must attempt a save on one additional night, eventually needing to save on nights leading up to and possibly after the full moon. The DC of this save is %1. If you fail a save, you don't need to attempt more until the next full moon. Failing a saving throw against this corruption causes you to black out, losing control of your character. During this time, your form becomes that of the associated creature and you give into your animalistic urges, hunting and killing with abandon. The next morning, you regain control, typically in the wilderness without any gear and soaked in blood. If you fail the save but your inner animal is prevented from running free, perhaps because you were restrained, you transform and attempt to run free without a save on the remaining full moon nights, and you also go out of control any time you shift forms during the days of that full moon. If you last through it and remain restrained, your corruption doesn't progress to the next stage. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next stage.|15+LycanthropyManifestationLevel		DESC:You gain a +%1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing.|LycanthropyCorruptionResistance|PREVARGTEQ:LycanthropyCorruptionResistance,1		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Lycanthropy Corruption Counter

# Shadowbound Corruption
# ==============================

Shadowbound						KEY:Corruption ~ Shadowbound							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptionType															DEFINE:ShadowboundCorruptionResistance|0		SOURCEPAGE:p.34		DESC:Shadowbound corruption occurs after a month or more of exposure to the Shadow Plane or shadow magic, or contact with cruel kytons, aberrations, undead, or shadowy fey. Corruption sets in only if it is used to torment or disillusion you at least six times in a month in a deeply personal manner. The corruption progresses when you're tortured by shadow again, when you destroy a thing of beauty or joy because your melancholy makes it unbearable, or when you sow fear. Every month you must spend at least %1 entire days away from all light and other life. If you don't, at the end of the month you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC %2). If you fail, sometime in the next 24 hours you go berserk and destroy something precious. You also need to attempt such a saving throw the first time each day you come across a being or object of great beauty, or a being or object with a strong or overwhelming aura of good (this includes yourself, so to avoid the save, you might need to ruin or tarnish your own beauty). If allies are able to restrain you for 24 hours or otherwise prevent you from destroying anything precious during that time, your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of the Will save to prevent your corruption from progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage. The precious thing you destroy when you fail your save depends on your corruption stage, as noted below. If you voluntarily destroy a being or object related to a later corruption stage, you automatically progress to that stage (you might skip over intervening stages in this manner). For example, the first time that you intentionally terrorize innocents or destroy an important object of beauty, you then immediately proceed to stage 2. Repeating your actions doesn't cause your corruption stage to progress further (if you terrorize innocents again, you don't progress to stage 3).|ShadowboundManifestationLevel*2|15+ShadowboundManifestationLevel		DESC:You gain a +%1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing.|ShadowboundCorruptionResistance|PREVARGTEQ:ShadowboundCorruptionResistance,1		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Shadowbound Corruption Counter

If you don't have the fangs manifestation, you must feed on a helpless or willing creature. If you haven't drunk enough blood after a week, you must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) each day until you have. If you fail, the next time you rest, your corruption takes over and you unconsciously hunt and feed, drinking a sentient creature dry. If circumstances make it impossible to feed (such as if you are tied down or in a locale with nothing to feed upon) you start to starve as if you had not eaten in 3 days (Core Rulebook 445), and you continue to thirst for blood and struggle to escape and feed until you have received five times the amount of blood from sentient creatures you normally require. If your allies are able to restrain and feed you, your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack, and last until your corruption reaches the next stage. Whenever you drop below 0 hit points, you must attempt a save as if you hadn't drunk enough blood that week.|15+VampirismManifestationLevel		DESC:You gain a +%1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing.|VampirismCorruptionResistance|PREVARGTEQ:VampirismCorruptionResistance,1		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Vampirism Corruption Counter
