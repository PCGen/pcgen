You can release the spirit at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit returns to its former location and begins rejuvenating or manifesting again as normal. If you die from the Constitution damage, the spirit is	DESC:released, and if you become comatose from the Wisdom damage, the spirit gains control of your body (and can release itself whenever it desires).|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:released.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity										SOURCEPAGE:p.79	BENEFIT:When an incorporeal undead with the rejuvenation special ability or a haunt is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points within 30 feet of you, you can attempt to absorb its spirit into your body as an immediate action. You must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 5 + twice the CR of the undead creature or haunt. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature, you receive a +2 bonus on this saving throw. If you succeed, you harbor the undead or haunt's essence, and it cannot continue to rejuvenate or manifest until you release it. For every 24 hours that you harbor the entity, you must attempt a Constitution check (DC = 10 + the CR of the undead or haunt). If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature, you receive a +2 bonus on this check. If you fail the check, you take 1d4 points of Constitution and

PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CHA,13				DESC:You are able to flare your alignment aura to debilitate your foes.																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.82	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you channel energy, you are also able to cause your divine aura to flare in a display of overwhelming force, affecting all good creatures within the aura (if you channel negative energy) or all evil creatures in the aura (if you channel positive energy). This effect is in addition to the normal effects of channeling energy. When you flare your aura, select from one of the following options based on the strength of your alignment aura. You can select a lower-strength effect. [Strong] Affected creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your class level in the class granting you the channel energy ability + your Charisma bonus) or be fatigued for 1d4 rounds. [Overwhelming] Affected creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your class level in the class granting you the channel energy ability + your Charisma bonus) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.

PRETOTALAB:2										DESC:When cut in combat, you spray your blood into the faces of your foes.																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.82	BENEFIT:Whenever a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack that deals bleed damage, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or become blinded for 1d4 rounds as your blood sprays it in the face. Additionally, if you have a special ability that deals bleed damage (such as a rogue's bleeding strike rogue talent), as a standard action, you can deal 1 point of bleed damage to yourself to spray blood in the face of an adjacent creature of your choice, causing the same effect. The creature only needs to attempt the saving throw for the first of its attacks that deals bleed damage.|10+TL/2+CON
Bouncing Spell-Like Ability					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Monster																																																																																										PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.																																																																																																									DESC:You can retarget one of your spell-like abilities when it fails to affect its original target.																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:Benefit: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a bouncing spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). Whenever you use a bouncing spell-like ability against a single target and the ability has no effect on it (whether due to spell resistance or a successful saving throw), as a swift action, you can redirect the spell-like ability to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell-like ability behaves as if its new target were the original target for the spell-like ability. Spell-like abilities that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) can't be redirected in this manner. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) -1. For a summary, see Table 3-1. [Special] This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
Brutal Coup de Grace						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dazzling Display,Weapon Focus																																																																															PRETEXT:Proficiency with the selected weapon.																																																																																															PRETOTALAB:5										DESC:Your killing blows are so brutal that they scare other foes.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:When you deliver a coup de grace with the selected weapon and kill the target, enemies within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC %1) or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+TL/2+CHA
Brute Assault							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brute Stomp,Brute Style																																																																																																																																																																																						PRETOTALAB:10	PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_STR,23,PreStatScore_INT,13	DESC:With brute force, you can bowl over and cripple opponents by treading on them.																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:While using Brute Style, when you successfully perform an overrun or trip combat maneuver against an opponent that causes that opponent to fall prone, your opponent takes 1d6 points of Strength damage, and its base speed is halved until the Strength damage is healed. A successful Fortitude save (DC %1) reduces the Strength damage to 1 point and negates the movement speed reduction.|10+BAB
Brute Stomp								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brute Style																																																																																																																																																																																								PRETOTALAB:8	PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_STR,19,PreStatScore_INT,13	DESC:Few can avoid the brutal violence of your bone-crushing kicks and stomps.																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:While using Brute Style, when you make a full attack with a prone opponent adjacent to you that includes at least one unarmed strike, you can make an additional unarmed strike at your highest base attack bonus against that prone creature. These additional attacks don't stack with those granted by Medusa's Wrath, and this does not allow you to make an additional attack against a creature you tripped during your full attack. Additionally, you can use your Vicious Stomp feat against any opponent within your natural reach regardless of whether it falls prone adjacent to you.
Brute Style								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style		PREABILITY:5,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes,Improved Overrun,Improved Trip,Improved Unarmed Strike,Vicious Stomp																																																																																																																																																																												PRETOTALAB:6	PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_STR,15,PreStatScore_INT,13	DESC:Through strength, study, and intense inner reflection, you have become an expert at battering fallen opponents.																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:While using this style, you can use your Vicious Stomp feat against any opponent within 10 feet of you, as long as it is within your natural reach. If you don't have the Vicious Stomp feat, you gain no benefit from this feat. [Normal] The Vicious Stomp feat only works against an opponent that falls prone adjacent to you.
Bully Breed								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Animal Companion,TYPE.Special Mount,TYPE.Mount																																																			PRESKILL:2,Handle Animal=4,Intimidate=4																																																																																																																																			DESC:Your animal companion can terrify as well as fight.																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:Your animal companion or mount gains Intimidate as a class skill. It can attempt to demoralize an opponent using the Intimidate skill as a move action on the same round that it damages an opponent with a natural attack. [Special] Your animal companion can select the Dazzling Display and Shatter Defenses feats if it meets the prerequisites. This feat does not allow your animal companion to use Intimidate to make a target friendly or gain their assistance. [Normal] Animal companions and mounts with an Intelligence score of 2 or less must select feats from a limited list.
Clarity of Pain							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Iron Will,Iron Will																																																																																																																																																																																								PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,13				DESC:You can inflict pain upon yourself to sharpen your focus.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:Three times per day, as an immediate action when you fail a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, you can inflict 1d6 points of slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage to yourself in order to reroll that saving throw. You can't reroll the saving throw if you negate the damage, such as by having damage reduction greater than or equal to the damage you dealt to yourself; instead, you spend the immediate action and daily use of this feat but gain no benefit. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.
Consume Essence							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Monster	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Swallow Whole																		PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE																					PRERACE:2,RACETYPE=Magical Beast,RACESUBTYPE=Outsider,RACESUBTYPE=Undead																																																																																																																																	PRETOTALAB:6										DESC:Creatures that you swallow are quickly absorbed and soon utterly annihilated.																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:When you start your turn having swallowed at least one creature, each swallowed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or gain a temporary negative level. Swallowed creatures that die from these negative levels are consumed as per disintegrate. This is a death effect. [Special] If you are of the undead type, each time a swallowed creature gains a temporary negative level from this ability, you add 5 temporary hit points to the number of hit points that swallowed creatures must deal to escape, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.|10+TL/2+CHA
Contagious Spell							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																																																												DESC:Your spells are dangerous to dispel and likely to backfire upon those who try.																																																																																																																																																																																			ADDSPELLLEVEL:2							SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:A caster level check to dispel or remove a contagious spell that fails by 5 or more causes it to spread from the original target to the creature that attempted to remove it. The spell spreads to the new target regardless of its normal range or any special targeting requirement like a melee or ranged touch attack. The spell is treated as if you had just cast it on the new target. The new target receives a saving throw or the benefit of spell resistance (if applicable) if the spell normally allows it. You can apply Contagious Spell only to targeted spells that are harmful to their target and don't have a range of personal; a contagious spell never spreads to someone who would benefit from being the target of the spell. A contagious spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level. [Special] A contagious spell can be identified normally as it is being cast with a successful Spellcraft check. Identifying whether a spell is contagious by its effect, however, requires the use of the analyze dweomer spell or a similar effect.
Deadhand Initiate							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deadhand Style																																																											PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=6																																																																																																																											PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_WIS,19				DESC:Your adulation of death not only shields you from your fears, it allows you to feed on them.																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:While using Deadhand Style, as long as you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, your bonus on saving throws against fear effects increases to +4, and the DC of Intimidate checks attempted against you increases by 8. Additionally, if an enemy targets you with a fear effect, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool as an immediate action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your Hit Dice.
Deadhand Master							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deadhand Initiate																																																										PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=14																																																																																																																											PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_WIS,23				DESC:Your death-infused punch drains life force from your foes.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:While using Deadhand Style, when you damage a living creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 points from your ki pool as a swift action to inflict 2 temporary negative levels on your enemy with no saving throw. Effects that reduce the ki cost also reduce the number of negative levels you inflict on your foe, but effects that increase the ki cost do not increase the number of negative levels you inflict. As long as the foe is affected by the temporary negative levels, you can't recover the ki points you spent, effectively reducing the size of your ki pool. The Fortitude save DC to remove the negative levels and prevent them from becoming permanent is %1. Once the negative levels become permanent or the foe removes them, you can recover your spent ki points. If the foe dies before either happens, you can recover the spent ki after 24 hours.|10+TL/2+WIS
Deadhand Style							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool									PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE,LN,TN,CN																																			PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=4																																																																																																																											PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_WIS,15				DESC:Your study of death allow you to exploit your foes' fears.

As a swift action, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to empower your unarmed strikes. Creatures hit with your unarmed strikes must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) or become shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+TL/2+WIS
Disconcerting Knowledge						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Knowledge],[PREVARGTEQ:DomainKnowledgeLVL,1]																	PRESKILL:2,TYPE.Knowledge=3,TYPE.Knowledge=3																																																																																																																																		DESC:You unsettle your enemies by demonstrating that you how to defeat them.																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:You can use your knowledge to demoralize an enemy. When you use a standard action to Intimidate a creature with a base CR of 2 or greater, you can use a Knowledge skill that could be used to identify the creature's type in place of Intimidate when attempting to demoralize that creature. The target creature must be intelligent and understand the language that you are using when conveying the disconcerting knowledge.
Disrupting Fist							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Channel Smite,Improved Unarmed Strike																																																																														PRETEXT:Channel positive energy 4d6.

Disruptive Spell-Like Ability					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Monster																																																																																										PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.																																																																																																									DESC:Your spell-like ability clings to affected targets and interferes with their spellcasting.																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.85	BENEFIT:Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a disruptive spell-like ability up to three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). For 1 round after you use a disruptive spell-like ability, affected targets attempting to cast as spell must attempt concentration checks when casting spells or use spell-like abilities (DC = the disruptive spell-like ability's DC + the level of the spell the target is casting or spell-like ability it's using). Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects also avoid this feat's effect. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1. (page 79) [Special] This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you do, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
Engulf Horror							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Monster	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Engulf Revulsion	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Engulf,Smother																																																																																																																																																																																										DESC:The repulsive horror of your smothering attack nearly incapacitates most foes.																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:When you successfully engulf or smother an opponent, successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on a smothered opponent, the opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) or become staggered for 1 round.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+TL/2+STR
Exorcising Mutilation						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Clarity of Pain																																																																																																																																																																																										PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,15				DESC:Malevolent entities that seek to possess or dominate you are unaware of how far you will go to stop them.																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:When you fail a saving throw to resist possession or a dominate spell, you can deal 4 points of Constitution damage to yourself and reroll your saving throw as an immediate action. You cannot reduce or negate this damage in any way, and the only way to heal the damage is through natural recovery; magical methods don't work. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. If you succeed at the second saving throw, you also become immune to that spell or ability from that creature for 24 hours. You must be wielding a lethal piercing or slashing weapon, or possess a claw natural attack or some way to draw such a weapon reactively without using your immediate action, to use this ability.
Exsanguinate							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Monster	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Grab,Blood Drain																																																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:You drink blood from the living at a furious rate, often draining creatures dry in a matter of seconds.																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Once per round, when you successfully pin an opponent, that opponent takes double the normal damage from your blood drain.
Fear Eater								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Iron Will																																																																																		PRETEXT:Have no immunity to fear effects.																																																																																																			PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CHA,13				DESC:You eat the fear of others, freeing them from its effects.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can remove a fear effect from another creature by touching it. The fear effect is transferred from that creature to you, with the same remaining duration. If the fear effect has varying effects depending on the target (such as the effects of cause fear depending on the target's Hit Dice), it has the effect it had on the original creature or the effect it would have on you, whichever is more severe. When you choose to accept another creature's fear, you don't receive any saving throw, spell resistance, or other defenses you would normally have against the fear effect.
Fearsome Spell-Like Ability					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Monster																																																																																										PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.																																																																																																									DESC:Your spell-like ability induces fear in affected targets.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a fearsome spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable once or twice per day). When a target takes damage from a fearsome spelllike ability and fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell-like ability's equivalent spell level. If the spell-like ability doesn't allow a saving throw, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the DC that the spell-like ability would have if it allowed a saving throw) to negate the shaken effect. If the effect of the spell-like ability also causes targets to become shaken and a target fails its saving throw, the duration of the shaken condition caused by this effect stacks with the spell-like ability's. A fearsome spelllike ability can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) -2. For a summary, see Table 3-1. (page 79) [Special] This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.

Gruesome Shapechanger						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Monster																																																			PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Shapechanger																																																																																																																																																				DESC:When you change shape, it is a violent and bloody affair.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:When you change shape, your previous form sloughs off your body in a spray of blood and viscera that congeals into a thick, disgusting slime that dissolves within 24 hours. Until the slime dissolves or is cleaned in some way, the space where you stood when you changed (or the space below if you changed in mid-air) becomes slippery, counting as difficult terrain and increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks made in that area by 5. Any foe witnessing this gruesome shape change must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or be sickened for 1 minute. [Special] The gruesome way you change shape is tiring. Once you've used your change shape ability, you must wait 1d4 rounds before you can use it again. If you take this feat, it changes the way your shapechanging ability works; you cannot choose to avoid this feat's effects.|10+TL/2+CON
Horrific Gorging							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Monster	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Swallow Whole	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Bite																																																PRESIZEGTEQ:L																																																																																																																																										DESC:In the space of a few horrific seconds, you can chew up and gulp down an entire humanoid body.																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can completely consume a dead, unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise helpless humanoid creature that you could normally swallow with your swallow whole ability. When you do, you deal bite damage as a critical hit and swallow the humanoid as your swallow whole special ability. Allies of the swallowed creature within 30 feet that can see you indulge in this horrific feast must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) to avoid being shaken for 1d4 rounds. This part of the ability is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+TL/2+CHA
Incorporeal Intuition						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spirit Sense																									PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psychic Sensitivity],[PRESPELLCAST:TYPE=Psychic]																																																																																																																																																													DESC:You notice incorporeal creatures, even those lurking in walls.																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:You can sense the presence and movement of incorporeal creatures though solid walls, as long as that incorporeal creature is adjacent to you. When you sense a creature in this way, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to identify the creature and its special powers or vulnerabilities, with a -5 penalty. When you sense an incorporeal creature with this ability and use a readied action to attack it when it attacks from inside the wall, it doesn't gain cover against your attack. [Normal] Incorporeal creatures are silent unless they choose to make a sound and are thus almost impossible to detect when inside a solid wall. When readying to attack an incorporeal creature in a solid wall, it gains cover against your attack.
Intensified Spell-Like Ability				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Monster																																																																																										PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.																																																																																																									DESC:Your spell-like ability deals more damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as an intensified spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use an intensified spell-like ability, the maximum number of the ability's damage dice increases by 5 levels. You must have sufficient caster levels to surpass the normal maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell-like ability are affected, and spell-like abilities that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1, page 79. [Special] This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.

SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:When using Kyton Style, your spiked chain attacks can be brutal, both to yourself and your foe. Before attempting an attack roll with a spiked chain attack, you can choose to make a Kyton Cut. Before making the attack, you take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This damage cannot be avoided or reduced in any way. If you are immune to nonlethal damage, you take normal damage instead. If the attack hits, its target takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and a -4 penalty on concentration checks for 1 round. The penalty is a pain effect.

SOURCEPAGE:p.88	BENEFIT:When using Kyton Style, you gain a +1 shield bonus to your Armor Class as long as you are wielding a spiked chain. If the spiked chain is magical, add 1/2 its enhancement bonus to this shield bonus. If the spiked chain has the vicious ability, instead add its full enhancement bonus to the shield bonus.
Kyton Style								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Chain (Spiked))	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool																																													PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (planes)=3																																																																																																																											PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_WIS,13				DESC:Your fighting style emulates the disciplined nature of the kytons, with passion and pain held tightly in chains.																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.89	BENEFIT:When using this style, you treat spiked chains as if they had the monk special weapon feature. Additionally, if you have Stunning Fist, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to make a Stunning Fist attack with your spiked chain instead of an unarmed strike. This still costs a use of Stunning Fist as normal.
Latching Horror							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Monster																																																																																									PRETEXT:Attach universal monster ability.																																																																																																												DESC:You induce fear and loathing when you latch onto another living creature.																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.89	BENEFIT:When you use your attach ability, your opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) to avoid becoming shaken while you remain attached.

Additionally, if a humanoid creature attempts to read your mind using an ability like detect thoughts, it is shaken for 2d4 rounds regardless of whether the mind-reading attempt succeeds. If a humanoid fails a Diplomacy check against you by 5 or more, it becomes shaken for 2d4 rounds by your emotionless gaze.
Lingering Spell-Like Ability					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Monster																																																																																										PRETEXT:Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a lingering spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). A lingering spell-like ability causes an instantaneous spell-like ability that affects an area to persist until the beginning of its next turn. Targets already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A lingering spell-like ability with a visual manifestation obscures vision, providing concealment (20%% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50%% miss chance) beyond 20 feet. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1 on p79.

You can't reduce or ignore this damage in any way. This damage doesn't disrupt the ritual, and you can roll twice for the next skill check made as part of a ritual casting and take the better result. If the resulting ritual effect has the fear descriptor or is in the phantasm subschool, increase its saving throw DC by 1. Multiple characters with this feat can each use it once per ritual on their skill checks, but the DC increases don't stack.

SOURCEPAGE:p.91	BENEFIT:As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can attempt to end an ingested poison effect by making yourself vomit. If you succeed at a new saving throw against the initial effect, you gain the nauseated condition for 1 round but end the poison effect as if you had succeeded at the requisite saving throws. Your vomiting causes one adjacent square to become slippery (Core Rulebook 412) until your vomit is cleaned (usually taking 1 full round) or dries up (usually 1 hour). Once you use this feat, you must wait at least 1 hour and consume food or drink before you can use it again.

The duration of the sickened condition created by this stench is a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. When performing a putrid summon, you summon a creature from the next lower list than the spell you are casting. For instance, if you cast summon monster IV, you summon a creature from the summon monster III list.

You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a reach spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a reach spell-like ability, it can alter a spell-like ability with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. You can select a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell only if its level is less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 1 per increase in range category. For example, a spell-like ability with a range of touch can be increased to long range only if it duplicates a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 3. For a summary, see Table 3-3 on p92. Reach spell-like abilities that normally require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks. Spell-like abilities that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat. [Special] This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.

Your sacrifice must be a sentient creature with a total number of Hit Dice greater than or equal to your caster level, and it must die from your coup de grace; if it doesn't die or comes back to life, you lose all benefits related to that sacrifice. After successfully performing the ritual, you choose the spell that the ritual enhances and gain your choice of a +2 bonus to any attack rolls and combat maneuvers made with that spell or a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with that spell for 24 hours. You can perform this ritual %1 times per day, but you cannot affect the same spell more than once at a time.|CHA

When you begin the occult ritual with the death of a sentient creature (or number of sentient creatures with a total number of Hit Dice equal to twice the effective level of the ritual), you and all secondary casters gain a +4 bonus on all skill checks necessary to complete the occult ritual.

You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a scarring spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a scarring spell-like ability, a target that fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against emotion and fear effects you create, and a -1 penalty on saving throws against other emotion and fear effects, for the next 24 hours. If the spell-like ability doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't choose to enhance it with this feat. Penalties from multiple scarring spell-like abilities don't stack. This feat can be applied only to spell-like abilities with the emotion or fear descriptor. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1 on p79.

If the attack is successful, you deal your normal damage with the melee or ranged attack to your undead target. If the target undead creature is being controlled by another, by way of spell, because the target undead creature is an unintelligent undead controlled by that creature, or is under command of another undead creature, and if the controlling creature is within 120 feet of you when you make the attack, the controlling creature must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) or immediately lose control of the targeted undead for 10 minutes. While under this effect, the targeted undead is immediately compelled to seek out and attack its former controller until the control is regained.|10+TL/2+CHA

You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a sickening spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a sickening spell-like ability, a target that takes damage from the spell-like ability becomes sickened for a number of rounds equal to the spell-like ability's equivalent spell level. If the spell-like ability allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Fortitude save (against the DC that the spell-like ability would have if it allowed a saving throw) to negate the sickening effect. If the effect of the spell-like ability also causes targets to become sickened and targets fail their save, add the duration of the sickened condition caused by this effect to the duration of the sickened condition imposed by the spell-like ability. Spell-like abilities that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1 on p79.

PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_INT,7					DESC:During the daylight hours, you can cloak your unnatural form beneath a veil of flesh and blood.																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.93	BENEFIT:Once per day as a full-round action, you can cloak your body in a thin, fleshy suit that gives you the appearance of yourself as a young adult humanoid. Your appearance changes as per alter self, but this feat doesn't adjust your ability scores or grant any new abilities. When so disguised, you cannot use slashing or piercing natural attacks, such as bite or claw attacks, without unraveling and destroying your skin suit, nor can you deliver energy drain or ability damage with your undead special attacks (such as a wight or vampire's slam attacks) without destroying the suit. While wearing a skin suit, your alignment is masked as though by a constant undetectable alignment spell, and you have the aura of a living creature instead of an undead creature for the purposes of detect undead and similar effects. The skin suit dissolves into a puddle of bloody slurry at sundown, though you can remove it at any time as a standard action. The skin suit does not protect you from the effects of being exposed to direct sunlight. Finally, if you take lethal damage while wearing your skin suit, you must succeed at a Reflex save with a DC equal to the amount of lethal damage or the skin suit is destroyed.

PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_INT,13				DESC:You can see through the eyes of your spawned minions.																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can create a link with one of your spawn that you control on the same plane. When you do so, your spawn's eyes glow bright red. When linked in this way, you can see through your spawn's eyes with either the spawn's vision or yours, whichever is more beneficial. While looking through your spawn's eyes, your body is blinded. You can also speak though your spawn (if it can speak), using your own voice. You can maintain this link each round as a standard action as if concentrating to maintain a 3rd-level spell. If your spawn is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points while you use this ability, you become linded and dazed for 1d6 rounds with no saving throw.

SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:When you absorb a spirit with the Absorb Spirit feat, you can converse with it through an internal dialogue in your mind. While conversing with the spirit, you can attempt Diplomacy checks to change its attitude toward you, as a normal use of that skill. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature, you gain a +4 bonuson these Diplomacy checks. Once the spirit's attitude is indifferent or better, you can request to know what must be done to lay the spirit to rest, though the DC to do so is the DC to change its current attitude + 15. This takes into account the circumstance modifiers for the request in a typical situation, though it could be higher or lower in an unusual circumstance. The spirit's starting attitude is usually hostile since you destroyed it and imprisoned it within you, interfering with its rejuvenation. If it's the spirit of an undead creature, it has the same Charisma bonus it had while fully manifested. If the spirit is that of a haunt, it has an effective Charisma based on its CR using the following table. CR 1-4 = Cha 12 (+1); CR 5-8 = Cha 16 (+3); CR 9-12 = Cha 20 (+5); CR 13-16 = Cha 24 (+7); CR 17-20 = Cha 28 (+9); CR 21+ = Cha 32 (+11); Conversing with a spirit in this manner unsettles the mind.

You can attempt an opposed Sleight of Hand check against the target's Perception to make this attack without the target noticing. If the attack hits, the target gets a Will save (DC %1). On a failed save, you implant a suggestion into the creature's mind. This works similar to the suggestion spell, however, you can suggest to the creature to commit a harmful or destructive act against another creature or object. If you choose the latter, the creature attempts to carry out the suggestion in 1d6+1 days as it thinks over the suggestion and plans it out.

SOURCEPAGE:p.95	BENEFIT:Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a traumatic spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use a traumatic spell-like ability, affected targets must succeed at an additional Will saving throw the next time that they sleep (DC = the spell-like ability's DC) or be affected as per nightmare. Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another nightmare, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first. This feat can be applied only to spell-like abilities with the emotion or fear descriptor. Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects avoid this feat's effect as well. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1 on p79. [Special] This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you are able to apply it to a different spell-like ability.

SOURCEPAGE:p.95	BENEFIT:When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, if you remain conscious from your ferocity monster ability, you can make a full attack on your next turn (or your current turn if you are reduced to 0 hit points on your own turn). If you do, you push your body to the point that your mind becomes more primitive, and you can no longer use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, or Ride, or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting) until your hit points are raised above 0. [Normal] When using the ferocity ability, you are staggered while you have fewer than 0 hit points and thus can't make a full attack.

This bonus stacks with itself and with the bonus granted by Unimpeachable Honor.

##Story Feats
Enemy Cult								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story																																																																																											PRETEXT:You must have encountered a cult whose general alignment is opposite to yours on at least one axis or who threatened your beliefs or way of life, or you must have the Angelic Encounter, the False Witness, The Omen, or the Terrible Secret background (all of which are found in Ultimate Campaign).

SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Choose an appropriate detect chaos/evil/good/law spell that would aid you in opposing your chosen enemy cult. You can cast this spell twice per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. [Goal] Thwart the enemy cult, whose leader must be a challenging foe. You must deal that cult leader a decisive defeat, and additionally eradicate the cult or drive the cult from the area. [Completion Benefit] You gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against evil creatures and a +2 deflection bonus to AC against evil creatures' attacks. These bonuses double against evil summoned creatures.
Ghost Guide								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story																																																																																											PRETEXT:You have encountered a ghost or haunt, or have the Bones, the Died, the Raised Among the Dead, or The Dead One background (all of which are found in Ultimate Campaign).																																																																																					DESC:You have made it your life's work to put the dead to rest.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Whenever you communicate with a ghost or haunt, whether while adventuring or through use of spells such as call spirit, speak with haunt, and speak with dead, or seances and talking boards, you gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. The GM can also extend this benefit to any intelligent undead creature that has an interest in being laid to rest. If you have more than 10 ranks in either these skills, you instead gain a +4 bonus on the appropriate skill. [Goal] Lay an appropriate number of ghosts, haunts, and other undead creatures to rest. Laying to rest means fulfilling the actions described on a haunt's destruction line or doing what is required to prevent a ghost's rejuvenation. If the GM includes other types of undead, the GM decides what constitutes their final business. [Completion Benefits] You retain the normal benefit. Additionally, you increase your effective caster level by 2 when determining the effects of call spirit, speak with haunt, speak with dead. Finally, when a spirit lies to you, you can confront the spirit about the lie and force it to roll another saving throw against the spell's DC. If the spirit fails the saving throw, you receive an additional question to replace the one where the spirit gave a false answer.
Protector of the People						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story																																																																																											PRETEXT:Your community has come under persecution and requires considerable defense, or you have the Raiders, the Righting a Wrong, The War, or The Way Things Work background (all of which are found in Ultimate Campaign).																																																																														DESC:You have vowed to construct a defender for your community.																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.91	BENEFIT:You temporarily gain the Craft Construct feat for the purposes of building one golem to satisfy the goal of this story feat. You do not need to meet Craft Construct's prerequisites, and it can't be used as a prerequisite for any other crafting endeavor. [Goal] Craft a golem of CR 5 or greater and donate it to your community for its defense against persecution. You and your allies must fund the construction, not the community. You must be significantly involved in the golem's construction. After completion, this golem cannot be used as a personal adventuring companion; it is the property of the community to which it was dedicated. The donated creature must be a golem and not another type of construct, such as an animated object. [Completion Benefits] You gain Craft Construct as a bonus feat without meeting its prerequisites and can use it for any purpose. The cost to build any construct that normally costs less than the cost of your donated golem is permanently reduced by 10%%; the cost of the base materials is not reduced, however.
Twisted Love							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Story																																																																																											PRETEXT:You resemble a lost loved one of an evil creature who would otherwise be a challenging foe. The likeness is close enough for you to be mistaken as the former loved one's reincarnation, or you might be that loved one reborn in a new life. Alternately, the creature might be a former lover who has become evil and wishes to resume the relationship. This unwanted relationship must be contrary to your alignment or long-term goals. Thematically appropriate backgrounds include Born out of Time, Current Lover, Reincarnated, The Lover, and Troubled First Love (all of which are found in Ultimate Campaign).													DESC:An evil person or entity has become obsessed with your resemblance to a lost loved one.																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.95	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to influence your would-be love or her minions and servants. [Goal] You must break the heart of your pursuer in a dramatic and significant manner. This requires you to interact closely and frequently enough with the entity to cause her to become emotionally compromised or vulnerable. A simple rebuff or refusal of her affections is insufficient to satisfy this goal and might only further drive the obsessed creature to capture you, cast charm spells upon you, corrupt you, or transform you in a way that would make you more sympathetic to her. [Completion Benefit] You retain your +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If you succeed at a Will save against such an effect, the caster does not learn that you succeeded at your saving throw (effects such as detect magic and analyze dweomer still work normally). However, this benefit doesn't inform you of the nature of the effect cast upon you. The spurned entity might later seek revenge for the humiliation but is no longer obsessed with you. You also receive the completion benefit even if the formerly obsessed entity is slain, though you never receive the benefit if the entity perishes before you can achieve your goal.
