Mad Genius				KEY:Mad Scientist ~ Mad Genius			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MadScientistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																						SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:A mad scientist can deal	DESC:1d3 points of Wisdom|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:1d6 points of sanity|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:damage to herself to create a genius extract as one of her daily 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-level extracts. This otherwise takes the same amount of time and effort as creating a normal extract of its level, but instead of her choosing a formula she knows for it to grant, a genius extract has an unpredictable result. When the alchemist (or an ally, if she has the infusion discovery) drinks the extract, it produces a random effect from the list of alchemist formulae on page 32 of the Advanced Player's Guide of 1 spell level higher than the extract's spell level. For instance, if she creates a genius extract using a 2nd-level extract, it would produce the effect of a random 3rd-level alchemist formula. There is no way to predict which effect a genius extract will produce before drinking it. A genius extract's minimum caster level is equal to the minimum caster level of the extract used, not the effect produced. So, for instance, a genius extract that produced a fox's cunning effect would have a minimum caster level of 1 (for the 1st-level extract used) rather than 4 (for the 2nd-level effect). There are 29 potential 2nd-level extracts, 23 potential 3rd-level extracts, 18 potential 4th-level extracts, 15 potential 5th-level extracts, and 15 potential 6th-level extracts. This ability alters alchemy.
Mad Mutagen				KEY:Mad Scientist ~ Mad Mutagen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MadScientistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																						SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:A mad scientist can brew a mad mutagen in place of a normal mutagen. If she does so, she need not make any decisions about the mutagen (including whether to make it a cognatogen or another variant mutagen if she has the appropriate discoveries) when she brews it. When the mad scientist drinks her mad mutagen, she makes those decisions on the fly, but she also takes	DESC:1d4 points of Wisdom|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:1d8 points of sanity|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:damage. If anyone else, even another alchemist, drinks a mad mutagen, that person must succeed at a Will save (with the same DC as for the Fortitude save against nausea) or she becomes confused for 1 hour. This ability alters the alchemist's mutagen.

Cult Totem				KEY:Rage Power ~ Cult Totem				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage Power ~ Cult Totem (Lesser)			PREVARGTEQ:RagePowersLVL,6			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:The barbarian can make an attack of opportunity against a creature within her reach who damages an ally of the barbarian with a melee attack. Only the enemy, not the barbarian's ally, needs to be within the barbarian's melee reach in order for the barbarian to make this attack of opportunity. Once the barbarian makes an attack of opportunity against a creature with this ability, she can't use this ability to make an attack of opportunity against the same creature for 24 hours.
Cult Totem, Greater		KEY:Rage Power ~ Cult Totem (Greater)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage Power ~ Cult Totem				PREVARGTEQ:RagePowersLVL,10			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:While the barbarian is raging, when she takes hit point damage that would render her dying or dead, she remains conscious and raging until the end of her next turn after taking that damage, though she is disabled during that turn. She becomes dying or dead at the end of her next turn as normal for her current hit point total. This ability has no effect if the barbarian dies from a cause other than hit point damage, such as from a death effect or if her Constitution damage exceeds her Constitution score.
Cult Totem, Lesser		KEY:Rage Power ~ Cult Totem (Lesser)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																						SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:While the barbarian is raging, any morale bonuses or bonuses for flanking she gains on attacks rolls are added to her damage rolls instead of her attack rolls. They are still morale bonuses, and they don't stack with other morale bonuses on damage rolls.
Daemon Totem			KEY:Rage Power ~ Daemon Totem				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage Power ~ Daemon Totem (Lesser)		PREVARGTEQ:RagePowersLVL,6			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:While the barbarian is raging, her melee attacks impose a temporary negative level on her opponent on a successful critical hit. After 1 hour, these temporary negative levels disappear automatically (without a saving throw).		BONUS:VAR|DaemonTotemResistance|1

If she is already at her maximum number of hit points, she instead gains 5 temporary hit points, which don't stack if she kills multiple creatures.		BONUS:VAR|DaemonTotemResistance|1

Fight Response			KEY:Rage Power ~ Fight Response			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																						SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:When a barbarian with this rage power attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, she can enter a rage as an immediate action (as long as she would normally be able to enter rage). This consumes 3 rounds of the barbarian's daily allotment of rage rounds, but the barbarian can maintain the rage each round on her turn normally. Any benefits from the barbarian's rage apply immediately, so she gains her bonus on Will saves against the effect that required the initial saving throw. Unlike most rage powers, this rage power's effects are useful only when the barbarian is not raging, so a skald can't grant this rage power to allies with raging song.

However, because of the fragile state of his mind, the Elder Mythos cultist takes a -2 penalty on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects.

There is no saving throw, but the target must be present and stay relatively still for the entire ritual, which typically requires a willing or restrained target. An affected humanoid's Intelligence score is instantly reduced to 2; its type changes to animal; it loses all spellcasting and abilities that require intelligence; it can't wield manufactured weapons; it gains two claw attacks and a bite attack (all dealing 1d4 points of damage for a Medium humanoid or 1d3 for Small humanoids); and it can't use skills other than Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim. An affected animal is undomesticated (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM's discretion). The devolved creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries to kill and devour other sentient humanoids.

Aura Mastery			KEY:Martyr ~ Aura Mastery				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.MartyrClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																							SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:The martyr's aura of courage, aura of resolve, and aura of righteousness have a radius of 20 feet instead of 10 feet, but the martyr does not gain immunity to fear, charms, or compulsions from those abilities. This ability alters aura of courage, aura of resolve, and aura of righteousness.
Aura of Health			KEY:Martyr ~ Aura of Health				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.MartyrClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																							SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:The martyr and all allies within 20 feet of him gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against diseases. This ability functions only when the martyr is conscious.
Martyr's Mercy			KEY:Martyr ~ Martyr's Mercy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.MartyrClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																							SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:A martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn't select that mercy (or its prerequisites). However, when he uses a mercy he didn't select, he transfers the condition to himself for the remaining duration (ignoring any immunity he might have to the condition), and he can't use this ability if he already has that condition. If he transfers a condition to himself in this way, he can't remove it from himself with a personal-only ability. The martyr can use lay on hands on any ally within 30 feet, rather than needing to touch the ally, but using lay on hands on himself is a standard action, not a swift action. This ability alters lay on hands and mercy.

#Soul Sentinel
Reprieve				KEY:Soul Sentinel ~ Reprieve				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SoulSentinelClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																						SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:A soul sentinel relieves manic and tortured souls exposed to the harsh evil of the world. When the soul sentinel uses her lay on hands ability to heal a living creature, she can remove confusion effects in place of applying one of her other mercies. If used on a creature suffering from a permanent confusion effect, this removes the effect for only 1 minute.
Sacred Soul				KEY:Soul Sentinel ~ Sacred Soul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SoulSentinelClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																						SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:A sacred soul is immune to hexes and curse spells or abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against hexes or curses. This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.
Greater Reprieve			KEY:Soul Sentinel ~ Greater Reprieve		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SoulSentinelClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																						SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:The soul sentinel suppresses the stain of corruption on the spirits of those she heals. Whenever she uses her lay on hands ability to heal a living creature (other than herself) or damage an undead creature, in place of applying one of her other mercies, she can suppress the stain from a corrupted creature's most recent manifestation for 1 minute (for more information about corruption and manifestations, see page 14). Any gift from that manifestation is unaffected and remains available, unless the manifestation has a special note requiring the gift and stain be taken together, in which case greater reprieve also suppresses the gift.

A tortured crusader uses Wisdom instead of Charisma as her key spellcasting ability score (to determine her spell DCs, bonus spells per day, bonus on concentration checks, and so on), and to determine the effects of lay on hands. This ability alters the paladin's spellcasting, smite evil, and lay on hands.

A tortured crusader doesn't gain the detect evil or divine grace class features. At 1st level, a tortured crusader gains the smite evil ability, but she doesn't add her Charisma bonus to attack rolls or a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma bonus to her AC against the target of her smite. At 2nd level, she adds a +4 bonus to attack rolls and a +4 deflection bonus to AC against the target of her smite. This ability alters smite evil.

Alone in the Dark			KEY:Tortured Crusader ~ Alone in the Dark		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.TorturedCrusaderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:Faced with endless foes, a tortured crusader can't ask others to confront the same horrors she does. She can't use her lay on hands ability to heal others or to channel energy, though starting at 4th level, she can convert two uses of lay on hands into an additional use of smite evil. Her aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness affect only her, not her allies. When she selects a divine bond, it must be with a weapon, not a mount. This ability alters lay on hands, channel energy, divine bond, aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness.
Second Chance			KEY:Tortured Crusader ~ Second Chance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.TorturedCrusaderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																					SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:Once per day, a tortured crusader can spend two uses of lay on hands and choose an unambiguous trigger such as "when I am paralyzed" or "when I am about to fall unconscious from hit point damage," as well as a mercy she knows starting at 3rd level. When the named trigger occurs, the tortured crusader gains the benefits of a lay on hands with the chosen mercy without spending an action. This healing can prevent her from falling unconscious or dying. If the effect doesn't trigger, it expires the next time the tortured crusader recovers uses of lay on hands. This ability alters lay on hands and mercy.
Last Stand				KEY:Tortured Crusader ~ Last Stand			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.TorturedCrusaderClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural																						SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:A tortured crusader can spend an additional use of smite evil when declaring a smite to make it a last stand. The duration of last stand's benefits is only 1 minute (rather than 24 hours). However, the bonus damage from smite evil is doubled on every attack (this doesn't stack with the doubling if the smite's target is an evil outsider, undead, or evil dragon). This ability replaces aura of justice.
