Mad Genius										KEY:Mad Scientist ~ Mad Genius									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MadScientistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:A mad scientist can deal	DESC:1d3 points of Wisdom|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:1d6 points of sanity|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:damage to herself to create a genius extract as one of her daily 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-level extracts. This otherwise takes the same amount of time and effort as creating a normal extract of its level, but instead of her choosing a formula she knows for it to grant, a genius extract has an unpredictable result. When the alchemist (or an ally, if she has the infusion discovery) drinks the extract, it produces a random effect from the list of alchemist formulae on page 32 of the Advanced Player's Guide of 1 spell level higher than the extract's spell level. For instance, if she creates a genius extract using a 2nd-level extract, it would produce the effect of a random 3rd-level alchemist formula. There is no way to predict which effect a genius extract will produce before drinking it. A genius extract's minimum caster level is equal to the minimum caster level of the extract used, not the effect produced. So, for instance, a genius extract that produced a fox's cunning effect would have a minimum caster level of 1 (for the 1st-level extract used) rather than 4 (for the 2nd-level effect). There are 29 potential 2nd-level extracts, 23 potential 3rd-level extracts, 18 potential 4th-level extracts, 15 potential 5th-level extracts, and 15 potential 6th-level extracts. This ability alters alchemy.

If she does so, she need not make any decisions about the mutagen (including whether to make it a cognatogen or another variant mutagen if she has the appropriate discoveries) when she brews it. When the mad scientist drinks her mad mutagen, she makes those decisions on the fly, but she also takes	DESC:1d4 points of Wisdom|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:1d8 points of sanity|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:damage. If anyone else, even another alchemist, drinks a mad mutagen, that person must succeed at a Will save (with the same DC as for the Fortitude save against nausea) or she becomes confused for 1 hour. This ability alters the alchemist's mutagen.

Only the enemy, not the barbarian's ally, needs to be within the barbarian's melee reach in order for the barbarian to make this attack of opportunity. Once the barbarian makes an attack of opportunity against a creature with this ability, she can't use this ability to make an attack of opportunity against the same creature for 24 hours.
Cult Totem, Greater		KEY:Rage Power ~ Cult Totem (Greater)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage Power ~ Cult Totem				PREVARGTEQ:RagePowersPrereqLVL,10			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:While the barbarian is raging, when she takes hit point damage that would render her dying or dead, she remains conscious and raging until the end of her next turn after taking that damage, though she is disabled during that turn. She becomes dying or dead at the end of her next turn as normal for her current hit point total. This ability has no effect if the barbarian dies from a cause other than hit point damage, such as from a death effect or if her Constitution damage exceeds her Constitution score.

They are still morale bonuses, and they don't stack with other morale bonuses on damage rolls.

Fight Response			KEY:Rage Power ~ Fight Response			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BarbarianClassFeatures.RagePower.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																						SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:When a barbarian with this rage power attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, she can enter a rage as an immediate action (as long as she would normally be able to enter rage). This consumes 3 rounds of the barbarian's daily allotment of rage rounds, but the barbarian can maintain the rage each round on her turn normally. Any benefits from the barbarian's rage apply immediately, so she gains her bonus on Will saves against the effect that required the initial saving throw. Unlike most rage powers, this rage power's effects are useful only when the barbarian is not raging, so a skald can't grant this rage power to allies with raging song.

Devolution										KEY:Devolutionist ~ Devolution									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.DevolutionistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:A devolutionist can perform a 24-hour ritual to irrevocably transform a humanoid or animal into a devolved feral state. There is no saving throw, but the target must be present and stay relatively still for the entire ritual, which typically requires a willing or restrained target. An affected humanoid's Intelligence score is instantly reduced to 2; its type changes to animal; it loses all spellcasting and abilities that require intelligence; it can't wield manufactured weapons; it gains two claw attacks and a bite attack (all dealing 1d4 points of damage for a Medium humanoid or 1d3 for Small humanoids); and it can't use skills other than Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim. An affected animal is undomesticated (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM's discretion). The devolved creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries to kill and devour other sentient humanoids. The devolutionist has no special empathy or connection with a creature she devolves, and if it was her animal companion before, it ceases to be so. The druid can communicate her desires to a devolved creature using wild empathy.

The life channeler gains one wicker talisman corresponding to each level of druid spells she can cast, starting with 1st-level spells. These talismans are initially empty, but can hold life energy.

For instance, a CR 8 creature's life energy could provide energy for a talisman holding up to a 4th-level spell. A talisman is either full or empty; it can't hold more than one creature's life energy. A life channeler can expend the energy stored in a talisman to cast her domain spell of the talisman's level without expending a spell slot.

He can use this ability only on a creature familiar to him (for example, a serial killer whose crimes the profiler has studied will suffice, even if the profiler hasn't yet identified the serial killer's true identity). To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature's Bluff modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the profiler's guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success, the profiler is able to track the creature's general movements as if using Survival to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don't apply, and this ability allows her to track a creature using pass without trace or otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many possible options for the creature to take, at the GM's discretion), if the profiler has not yet found further evidence of the creature's passing (such as footprints, fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses track of the creature's movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the creature went next by attempting another check.|PRECLASS:1,Investigator=3																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												BONUS:SKILL|Sense Motive|max(1,InvestigatorLVL/2)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.55

Martyr's Mercy									KEY:Martyr ~ Martyr's Mercy										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.MartyrClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:A martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn't select that mercy (or its prerequisites).

#Soul Sentinel
Reprieve										KEY:Soul Sentinel ~ Reprieve										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SoulSentinelClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:A soul sentinel relieves manic and tortured souls exposed to the harsh evil of the world.

Any gift from that manifestation is unaffected and remains available, unless the manifestation has a special note requiring the gift and stain be taken together, in which case greater reprieve also suppresses the gift.

A tortured crusader uses Wisdom instead of Charisma as her key spellcasting ability score (to determine her spell DCs, bonus spells per day, bonus on concentration checks, and so on), and to determine the effects of lay on hands.

At 1st level, a tortured crusader gains the smite evil ability, but she doesn't add her Charisma bonus to attack rolls or a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma bonus to her AC against the target of her smite.

She can't use her lay on hands ability to heal others or to channel energy, though starting at 4th level, she can convert two uses of lay on hands into an additional use of smite evil. Her aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness affect only her, not her allies. When she selects a divine bond, it must be with a weapon, not a mount.

Second Chance									KEY:Tortured Crusader ~ Second Chance								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.TorturedCrusaderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				DESC:Once per day, a tortured crusader can spend two uses of lay on hands and choose an unambiguous trigger such as "when I am paralyzed" or "when I am about to fall unconscious from hit point damage," as well as a mercy she knows starting at 3rd level. When the named trigger occurs, the tortured crusader gains the benefits of a lay on hands with the chosen mercy without spending an action. This healing can prevent her from falling unconscious or dying. If the effect doesn't trigger, it expires the next time the tortured crusader recovers uses of lay on hands. This ability alters lay on hands and mercy.

Last Stand										KEY:Tortured Crusader ~ Last Stand									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.TorturedCrusaderClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:A tortured crusader can spend an additional use of smite evil when declaring a smite to make it a last stand. The duration of last stand's benefits is only 1 minute (rather than 24 hours). However, the bonus damage from smite evil is doubled on every attack (this doesn't stack with the doubling if the smite's target is an evil outsider, undead, or evil dragon). This ability replaces aura of justice.
