Whip (Base).COPY=Hangman's Noose											SORTKEY:Hangman's Noose										VISIBLE:YES					EQMOD:Material ~ Rope.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|16000														QUALITY:Aura|moderate necromancy		QUALITY:Caster Level|9th	QUALITY:Slot|none	QUALITY:Construction Cost|9,301 gp	QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate rope, suffocation										SPROP:As a standard action, the wielder can attempt a combat maneuver check to wrap the whip around a creature' s neck, allowing wielder to attempt a reposition maneuver or to strangle target										DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:This +1 whip is made from a hemp rope that once served as the noose in a gallows. The countless executions committed with the rope have left an indelible mark on the weapon.&nl;As a standard action, the wielder of a hangman’s noose can attempt a combat maneuver check to wrap the whip around a creature’s neck. If she succeeds, the victim can’t move outside of the whip’s reach. As a standard action, the wielder can attempt a reposition combat maneuver check to move the victim within the whip’s reach or to pull the whip tighter, strangling the victim. Once the target is being strangled, the wielder can attempt a combat maneuver check as a standard action to squeeze the air out of the victim’s lungs. This reduces the amount of time the victim can hold his breath by 1d6+1 rounds.&nl;A victim can escape the noose with a successful Escape Artist check (DC = the wielder’s CMD), or by severing the noose with an attack or a successful sunder combat maneuver check. The noose has AC 18, hardness 2, and 12 hp. If severed, the noose can still be used as a +1 whip and repairs itself after 1 hour.

If used for a drag or reposition maneuver, wielder can make attack at highest bonus as an immediate action.	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:This viciously barbed +1 spiked chain consists of a jagged hook at the end of a length of rusty chain. It twitches of its own accord, as if it had some semblance of cruel intelligence. As the wielder swings it, the chain contracts and expands with a seemingly endless supply of new links. As a free action, the wielder can cause the chain to expand, giving the weapon reach for 1 round. The weapon doesn’t threaten adjacent squares when it’s expanded. The wielder can’t reverse this change manually; he must wait for it to expire.&nl;If the wielder of a hooked massacre uses it for a drag or reposition combat maneuver that brings the target adjacent to him, he can make an attack against the target at his highest base attack bonus as an immediate action.

Dagger (Base).COPY=Sacrificial Dagger										SORTKEY:Sacrificial Dagger									VISIBLE:YES					EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|5000														QUALITY:Aura|faint necromancy [evil]	QUALITY:Caster Level|3rd	QUALITY:Slot|none	QUALITY:Construction Cost|3,802 gp	QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Magic Items and Armor, death knell												SPROP:1/day, killing a creature with a coup de grace grants wielder effects of death knell for 10 min/HD of slain creature																					DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:The serrated blade of this +1 dagger is set in a hilt made of human bone carved in the shape of a scorpion’s tail. Once per day when the wielder delivers a coup de grace with the sacrificial dagger and the target dies as a result of the attack, the dagger traps the dead creature’s life energy for 10 minutes per Hit Die of the creature. A dark mist visibly seeps from the dagger during this time, and anyone wielding the dagger gains the benefits of death knell. Determine the number of temporary hit points granted when the target dies. The temporary hit points stem from the dagger, so if another creature wields the dagger, that creature gains the remaining temporary hit points (if any) and the previous wielder loses them.&nl;If, while the death knell effect is active, the wielder casts a spell that requires sacrificing a creature, she can expend the life energy stored in the dagger. For the purpose of fulfilling the spell’s requirements, the life energy counts as the creature did when it was alive (including Hit Dice and whether or not it was sentient). Expending the trapped life energy ends the death knell effect immediately, before the casting of the sacrificial spell is complete, so the death knell effect doesn’t increase the wielder’s caster level for that spell. Sacrificing another creature dissipates the life energy of any previous sacrifice already held in the dagger.

Longsword (Base).COPY=Screaming Blade										SORTKEY:Screaming Blade										VISIBLE:YES					EQMOD:Material ~ Steel.Special Ability ~ +2 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Enhancement Cost|13000														QUALITY:Aura|moderate evocation [evil]	QUALITY:Caster Level|10th	QUALITY:Slot|none	QUALITY:Construction Cost|12,815 gp	QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Magic Arms and Armor, sound burst, creator must be evil and torture a sentient creature during creation	SPROP:Creatures other than wielder within 60 feet need a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast as spell, they take -2 on skill chacks needing concentration, and cannot take 10 due to distraction.							DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:This +2 longsword contains the hideous captured screams of a torture victim. The blade howls these blasphemies and profanities whenever it is drawn. This discordant noise grants the wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks, but any creature can hear the howls with a Perception DC of –10, regardless of the wielder’s Stealth.&nl;The disturbing noise makes it difficult for nearby creatures to concentrate. Any creature other than the wielder within 60 feet attempting to cast a spell must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) or the spell fails. Creatures within 60 feet take a –2 penalty on skill checks that require concentration and are unable to take 10 (unless they have an ability that enables them to take 10 while distracted or threatened). If the wielder is evil and has the bardic performance ability, she can use the screams as a masterwork instrument for either Perform (sing) or Perform (wind) and the DCs of her bardic performances that are fear effects increase by 1.&nl;Silence and similar effects suppress all the blade’s magical abilities except its enhancement bonus.
