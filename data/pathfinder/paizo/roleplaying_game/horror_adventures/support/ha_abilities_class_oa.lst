Soul Power				KEY:Dark Elementalist ~ Soul Power					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.DarkElementalistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																							SOURCEPAGE:p.56	DESC:A dark elementalist uses the souls of others to protect herself from the dangers of burn. She can't choose to accept burn if doing so would raise her total number of points of burn above 3. However, %1 times per day, as a full-round action she can gather up the soul of a sentient creature with a CR equal to or higher than her character level, as long as that creature died in the past minute. When she does, some of her existing burn is unloaded into the departing soul, racking it with unspeakable torment, but reducing her current burn total by 1 point. A soul used in this way cannot be brought back to life as if it died of a death effect. Using a soul like this doesn't heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn immediately, but does enable the dark elementalist to heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn normally.|INT	DESC:Racking a soul in this way forces anyone trying to bring the creature back to life to succeed at a caster level check (DC %1) or the attempt fails.|10+KineticistLVL|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=6|!PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16	DESC:Even if the creature returns from the dead, its soul is so damaged by the agony that it takes|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=11|!PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16	DESC:2d6 points of Wisdom damage.|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=11|!PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:3d10 points of sanity damage.|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=11|!PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Rules ~ Use Sanity	DESC:The soul is destroyed in the process, and the creature can be restored only by a miracle or wish.|PRECLASS:1,Kineticist=16	DESC: &nl;A dark elementalist gains attack and damage bonuses from elemental overflow based on how many times that day she has used soul power to rack a soul, rather than based on her current burn total. For instance, a 9th-level dark elementalist who used soul power to rack three or more souls during the course of the day would add a +3 bonus on attack rolls and a +6 bonus on damage rolls. A dark elementalist does not gain size bonuses to physical ability scores or a chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks from elemental overflow. This ability alters burn and elemental overflow.

#Psychokineticist
Emotional Intensity		KEY:Psychokineticist ~ Emotional Intensity			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.PsychokineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																					SOURCEPAGE:p.56	DESC:A psychokineticist uses his Wisdom modifier instead of his Constitution modifier to determine his damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the durations of wild talents with Constitution-based durations, his bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and other Constitution-based effects of all his wild talents. He can't use any of his wild talents whenever he would be unable to use a spell with an emotion component (see page 144 of Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures), and if he ever gains immunity to charm, compulsion, emotion effects (even if such immunity extends only to a subcategory of these effects like fear effects or compulsion effects from creatures of certain alignments), he loses all his kineticist abilities. This includes effects that he previously activated that normally last until the next time his burn is removed, like elemental defenses, though he still keeps all his penalties from burn. He can always choose to ignore such immunities when he would normally gain them, even if they are granted by another class feature (such as the paladin's aura of courage), but once he decides whether or not to ignore an immunity he would have gained, the choice cannot be changed. A psychokineticist adds Sense Motive to his list of class skills and gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat. This ability alters the kineticist's class skills and the key ability score of wild talents.

He takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, Wisdom checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for each point of burn he has accepted, rather than taking nonlethal damage from burn. He can accept an amount of burn equal to his Wisdom modifier (rather than 3 + his Wisdom modifier). Otherwise, his burn works just like a normal kineticist's. This ability alters burn.
Mental Overflow			KEY:Psychokineticist ~ Mental Overflow				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.PsychokineticistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																					SOURCEPAGE:p.57	DESC:A psychokineticist's elemental energy sends strange elemental humors and planar echoes through his brain instead of reshaping his body with matter from his element. Instead of gaining size bonuses to physical ability scores from elemental overflow, he gains alchemical bonuses to his mental ability scores in equal amounts (a +2 alchemical bonus to two mental ability scores at 6th level if he has at least 3 points of burn; a +4 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score and a +2 alchemical bonus to the other two at 11th level if he has at least 5 points of burn; and a +6 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to another, and a +2 alchemical bonus to the last at 16th level if he has at least 7 points of burn). A psychokineticist doesn't gain a chance to negate critical hits and sneak attacks based on his burn. Otherwise, his elemental overflow works just like a normal kineticist's. This ability alters elemental overflow.

When he selects a haunted implement, he forsakes the resonant power from the item's implement group and instead selects a spirit from the medium's list of spirits (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 33), gaining that spirit's seance boon in place of the resonant power. He can also call upon the implement's haunting entity as a swift action to temporarily gain bonuses on all checks associated with the selected legendary spirit's spirit bonus for 1 round. This spirit bonus is equal to 1/2 the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum bonus of +%1. He can call upon this spirit bonus a number of times per day equal to the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, though invoking it doesn't expend any mental focus.

By holding a seance for 10 minutes, he can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the haunt collector must have the creature's head in his possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed.

As a	DESC:full-round|!PRECLASS:1,Occultist=16	DESC:standard action.|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=16	DESC:action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the haunt collector expends 1 point of mental focus to extricate an implement's spirit and infuse an adjacent square with its ghostly presence while granting it the power to deliver a spell from the implement's associated school (whose range is touch or greater) on the haunt collector's behalf. This action consumes the spell just as if it had been cast, but the energy is held in check by the created haunt until triggered by conditions set forth by the haunt collector. The conditions needed to trigger the haunt's spell effect must be clear, although they can be general, using the guidelines of the magic mouth spell. The haunt is stationary, and once the conditions for the trigger are met, the spell is discharged normally, though it now originates from the haunt's square.&nl; The haunt itself is an invisible, incorporeal, spectral force, similar to a stationary unseen servant with an undead aura for the purposes of spells such as detect undead. It has a number of hit points equal to the double the level of the spell used to create it + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. If triggered during the same combat it is created, the haunt acts at initiative count 10; otherwise, when the trigger occurs, the haunt initiates combat and acts at initiative count 10 on the surprise round. Other creatures must succeed at a Perception check (DC %1) to act in the surprise round. The haunt can be damaged by positive energy and anything else that can harm haunts, and if destroyed before it is triggered, it dissipates harmlessly. If the haunt is destroyed, it does not reform in its haunted implement until the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus. If the haunt doesn't trigger before the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus, the haunt dissolves at that point and reforms in its haunted implement.&nl;  The haunt collector can use this ability %2 times per day. While a haunting presence is extricated from its implement, the haunt collector does not receive the benefit of the implement's seance boon, nor can he call upon the implement's spirit bonus or use its focus powers, though he can still cast spells associated with the implement without penalty.

#Talisman Crafter
Talismanic Implements		KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Talismanic Implements			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																					SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:The talisman crafter doesn't gain normal implements; rather, after refreshing her mental focus, she spends 1 hour crafting a number of small master talismans out of cast metal, parchment, wax, or wood, inscribing them with esoteric seals and investing them with power to serve as her implements for casting occultist spells of the schools she knows. The talisman crafter selects schools as normal (two at 1st level and an additional one at 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter). She creates one master talisman for each implement school she knows, unless she selected that implement school multiple times, in which case she needs one master talisman per time she has selected that school. The talisman crafter splits her mental focus among the schools she knows and generic focus as normal. This ability alters implements.
Spellbound Talisman		KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Spellbound Talisman			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																					SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A talisman crafter can inscribe spellbound talismans in addition to her master talismans, infusing small tokens she crafts with psychic spells she knows that normally affect one or more target creatures (but not spells that target the caster, spells that affect an area, spells that create effects, or other such spells). When the occultist infuses a talisman with one of her spells, she expends the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell and expends any material components necessary. The talisman crafter can hurl this prepared talisman as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and that requires the same thought and emotion components (Occult Adventures 144) as the original spell. Even if she can normally throw objects without provoking an attack of opportunity, throwing a talisman still provokes an attack of opportunity unless she also succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. The thrown talisman has a range of 20 feet, and the occultist must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit her target. If she hits the target, the spell affects it normally, and the creature receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the spell effect. This allows the talisman crafter to deliver touch spells at range through the spellbound talisman. Alternatively, the talisman crafter can touch the talisman to a target creature as a melee touch attack (for a willing target, she automatically hits); this attack doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity as long as she succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. If an inscribed talisman's spell would normally target more than one creature, its DC increases by 2. Only a talisman crafter can activate her spellbound talismans. Once created, a spellbound talisman remains potent until the next time the talisman crafter regains spell slots before losing its magic. Inscribing a spellbound talisman in this manner takes 1 minute of work.
Shared Talisman			KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Shared Talisman				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																					SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A talisman crafter can expend 1 point of generic mental focus to create a spellbound talisman that anyone can activate. As long as the spellbound talisman exists, it continues to occupy one of the occultist's spell slots, but can be used by another creature to trigger its effects. Whoever triggers the effect, a shared talisman does not require thought or emotion components, and it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity for casting a spell (though it still does so as normal if thrown).
Warding Seal			KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Warding Seal					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																					SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A talisman crafter can inscribe a warding seal, infusing an inscribed glyph with psychic energy. Inscribing the seal follows the rules for drawing magic circles, takes 1 minute, and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of her implements). As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the talisman crafter expends 1 point of mental focus to scribe a special seal, infusing the glyph with a psychic spell she knows that affects one or more creatures and expending the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell. This seal holds the spell energy in check until it's triggered by conditions set forth when the seal is crafted or until the occultist refreshes her mental focus. The seal functions as the spell glyph option of the glyph of warding spell.	DESC:The talisman crafter's fast circles ability applies to her warding seals, and she treats the ability as the greater spell glyph option of the greater glyph of warding spell.|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=17

Merged Phantom			KEY:Exciter ~ Merged Phantom						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.ExciterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:An exciter internalizes his phantom and merges it completely within his mind. He cannot fully manifest his phantom outside of his own body in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. Emotional focus abilities that affect or require a manifested phantom are lost, except for any aura gained by the phantom at 7th level; if the phantom gains an aura at 7th level, this aura functions despite the phantom not being manifested, and is centered on the exciter. This ability alters phantom and emotional focus.

This functions similarly to a bloodrager's bloodrage (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 15), treating his spiritualist level as his bloodrager level, though he doesn't qualify for feats or other elements that require rage or bloodrage. When entering a rapture, the exciter loses all other benefits from having his phantom confined in his consciousness (such as the Skill Focus feats and bonus against mind-affecting effects), but he can choose to exchange the normal +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution scores normally gained from bloodrage for a +4 morale bonus to his Dexterity and Charisma scores or a +2 morale bonus to his Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores. In addition to the fatigue for ending a bloodrage, an exciter can't enter a rapture again for 1 minute after ending his last rapture.
