He can't use any of his wild talents whenever he would be unable to use a spell with an emotion component (see page 144 of Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures), and if he ever gains immunity to charm, compulsion, emotion effects (even if such immunity extends only to a subcategory of these effects like fear effects or compulsion effects from creatures of certain alignments), he loses all his kineticist abilities.

He can always choose to ignore such immunities when he would normally gain them, even if they are granted by another class feature (such as the paladin's aura of courage), but once he decides whether or not to ignore an immunity he would have gained, the choice cannot be changed.

The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter's Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own.

That creature doesn't realize the hate-monger has cast a spell, and considers any manifestations to be part of the touch treatment. Other creatures notice as normal.

When he selects a haunted implement, he forsakes the resonant power from the item's implement group and instead selects a spirit from the medium's list of spirits (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 33), gaining that spirit's seance boon in place of the resonant power. He can also call upon the implement's haunting entity as a swift action to temporarily gain bonuses on all checks associated with the selected legendary spirit's spirit bonus for 1 round. This spirit bonus is equal to 1/2 the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum bonus of +%1. He can call upon this spirit bonus a number of times per day equal to the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, though invoking it doesn't expend any mental focus.

By holding a seance for 10 minutes, he can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the haunt collector must have the creature's head in his possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as speak with haunt (ACG) or as speak with dead (but affecting only destroyed undead rather than only corpses), using the haunt collector's occultist level as the caster level.|(OccultistLVL-4)/4																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.62

As a	DESC:full-round|!PRECLASS:1,Occultist=16	DESC:standard action.|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=16	DESC:action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the haunt collector expends 1 point of mental focus to extricate an implement's spirit and infuse an adjacent square with its ghostly presence while granting it the power to deliver a spell from the implement's associated school (whose range is touch or greater) on the haunt collector's behalf. This action consumes the spell just as if it had been cast, but the energy is held in check by the created haunt until triggered by conditions set forth by the haunt collector. The conditions needed to trigger the haunt's spell effect must be clear, although they can be general, using the guidelines of the magic mouth spell. The haunt is stationary, and once the conditions for the trigger are met, the spell is discharged normally, though it now originates from the haunt's square.&nl; The haunt itself is an invisible, incorporeal, spectral force, similar to a stationary unseen servant with an undead aura for the purposes of spells such as detect undead. It has a number of hit points equal to the double the level of the spell used to create it + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. If triggered during the same combat it is created, the haunt acts at initiative count 10; otherwise, when the trigger occurs, the haunt initiates combat and acts at initiative count 10 on the surprise round. Other creatures must succeed at a Perception check (DC %1) to act in the surprise round. The haunt can be damaged by positive energy and anything else that can harm haunts, and if destroyed before it is triggered, it dissipates harmlessly. If the haunt is destroyed, it does not reform in its haunted implement until the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus. If the haunt doesn't trigger before the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus, the haunt dissolves at that point and reforms in its haunted implement.&nl;  The haunt collector can use this ability %2 times per day. While a haunting presence is extricated from its implement, the haunt collector does not receive the benefit of the implement's seance boon, nor can he call upon the implement's spirit bonus or use its focus powers, though he can still cast spells associated with the implement without penalty. If the spell is discharged successfully (rather than the haunt being destroyed), the spirit's presence returns to the haunt collector's implement the following round, and the seance boon and spirit bonus abilities are again available to the haunt collector.&nl; |OccultistLVL+10|1+INT	DESC:The haunt collector can create a free-roaming haunt by expending an additional point of mental focus, granting it a fly speed of 10 feet with good maneuverability, which allows it to change locations or seek targets, under the restrictions for trigger conditions as outlined above.

#Talisman Crafter
Talismanic Implements						KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Talismanic Implements			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:The talisman crafter doesn't gain normal implements; rather, after refreshing her mental focus, she spends 1 hour crafting a number of small master talismans out of cast metal, parchment, wax, or wood, inscribing them with esoteric seals and investing them with power to serve as her implements for casting occultist spells of the schools she knows. The talisman crafter selects schools as normal (two at 1st level and an additional one at 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter). She creates one master talisman for each implement school she knows, unless she selected that implement school multiple times, in which case she needs one master talisman per time she has selected that school. The talisman crafter splits her mental focus among the schools she knows and generic focus as normal. This ability alters implements.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Spellbound Talisman						KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Spellbound Talisman			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:A talisman crafter can inscribe spellbound talismans in addition to her master talismans, infusing small tokens she crafts with psychic spells she knows that normally affect one or more target creatures (but not spells that target the caster, spells that affect an area, spells that create effects, or other such spells). When the occultist infuses a talisman with one of her spells, she expends the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell and expends any material components necessary. The talisman crafter can hurl this prepared talisman as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and that requires the same thought and emotion components (Occult Adventures 144) as the original spell. Even if she can normally throw objects without provoking an attack of opportunity, throwing a talisman still provokes an attack of opportunity unless she also succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. The thrown talisman has a range of 20 feet, and the occultist must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit her target. If she hits the target, the spell affects it normally, and the creature receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the spell effect. This allows the talisman crafter to deliver touch spells at range through the spellbound talisman. Alternatively, the talisman crafter can touch the talisman to a target creature as a melee touch attack (for a willing target, she automatically hits); this attack doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity as long as she succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. If an inscribed talisman's spell would normally target more than one creature, its DC increases by 2. Only a talisman crafter can activate her spellbound talismans. Once created, a spellbound talisman remains potent until the next time the talisman crafter regains spell slots before losing its magic. Inscribing a spellbound talisman in this manner takes 1 minute of work.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Shared Talisman							KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Shared Talisman				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:A talisman crafter can expend 1 point of generic mental focus to create a spellbound talisman that anyone can activate. As long as the spellbound talisman exists, it continues to occupy one of the occultist's spell slots, but can be used by another creature to trigger its effects. Whoever triggers the effect, a shared talisman does not require thought or emotion components, and it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity for casting a spell (though it still does so as normal if thrown).

Warding Seal							KEY:Talisman Crafter ~ Warding Seal					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.TalismanCrafterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:A talisman crafter can inscribe a warding seal, infusing an inscribed glyph with psychic energy. Inscribing the seal follows the rules for drawing magic circles, takes 1 minute, and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of her implements). As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the talisman crafter expends 1 point of mental focus to scribe a special seal, infusing the glyph with a psychic spell she knows that affects one or more creatures and expending the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell. This seal holds the spell energy in check until it's triggered by conditions set forth when the seal is crafted or until the occultist refreshes her mental focus. The seal functions as the spell glyph option of the glyph of warding spell.	DESC:The talisman crafter's fast circles ability applies to her warding seals, and she treats the ability as the greater spell glyph option of the greater glyph of warding spell.|PRECLASS:1,Occultist=17																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.63

He cannot fully manifest his phantom outside of his own body in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. Emotional focus abilities that affect or require a manifested phantom are lost, except for any aura gained by the phantom at 7th level; if the phantom gains an aura at 7th level, this aura functions despite the phantom not being manifested, and is centered on the exciter.

This functions similarly to a bloodrager's bloodrage (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 15), treating his spiritualist level as his bloodrager level, though he doesn't qualify for feats or other elements that require rage or bloodrage. When entering a rapture, the exciter loses all other benefits from having his phantom confined in his consciousness (such as the Skill Focus feats and bonus against mind-affecting effects), but he can choose to exchange the normal +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution scores normally gained from bloodrage for a +4 morale bonus to his Dexterity and Charisma scores or a +2 morale bonus to his Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores.
