When an experimenter is confused, dazed, frightened, panicked, or stunned, he must attempt a Will save (DC %2) each round at the start of his turn.

While transformed in this way, he is confused, and he rerolls any result of "act normally." Since the confusion is part of the mutagenic transformation, abilities that prevent or remove confusion don't apply to this effect, though abilities that end the effect of a mutagen work normally.
