#Cursed Lord/Dread Lord
Landlocked					KEY:Dread Lord ~ Landlocked							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DreadLord				SOURCEPAGE:p.234	DESC:A dread lord's power is drawn directly from its domain, which has a radius of %1 miles, centered on a fixed point of some significance to the dread lord. The dread lord loses all benefits of this template when not within its domain.|5*TL
One with the Land				KEY:Dread Lord ~ One with the Land						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DreadLord				SOURCEPAGE:p.235	DESC:A dread lord can shape the hazardous landscapes formed as a consequence of its domain's creation to its will. It can replace any normal or supernatural hazard present in its domain with another hazard, but the process takes 24 hours, during which time neither hazard functions. The combined CR of all hazards found within a lord's domain (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) can't exceed twice its Hit Dice, and it cannot create any hazards whose CR exceeds its own. A dread lord's affinity with the land grants it a +2 bonus on all Will saves.		BONUS:SAVE|Will|2
Immortal Curse				KEY:Cursed Lord ~ Immortal Curse						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.CursedLord				SOURCEPAGE:p.235	DESC:Even death can't free a cursed lord from its domain, and cursed lords that are killed return to life 24 hours later. When a cursed lord is created, a specific condition is determined by the source of the cursed lord's curse, which must be performed in order for the cursed lord to be permanently slain. The exact means vary with each cursed lord, are difficult but never impossible, and should be created specifically for each cursed lord by the GM. Examples include disinterring the corpse of the lord's slain lover and reburying it outside the domain, stealing vast treasures from the lord's castle and returning them to the poor people they were stolen from, or destroying a dam to set free a river the cursed lord has prevented from flowing through its lands.
Trapped					KEY:Cursed Lord ~ Trapped							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.CursedLord				SOURCEPAGE:p.235	DESC:A cursed lord is unable to leave its domain by any means, and effects such as plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and even wish fail.

Dream Dominion				KEY:Dread Lord ~ Dream Dominion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.DreadLordSpecialPower			SOURCEPAGE:p.235	DESC:The dread lord has dominion over even the dreams of its subjects. It can use dream and nightmare as spell-like abilities, each once per day, but targeting only creatures within its domain.	DESC:Once per week it can attempt to gain control of a creature whose dreams it affects in this way. If the target fails a secondary Will saving throw (DC %1), the dread lord enslaves it, as per dominate monster, in addition to the dream or nightmare spell-like ability's normal effects.|10+TL/2+CHA|PREVARGTEQ:CR,9		SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=TL|Dream|Nightmare,15+CHA
Fear Aura					KEY:Dread Lord ~ Fear Aura							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.DreadLordSpecialPower.Aura		SOURCEPAGE:p.235	DESC:The dread lord is terrifying to behold. Any creature within a 60-foot radius that sees or hears the dread lord must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) or be shaken for as long as it is within the aura, and for 1 minute thereafter. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same dread lord's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+TL/2+CHA
Magical Mastery				KEY:Dread Lord ~ Magical Mastery						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DreadLordSpecialPower		SOURCEPAGE:p.235	DESC:The dread lord draws magical power from its domain. It treats its caster level as 2 higher for the purposes of spells and spell- like abilities it casts, and the saving throw DCs of such spells and spell-like abilities increase by 1.

#Familial Lich
Familial Possession			KEY:Familial Lich ~ Familial Possession					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.FamilialLich				SOURCEPAGE:p.251	DESC:When a familial lich is destroyed, its spirit departs its body and seeks out the lich's nearest living relative, a process that takes 1d10 days. The familial lich then tries to possess the relative, as per greater possession (OA) (the caster level is equal to the familial lich's HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based). If the relative succeeds at her save, she becomes permanently immune to this ability, and the familial lich must spend another 1d10 days searching for the next-nearest living relative, repeating the process until it succeeds or until no such relatives remain and it is destroyed instead. If the relative fails her saving throw, the familial lich's spirit takes root in her body. The familial lich's consciousness remains within the relative even after the greater possession effect ends, and it is able to share her senses. It can use greater possession on her once per day thereafter. If the relative fails on three consecutive saving throws to resist, the familial lich's spirit takes over, and she physically and mentally transforms into the familial lich permanently. Even if the relative continues succeeding, it is impossible to remove a familial lich without extremely powerful magic once it has taken root. Only lineal ancestors or descendants of the familial lich, as well as siblings, are eligible targets for possession (aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and so forth are immune).

#Hellbound Creature
Contract Bound				KEY:Hellbound Creature ~ Contract Bound					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.HellboundCreature			SOURCELONG:Bestiary 4	SOURCESHORT:B4	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	DESC:The creature has signed a contract of service in return for this template. The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can't hide the details of the contract in any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template's abilities, whether immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are completed. The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature's soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies, its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in Hell as one of the devil's belongings. If the devil is dead when the creature dies, the creature's soul is destroyed, and can't be restored to life except by miracle or wish. If the creature fails to perform the tasks in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not obligated to provide the promised abilities. Many contracts state that the devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature. This doesn't protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil. Breaking a contract with a devil is difficult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can't be restored to life after death except by a miracle or wish. If the devilbound creature is restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as discern location) of the creature responsible.			ASPECT:SaveBonus|+4 on saves vs. poison

#Hive Larva Swarm
Infest					KEY:Hive Larva Swarm ~ Infest							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.HiveLarvaSwarm				SOURCEPAGE:p.236	DESC:A hive larva swarm can enter the body of a single Small or larger helpless living creature. When it does so, a portion of the swarm enters a creature's mouth and gestates for 1d4 minutes. The gestated larvae ravage the host for 24 hours, during which time the infested creature falls unconscious and can't be woken by any means. During this period the larvae are vulnerable to expulsion by remove disease (DC %1). If successful, the hive larvae die inside of the host, dealing another 1d6 points of acid damage. In some cases, metabolized hive larvae corpses can infect the creature with the hive corruption (see page 24). After 24 hours, the hive larvae achieve symbiosis. The host awakens feeling healthy but hungry. Spells such as diagnose disease and Heal checks used to detect disease no longer detect the hive infestation, and the host creature is now treated as both its original creature type and an aberration for purposes of spells and effects (whichever is worse). A successful DC 25 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check can identify the symbiosis. If the host dies at this point, the larval infestation dies as well. However, if the host is then returned from the dead, the larvae are returned to life as well. The swarm fully matures 2d12 hours after symbiosis. By this point, there is no way to save the host short of a miracle or wish spell. Each round for 2d12 rounds, the host suffers agonizing pain and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or be nauseated for 1 round. On each failed save, the host takes 4d6 points of damage as the mature hive creature forcibly separates itself. At the end of the 2d12 rounds, or after the host is slain by the damage, a fully formed hive creature (usually a hive warrior) explodes from within, destroying the host's body.|10+HD/2+CON

This functions similarly to blindsight, with a range of 120 feet, except it only allows the implacable stalker to detect creatures that are currently experiencing any level of fear ranging from spooked to horrified (see page 10).

Gory Display				KEY:Implacable Stalker ~ Gory Display					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.ImplacableStalker			SOURCEPAGE:p.239	DESC:Whenever an implacable stalker kills a sentient living creature, as a swift action, it can revel in the kill, shredding its victim's corpse in a gruesome display of power. If it does, it chooses one of the following benefits -- gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity for 1 minute, regain a single use of a spell-like ability that it can normally use three or more times per day, or immediately heal a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice. Alternatively, instead of any of these benefits, the implacable stalker can cause a single creature within 60 feet to become more vulnerable to fear. Creatures affected in this way lose any immunity to fear they may have. If the creature did not possess immunity to fear, it takes a -4 penalty on saving throws to resist fear effects, and all Intimidate checks attempted against it receive a +4 circumstance bonus. These effects last for 10 minutes. Finally, if the creature is currently immune to the implacable stalker's fear aura because it succeeded at a previous saving throw, it loses that immunity.
Nightmare Resurrection			KEY:Implacable Stalker ~ Nightmare Resurrection				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ImplacableStalker			SOURCEPAGE:p.239	DESC:When an implacable stalker dies, it creates a psychic imprint on the mind of each intelligent creature within 60 feet that witnessed its death. Each week, such creatures are subject to a nightmare effect (DC %1; the normal modifiers for nightmare based on knowledge and connection do not apply). In this nightmare, the creature is hunted and slain by the implacable stalker (for GMs using the nightmare dreamscape rules on page 162, these nightmares always have the "being chased" nightmare feature). A creature that succeeds at three consecutive saving throws to resist the effect is freed from it. If any creature fails at three consecutive saving throws to resist the nightmare, the implacable stalker returns to life, as per true resurrection. If its corpse has been completely destroyed, it returns to life in a random location within 5 miles of the creature that failed to resist the nightmare effects. Once the implacable stalker is returned to life, the psychic imprint fades from all creatures still affected by it.|10+HD/2+CHA

The implacable stalker can travel a maximum distance of 480 feet with each use of this ability, and must wait 1d6 rounds between each use. Additionally, if the implacable stalker travels at least 40 feet, any shaken, frightened, or panicked creature it arrives adjacent to is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the implacable stalker's attacks until the beginning of the implacable stalker's next turn.

Creatures that succeed on this save halve the nonlethal damage and negate the staggered effect, but they still take the bleed damage. A creature that has taken nonlethal damage greater than or equal to its current hit points is not normally rendered unconscious by this ability, but such a creature is still helpless, rendering it susceptible to the apostle kyton's seductive oration ability.

Over time, typically 1 to 2 weeks, the thrall becomes a new unknown, gaining this template. The unknown can share its senses with any of its thralls (even if it changes the target of its victimize ability), and as a full-round action, it can assume control of a thrall's body, as per possession (OA) . Typically, an unknown uses this ability to keep the thrall close by until it becomes an unknown. Unknowns often use thralls to lure new victims to its lair. Psyche erosion is a mind-affecting effect.
Victimize					KEY:Unknown ~ Victimize								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.UnknownTemplate				SOURCEPAGE:p.245	DESC:As a swift action, an unknown can target a single creature within line of sight with this ability. After designating a target, the unknown can't change the target of this ability for 24 hours, or until the target dies or succeeds at its save against the unknown's psyche erosion ability. An unknown always knows the exact location of a victimized creature and the shortest route to reach it, even if it is on another plane (similar to a combined discern location and find the path); this is a divination effect and can only be prevented by mind blank and similar effects. A creature can be the target of only one unknown's victimize ability at a time, and an unknown can victimize only one creature at a time.

Assume Likeness				KEY:Unknown ~ Assume Likeness							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.UnknownTemplate			SOURCEPAGE:p.245	DESC:As a standard action while using hallucinatory camouflage, an unknown is able to disguise itself as a specific creature known to the target of its victimize ability. If the victimized creature succeeds at a Will save (DC %1) it negates this effect, and the unknown can't use this ability again for 24 hours or until it changes victims, whichever comes first. Otherwise, the unknown's features and mannerisms change to match the creature known to its victim, granting it a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate this creature. Unlike hallucinatory camouflage, this ability works against the target of victimize. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.|10+TL+CHA
Dream Movements				KEY:Unknown ~ Dream Movements							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.UnknownTemplate			SOURCEPAGE:p.245	DESC:To the unknown, all worlds are tinted with the shades of nightmares from the Dimension of Dreams, allowing them to defy the laws of physics as they move as if in a dream. An unknown gains an insight bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus. It can travel as if by dimension door as a move action at will, but only to enter or leave an area within line of sight of the target of its victimize ability. The victimized creature and the intended destination must both be within long range of the unknown.		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|CHA|TYPE=Insight
Hallucinatory Camouflage		KEY:Unknown ~ Hallucinatory Camouflage					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.UnknownTemplate			SOURCEPAGE:p.245	DESC:As long as an unknown is targeting a creature with its victimize ability, it hides its appearance behind a veil of illusions, appearing to be an unremarkable member of the victimized creature's race to everyone except the target of victimize. A successful Will save (DC %1) allows a creature that interacts with the illusion to disbelieve the effect. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.|10+TL+CHA
