# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type									Required Campaign(s)			Define									Description																																																																																																																																																																						Ability																Combat bonus											Modify VAR
Alternate Form			KEY:Colossus ~ Alternate Form				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:Colossi have the ability to transform themselves into some other shape. This transformation is nonmagical, and is not revealed by true seeing or similar magic.
Mythic Creation			KEY:Colossus ~ Mythic Creation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				PRECAMPAIGN:1,Mythic Adventures											DESC:A colossus can be created only by a creator with a mythic tier or rank equal to or greater than that of the colossus it is attempting to create.
Mythic Resilience			KEY:Colossus ~ Mythic Resilience			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				PRECAMPAIGN:1,Mythic Adventures											DESC:A colossus can expend one use of mythic power as swift action to double its damage resistance for 1 round.
Mythic Quickening			KEY:Colossus ~ Mythic Quickening			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike					PRECAMPAIGN:1,Mythic Adventures											DESC:As a swift action, a colossus can expend one use of mythic power to cast or activate one of its spell-like abilities as a free action.
Pinning Stomp			KEY:Colossus ~ Pinning Stomp				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																				DESC:When a colossus is in its normal form, as a swift action it can make a single melee attack at its highest base attack against a target three or more size categories smaller than the colossus. This attack deals an amount of damage equal to twice that of its slam attack plus 1-1/2 times the colossus's Strength bonus. If the colossus hits with this attack, it can attempt a grapple check as a free action. This grapple doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the grapple is successful, the target is pinned and takes an amount of damage equal to that of the colossus's slam attack each round at the start of the colossus's turn until either the pinned creature frees itself or the colossus moves out of the pinned creature's space. The colossus doesn't need to attempt grapple checks to continue the pin, nor can it attempt a check to move, further damage, or tie up the grappled creature. A colossus can at most have two creatures pinned with this attack at one time.
Selective Antimagic Aura	KEY:Colossus ~ Selective Antimagic Aura		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				DESC:A colossus exudes a constant antimagic field, as the spell, with a radius equal to its reach. Typically, this field ignores specified schools of magic or spell descriptors. A colossus's own spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities are not affected by this aura.
Abyssal Resurrection		KEY:Demon Lord ~ Abyssal Resurrection		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:A demon lord rules an Abyssal realm, a vast world that not only serves as its home but provides it with power. If a demon lord is slain, its body rapidly melts into corruption (leaving behind any gear it held or carried), its soul returns to a hidden location within its realm, and it is immediately restored to life (as true resurrection) at that location. Once this occurs, a demon lord can't use this ability again until a full year has passed. A demon lord realizes it is vulnerable during this time and usually doesn't risk further battles for the remainder of that year, relying on the defenses of its realm and its legions of minions to protect it. A demon lord that is slain again during this year or is killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose) is slain forever-its remains appearing somewhere deep in the Abyss among other dead demon lords from the ages. A demon lord who does not control a domain does not gain this ability.
Frightful Presence		KEY:Demon Lord ~ Frightful Presence			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				DESC:A demon lord can activate its frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, spell-like ability, special attack, or by speaking aloud.

Powerful Weaponry			KEY:Demon Lord ~ Powerful Weaponry			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																						DESC:A demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Regeneration			KEY:Demon Lord ~ Regeneration				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:Only epic and good damage, or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as an archdevil, deity, demon lord, or protean lord) interrupts a demon lord's regeneration.
Summon Demons			KEY:Demon Lord ~ Summon Demons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				DESC:Three times per day as a swift action, a demon lord can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule with a 100%% chance of success, and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.
Alien Presence			KEY:Dragon ~ Alien Presence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Aura							DEFINE:AlienPresenceRange|0	DEFINE:AlienPresenceDC|0	DESC:An outer dragon's alien presence has a range equal to 30 feet x the dragon's age category [%1'].

Starflight				KEY:Dragon ~ Starflight					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				DESC:In outer space, an outer dragon can survive in the void and fly at incredible speed. Travel times vary, but a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, and a trip beyond should take 3d20 days or more if the dragon knows the way to its destination. An outer dragon can carry one rider of one size category smaller than itself, four passengers two sizes smaller, eight passengers three sizes smaller, or 16 passengers four or more sizes smaller. Passengers are protected from the void of outer space.
Grant Spells			KEY:Empyreal Lord ~ Grant Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																						DESC:An empyreal lord can grant spells to its worshipers as if it were a deity. An empyreal lord's domains are Chaos (if chaotic), Good, Law (iflawful), and two other domains relevant to its theme and interests (or three if it is neither chaotic nor lawful). Like a deity, an empyreal lord has a favored weapon.
Improved Resistance		KEY:Empyreal Lord ~ Improved Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																						DESC:Agathion, angel, archon, or azata energy resistances are increased to 30.																																																																																																																																																										ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Resistance to Cold|Resistance to Fire|PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Azata														BONUS:VAR|ColdResistanceBonus,SonicResistanceBonus|30|TYPE=Resistance|PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Agathion	BONUS:VAR|ElectricityResistanceBonus,FireResistanceBonus|30|TYPE=Resistance|PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Angel	BONUS:VAR|ColdResistanceBonus,FireResistanceBonus|30|TYPE=Resistance|PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Azata
Powerful Weaponry			KEY:Empyreal Lord ~ Powerful Weaponry		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																						DESC:An empyreal lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he or she wields, are treated as epic and good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If the empyreal lord is chaotic or lawful, these attacks also count as that alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Primal Aura				KEY:Empyreal Lord ~ Primal Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				DESC:An aura of primeval power surrounds every empyreal lord. The effects of this aura are unique to each empyreal lord.
Seed of Life			KEY:Empyreal Lord ~ Seed of Life			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																					DESC:An empyreal lord can touch a willing creature and imbue it with magical healing power. The target radiates an aura of good as if it were an outsider and gains a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against negative energy and death effects. As a standard action, the target can release this energy, turning it inward as a heal spell upon itself or outward as a mass cure serious wounds spell on allies within 30 feet (caster level 15th). If not released, the energy dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. The empyreal lord can use this ability 5 times per day, but only on other creatures.
Hive Mind				KEY:Formian ~ Hive Mind					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:Formians share a telepathic bond with other members of their hive that enhances their hive mates' perception. As long as a formian is within telepathic range of at least one hive mate, it gains a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks and Perception checks. If at least one formian disbelieves an illusion, all formians within its telepathic range are also considered to disbelieve that illusion. If one formian is aware of combatants, all other hive mates within the range of its telepathy are also aware of those combatants.
Telepathic Caster			KEY:Formian ~ Telepathic Caster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:Due to a formian's telepathic nature, if it casts spells it does so as spell-like abilities.
Overcome Damage Reduction	KEY:Great Old One ~ Overcome Damage Reduction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack																						DESC:A Great Old One's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and mythic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Immortality				KEY:Great Old One ~ Immortality			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:A Great Old One does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, nor does it age. A Great Old One that is slain does not truly die-rather, it is forced into an extended period of dormancy that can last years, centuries, or longer. Exact details of this vary and are described in individual creature entries. Methods to permanently slay a Great Old One might exist, but such methods have yet to be learned by mortals.
Immunities				KEY:Great Old One ~ Immunities			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																						DESC:Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, aging, cold, death effects, disease, energy drain, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, and petrification.
Insanity				KEY:Great Old One ~ Insanity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																						DESC:Any creature that attempts to interact directly with a Great Old One's thoughts (such as via detect thoughts or telepathy) must succeed at a Will save or be driven permanently insane. The save DC is %1. This duplicates the effect of the insanity spell, or the insanity rules in the GameMastery Guide (in which case the save DC is also the ongoing insanity DC). A Great Old One using its telepathy to communicate doesn't activate this ability unless it spends a standard action to focus its mind on one opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect.|10+HD/2+CHA
Mythic				KEY:Great Old One ~ Mythic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				DESC:A Great Old One has mythic power (10/day, surge +1d12) and counts as a 10th-rank mythic creature. A Great Old One can use any of its spell-like abilities as the mythic versions of those spells (if a mythic version of that spell exists), expending mythic power as normal. It can also expend mythic power to use the augmented versions of these spell-like abilities.																																																																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|Mythic_Rank|10
Otherworldly Insight		KEY:Great Old One ~ Otherworldly Insight		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:All Great Old Ones gain a +10 insight bonus on Initiative checks and to AC.																																																																																																																																																																											BONUS:COMBAT|AC|10|TYPE=Insight	BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|10|TYPE=Insight
Unspeakable Presence		KEY:Great Old One ~ Unspeakable Presence		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																				DESC:A Great Old One's aura inflicts intense mental anguish and torment upon all creatures within 300 feet who can see and hear the Great Old One. The exact effects caused by a Great Old One's unspeakable presence vary by type. A successful Will save (DC %1) reduces or negates the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.|10+HD/2+CHA
Overcome Damage Reduction	KEY:Kaiju ~ Overcome Damage Reduction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack																						DESC:A kaiju's natural attacks count as epic and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Hurl Foe				KEY:Kaiju ~ Hurl Foe					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																				DESC:When a kaiju damages a Huge or smaller foe with one of its natural attacks, it can try to hurl the foe as part of that attack by attempting a combat maneuver check. On a successful check, the foe is knocked back 10 feet in a direction of the kaiju's choice and falls prone. The distance the foe is hurled increases by 10 feet for every 5 points by which the kaiju's check exceeds the foe's CMD. If an obstacle stops the hurled creature before it travels the whole distance, the hurled foe and the obstacle struck each take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of distance remaining and the foe is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.
Massive				KEY:Kaiju ~ Massive					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:Because kaiju are so massive, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to a kaiju's movement, though areas of forest or settlements are considered difficult terrain to a kaiju. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by a kaiju, or vice-versa. A kaiju can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. A kaiju gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb a kaiju-this generally requires a successful DC 30 check, and unlike the normal rules about kaiju and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on a kaiju's body provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.
Recovery				KEY:Kaiju ~ Recovery					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																				DESC:Whenever a kaiju fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, paralysis, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including binding and temporal stasis but not including imprisonment), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect. Doing so takes no action. A kaiju can attempt a new save to end the effect as often as it wishes, but can attempt to remove only one such effect per round. Once per year, if a kaiju takes an amount of damage that would normally kill it by reducing its hit points to a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, the damage instead heals the kaiju of twice the amount of damage-but this healing leaves the kaiju disoriented and demoralized. At this point, the creature becomes nauseated and seeks only to return to its lair. Any amount of damage dealt to it by an external source before it reaches its lair, though, immediately negates the nauseated effect and allows the kaiju to end its retreat and attack.
Spirit Touch			KEY:Psychopomp ~ Spirit Touch				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																				DESC:A psychopomp's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the ghost touch weapon special ability.
Spiritsense				KEY:Psychopomp ~ Spiritsense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Senses																			DESC:A psychopomp notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if it had the blindsight ability. This sense does not allow it to detect objects, but it does allow it to notice living things that are not creatures (such as normal trees).
