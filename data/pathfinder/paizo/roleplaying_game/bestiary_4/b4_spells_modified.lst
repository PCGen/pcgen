You can also use this spell to cause the weather in the area to become calm and normal for the season. &nl;Season &pipe; Possible Weather &nl;Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw &nl;Late winter &pipe; Hurricane-force winds &nl;You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather-where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather [which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later]. Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously. Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena [naturally occurring or otherwise] as well as create them.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Weather (rain only).MOD								OUTPUTNAME:Control Weather (cause or dispel rain only)																																																																																										DESC:You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can use this spell to cause rain in the area to become calm or increase in intensity. You cannot control specific applications of the weather-where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather [which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later]. Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dimension Door (within sacred site).MOD																																																																																																										DESC:You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within  the sacred site you're guarding. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired-whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature [carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load] or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dominate Monster (vermin only).MOD																																																																																																											DESC:This spell functions like dominate person, except that the spell is restricted to vermin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Empowered Cone of Cold.MOD																																																																																																												DESC:Cone of cold creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6x1.5 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 15d6x1.5].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Extended Animate Objects (Warsworn).MOD							OUTPUTNAME:Extended Animate Objects (7 Medium weapons only)																																																																																										DESC:You imbue up to 7 medium weapons with mobility and a semblance of life. Each such weapon then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. The weapon can be of any nonmagical material. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. This spell cannot affect weapons carried or worn by a creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fly (self only).MOD																																																																																																													DESC:You can fly at a speed of 60 feet [or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or if you carry a medium or heavy load]. You can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and your maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so you can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Haste (self only).MOD																																																																																																													DESC:You move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects. When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. [This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.] A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class [if any] also makes you lose dodge bonuses. All of the hasted creature's modes of movement [including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim] increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple haste effects don't stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hedge Stride.MOD																																																																																																														DESC:When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to step into an area of brush or hedges, magically infusing yourself with the plant. Once within a hedge, you can teleport from that particular hedge to another hedge. The hedges you enter must be of similar vegetation, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an area of brush or hedges, you instantly know the location of all other areas of brush or hedges of similar vegetation within 1,500 feet and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the hedge you moved into. You may choose to pass to any hedge of the appropriate kind within range. You may move into a hedge up to one time per caster level [passing from one hedge to another counts only as moving into one hedge]. The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a hedge. Each transport is a full-round action. You can, at your option, remain within a hedge without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the hedge in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hold Monster (vermin only).MOD																																																																																																											DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except that the spell is restricted to vermin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Jar (other formians only).MOD																																																																																																											DESC:By casting magic jar, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal [known as the magic jar], leaving your body lifeless. Then you can take control of a nearby formian's body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar [thereby returning the trapped soul to its body] and attempt to possess another formian's body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level [and on the same plane of existence]. You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. [Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.] You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks [or more advantageous two-weapon attacks] than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs [it is dead]. If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body [or die if your body is out of range or destroyed]. If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body [or die, if it is out of range of your current position], and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body [or dies if it is out of range]. Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host's location.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Miracle (Divine Realm).MOD																																																																																																												DESC:A miracle can produce physical effects that manipulate the caster's divine realm realm or produce effects that are relevant to their areas of concern.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plane Shift (Nightmare Lord).MOD								OUTPUTNAME:Plane Shift (Material Plane/Dimension of Dreams only)																																																																																									DESC:You move yourself or other creatures between the Dimension of Dreams and the Material Plane. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach the Dimension of Dreams, though you appear 5 to 500 miles [5d%%] from your intended destination. Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back [including casting plane shift again].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plane Shift (Ostiarius).MOD									OUTPUTNAME:Plane Shift (Material Plane/Plane of Shadow only, LE creatures only)																																																																																						DESC:You move yourself or other lawful evil creatures between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach the Plane of Shadow, though you appear 5 to 500 miles [5d%%] from your intended destination. Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back [including casting plane shift again].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plane Shift (Owb).MOD										OUTPUTNAME:Plane Shift (Material Plane/Plane of Shadow only, self only)																																																																																								DESC:You move yourself between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach the Plane of Shadow, though you appear 5 to 500 miles [5d%%] from your intended destination. Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back [including casting plane shift again].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Polymorph (self only/same size).MOD								OUTPUTNAME:Polymorph Self (same size)																																																																																													DESC:This spell transforms you into an animal, humanoid or elemental of your same size, but of your choosing. If you use this spell to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, the spell functions as beast shape II. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as elemental body I. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as alter self. You may choose to resume your normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Purify Food and Drink (water only).MOD																																																																																																										DESC:This spell makes diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated water pure and suitable for drinking. Unholy water and similar drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened Charm Person.MOD																																																																																																												DESC:This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally [treat the target's attitude as friendly]. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. [Retries are not allowed.] An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened Cure Serious Wounds.MOD																																																																																																											DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +15].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened Dispel Magic (Greater).MOD							OUTPUTNAME:Quickened Greater Dispel Magic																																																																																													DESC:This spell functions like dispel magic, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures. You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC. Area Dispel: When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell [such as a monster summoned by summon monster] is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature [returning it whence it came] in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object. You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. Counterspell: This functions as dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened Dominate Person.MOD																																																																																																												DESC:You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival [such as sleeping, eating, and so forth]. Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 [rather than DC 25] can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect [see the Sense Motive skill description]. Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell [a standard action], you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on. Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened Feeblemind.MOD																																																																																																												DESC:Target creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel the effect of the feeblemind. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened Lightning Bolt.MOD																																																																																																												DESC:You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level [maximum 10d6] to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips. The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened Mirror Image.MOD																																																																																																												DESC:This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you. When mirror image is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels [maximum eight images total] are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment. An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect [although the normal miss chances still apply].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quickened True Strike.MOD																																																																																																												DESC:You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during your next attack. Your next single attack roll [if it is made before the end of the next round] gains a +20 insight bonus. Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sending (dryads only).MOD																																																																																																												DESC:You contact nearby dryads and send a short message of 25 words or less to them. She recognizes you. They can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the sending is received, the dryad is not obligated to act upon it in any manner. If the dryads in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5%% chance that the sending does not arrive. [Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.]|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sending (to the hive queen only).MOD																																																																																																										DESC:You contact your hive queen and send a short message of 25 words or less to her. She recognizes you. She can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the sending is received, the queen is not obligated to act upon it in any manner. If the queen in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5%% chance that the sending does not arrive. [Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.]|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Share Memory (Jinmenju).MOD																																																																																																												DESC:You momentarily link your mind with the target and share a single memory of no longer than 1 minute. You can show the target one of your memories, show the target one of its own memories, or view one of the target's memories.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Silence (self only).MOD																																																																																																													DESC:Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell is centered on you, and the effect then radiates from you and moves as you moves. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a silence spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Speak with Animals (aquatic only).MOD																																																																																																										DESC:You can ask questions of and receive answers from aquatic animals, but the spell doesn't make them any more friendly than normal.

If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You gain a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, you need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface [even upside down]. A spider climbing creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class [if any] while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
