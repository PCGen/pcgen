If the creature is unwilling, she must succeed at a melee touch attack to steal the spell; the target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The arcanist can specify a spell affecting the target to steal, but if she's incorrect or doesn't know what spells are affecting the target, the spell stolen is determined randomly from all those affecting the target. If successful, the spell effect transfers to the arcanist, affecting her for the remaining duration. Unless the effect normally allows for a new saving throw during its duration (such as at the end of each round), this ability doesn't grant the arcanist a saving throw against it.

She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.

If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler's choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability.

Alchemy										KEY:Investigator ~ Alchemy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:InvestigatorAlchemyCreationBonus|0																						DESC:Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.  When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, you gain a competence bonus equal to %1 on the skill check. In addition, you can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. You must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.  Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator's level as the caster level.  An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.  When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping-an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.  Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant-comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.  An investigator uses the alchemist formula list (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 32) to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract's level. The saving throw DC for an investigator's extract is equal to 10 + the extract's level + the investigator's Intelligence modifier.  An investigator may know any number of formulae.  He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1st level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard's spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book.  An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator's or an alchemist's formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.|InvestigatorAlchemyCreationBonus																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|InvestigatorAlchemyCreationBonus|InvestigatorLVL																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.31

An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these of flashes of inspiration in other situations.  An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration.  The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to %1.  An investigator's inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night's sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add %2d%3 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll.  The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he's trained in the skill.  Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator's pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.|InvestigatorInspirationPoolBonus|InvestigatorInspirationDice|InvestigatorInspirationDieSize|InvestigatorInspirationBonus|0																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																BONUS:VAR|InvestigatorInspirationDice|1	BONUS:VAR|InvestigatorInspirationDieSize|6	BONUS:VAR|InvestigatorInspirationPoolBonus|max(1,InvestigatorLVL/2+INT)																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.31

Lastly, once a poison is identified, you can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison's saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison.

This effect lasts for %2 rounds or until you deal damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.  An Investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator's studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator's studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.|InvestigatorStudiedCombatBonus|InvestigatorStudiedCombatDuration																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:VAR|InvestigatorStudiedCombatDuration|max(1,INT)	BONUS:VAR|InvestigatorStudiedCombatBonus|InvestigatorLVL/2																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.34

If you used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), you may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If you chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual -4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.  You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.

Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.

Raging Song				KEY:Skald ~ Raging Song				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skald Class Feature.SkaldRagingSong.SpecialQuality							DEFINE:SkaldRagingSongRoundsPerDay|0	DEFINE:MasterpieceLVL|0		DESC:A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day. Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard's bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21). A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20%% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs. If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally's turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald's allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song's effects last for that ally's turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first. At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.

At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.

Rage Powers				KEY:Skald ~ Rage Powers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skald Class Feature.SkaldRagePowers.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DEFINE:RagePowersLVL|0	DEFINE:RagePowersPrereqLVL|0				DESC:At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32-34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack). Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once. When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald's level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power's effects depend on the skald's ability modifier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald's ability modifier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect. If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power's prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously). If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage). If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times. If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.

He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.

Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell. At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day.

Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian's rage powers and a bloodrager's blood casting and bloodline abilities.

(Unlike the barbarian's rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.) If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian's rage, bloodrager's bloodrage, or skald's inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.|SkaldInspiredRageStrConBonus|SkaldInspiredRageWillBonus	BONUS:VAR|SkaldInspiredRageStrConBonus|2+floor(SkaldLVL/8)*2	BONUS:VAR|SkaldInspiredRageWillBonus|1+(SkaldLVL/4)*1	SOURCEPAGE:p.50

By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue.

This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance.

Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted.

To attempt to assassinate a target, the slayer must first study his target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the slayer makes a sneak attack against the target and that target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the slayer as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful, the target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to %1. If the target fails this save, it dies; otherwise, the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal and is then immune to that slayer's assassinate ability for 24 hours.|SlayerAssassinateDC																				BONUS:VAR|SlayerAssassinateLVL|SlayerTalentLVL	BONUS:VAR|SlayerAssassinateDC|10+(SlayerAssassinateLVL/2)+INT	SOURCEPAGE:p.54

She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check.

This movement doesn't negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original square. This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.|DodgingPanacheBonus																																																																																														BONUS:VAR|DodgingPanacheBonus|CHA																		SOURCEPAGE:p.56	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds

The swashbuckler makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a -2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature's result, the creature's attack automatically misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature's attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.

To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit. As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to deal %2 additional damage instead. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of panache points a deed costs (such as the Signature Deed feat).|SwashbucklerPreciseStrikeBonus|SwashbucklerPreciseStrikeDoubleBonus													ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Swashbuckler Precise Strike ~ 1H|Swashbuckler Precise Strike ~ Light	BONUS:VAR|SwashbucklerPreciseStrikeBonus|SwashbucklerDeedsLVL	BONUS:VAR|SwashbucklerPreciseStrikeDoubleBonus|2*SwashbucklerDeedsLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds

The swashbuckler chooses a part of the body to target. If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted. If a creature doesn't have one of the listed body locations, that body part cannot be targeted. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to targeted strikes. Items or abilities that protect a creature from critical hits also protect a creature from targeted strikes. &nl;Arms - On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the swashbuckler's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands.

This energy can be used to deal or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted. Using this ability is a standard action that expends two uses of his fervor ability and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The warpriest must present a holy (or unholy) symbol to use this ability. A good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to heal living creatures or to deal damage to undead creatures. An evil cleric (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) channels positive energy if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or negative energy if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells. Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to the amount listed in the fervor ability. Creatures that take damage from channeled energy must succeed at a Will saving throw to halve the damage. The save DC is %1. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total-all excess healing is lost.

This power grants the armor a +%1 enhancement bonus. The warpriest can use this ability %2 of minutes per day equal to his warpriest level. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments, but they don't need to be consecutive. These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance armor any of the following armor special abilities: energy resistance (normal, improved, and greater), fortification (heavy, light, or moderate), glamered, and spell resistance (13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability's base cost (see Table 15-4 on page 463 of the Core Rulebook). For this purpose, glamered counts as a +1 bonus, energy resistance counts as +2, improved energy resistance counts as +4, and greater energy resistance counts as +5. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other special abilities can be added. The enhancement bonus and armor special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses apply only while the warpriest is wearing the armor, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield. When the warpriest uses this ability, he can also use his sacred weapon ability as a free action by expending one use of his fervor.|WarpriestSacredArmorEnhancement|WarpriestSacredArmorUses																																																																																																																																																																																						BONUS:VAR|WarpriestSacredArmorEnhancement|1+max(0,(min(20,WarpriestLVL)-7)/3)	BONUS:VAR|WarpriestSacredArmorUses|WarpriestLVL																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.63

This ability works exactly like the investigator's inspiration ability, except that you gain the pool of inspiration upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, and any unspent inspiration is lost at the end of the cognatogen's duration. If you already have access to inspiration, the inspiration added by the inspiring cognatogen is added to your inspiration pool, but each time you expend at least one use of inspiration while this ability is active, you must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become dazed for 1 round. You cannot use inspiration to augment this saving throw. &nl; All limitations of mutagens apply to an inspiring cognatogen as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen (either the standard cognatogen from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic or the inspired cognatogen) at a time, a cognatogen not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes non-alchemists sick, and so on.

Inspiring Cognatogen		KEY:Discovery ~ Inspiring Cognatogen												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.AlchemistDiscovery						VISIBLE:DISPLAY																																																																															DESC:An alchemist with this discovery leans how to make an inspiring cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that grants him inspiration (as the investigator's class feature) at the expense of Strength and Constitution.  Upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, the alchemist gains a pool of inspiration equal to 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC and takes a -2 penalty to both Strength and Constitution. &nl; As a free action, the alchemist can add 1d6 to the result of an ability or skill check (including any he takes 10 or 20 on) by expending one use of inspiration. This ability works exactly like the investigator's inspiration ability, except that the alchemist gains the pool of inspiration upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, and any unspent inspiration is lost at the end of the cognatogen's duration. If the alchemist already has access to inspiration, the inspiration added by the inspiring cognatogen is added to his inspiration pool, but each time he expends at least one use of inspiration while this ability is active, he must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become dazed for 1 round. He cannot use inspiration to augment this saving throw. &nl; All limitations of mutagens apply to an inspiring cognatogen as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen (either the standard cognatogen from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic or the inspired cognatogen) at a time, a cognatogen not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes non-alchemists sick, and so on. When the effect of an inspiring cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to Strength and Dexterity.  The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to an inspiring cognatogen.

It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack.

It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until it is picked up by either an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. If a non-mutagenic mauler or non-mutagenic mauler drinks a mutagen, they must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-mutagenic mauler or non-mutagenic mauler can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler can gain the effects of another mutagenic mauler or mutagenic mauler's mutagen if drunk. (Although if the other mutagenic mauler or mutagenic mauler creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an mutagenic mauler or a mutagenic mauler drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.

This ability functions whether or not the shield champion hits her opponent or moves on her turn. The shield deals no damage to targets it bounces off other than the original target of the shield champion's attack. Other circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion, such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield sticking to a mimic's adhesive. The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would. If the shield has the returning weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability. If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler's flurry.

He does not lose access to his actual secondary domain's granted powers or gain access to the other domain's granted powers. For example, an ecclesitheurge of Sarenrae with Glory and his primary domain and Good as his secondary domain can choose to gain access to the Healing domain; until the next time he prepares spells, he uses the Healing domain spell list as his secondary domain spell list instead of the Good domain spell list, but still keeps the granted powers of the Good domain and does not gain the granted powers of the Healing domain.

As with a wizard's bonded item, an ecclesitheurge can add additional magic abilities to his bonded holy symbol as if he had the required item creation feat (typically Craft Wondrous Item), provided he meets the feat's level prerequisites. For example, an ecclesitheurge with a bonded holy symbol who wants to add a wondrous amulet ability, like amulet of natural armor, to his bonded holy symbol must be at least 3rd level to do so. The magic properties of a bonded holy symbol, including any magic abilities the ecclesitheurge added to the object, function for only the ecclesitheurge. If a bonded holy symbol's owner dies or the item is replaced, the object loses all enhancements the ecclesitheurge added using this ability.

This ability functions as the alchemist's mutagen ability (APG p.28), using his fighter level as his alchemist level. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until it is picked up by either an Mutation Warrior or a Mutation Warrior. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. If a non-Mutation Warrior or non-Mutation Warrior drinks a mutagen, they must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-Mutation Warrior or non-Mutation Warrior can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an Mutation Warrior or a Mutation Warrior can gain the effects of another Mutation Warrior or Mutation Warrior's mutagen if drunk.

# 7th Level
Dead Shot								KEY:Bolt Ace ~ Dead Shot											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bolt Ace Class Feature.Gunslinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:As a full-round action, the bolt ace can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the crossbow at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the bolt ace's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the bolt ace increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the crossbow. For instance, if a 7th level bolt ace firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The bolt ace only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone.

Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects. &nl;Arms - On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the bolt ace's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit. &nl;Head - On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. &nl;Legs - On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect. &nl;Torso - Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20. &nl;Wings - On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.

The amount of bleed damage is equal to the bolt ace's Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the bolt ace can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (bolt ace's choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.

She can end this ability as a free action. When a feral hunter uses this ability, her body takes on cosmetic aspects of an animal, such as furry skin, longer nails, elongated teeth, and oddly colored eyes; these changes do not grant her any abilities other than what is stated in the animal focus, and end when she takes on a different aspect or ends the ability.

Primal Transformation		KEY:Primal Companion Hunter ~ Primal Transformation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterAnimalFocus																																				DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At first level, a primal companion hunter can awaken a primal creature from within his animal companion as a swift action. The animal companion gains a pool of 2 evolution points (Advanced Player's Guide 60) that can be used to temporarily give the companion evolutions as if it were an eidolon. A primal companion hunter uses her hunter level to determine her effective summoner level for the purpose of qualifying for evolutions and determining their effect. At 8th level, the number of evolution points in her pool increases to 4, and at 15th level, it increases to 6. Activating these evolutions on the animal companion is a swift action. A primal companion hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per hunter level. This duration need not to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. An animal companion transformed in this way cannot exceed the maximum number of attacks available to the eidolon of a summoner whose class level equals that of the hunter. While transformed in this way, the animal companion's type changes to magical beast, though the primal companion hunter still treats it as an animal for the purpose of the Handle Animal skill. If a primal companion hunter's animal companion is dead, she can apply these evolutions to herself instead of to her animal companion. Uses of this ability count toward the hunter's maximum daily duration of evolution use. This ability replaces animal focus.																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:P.97
Primal Surge			KEY:Primal Companion Hunter ~ Primal Surge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterSecondAnimalFocus																																			DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At 8th level, once per day as a swift action, a primal companion hunter can touch her animal companion and grant it one evolution that costs up to 4 evolution points. The companion must meet the prerequisites of the selected evolution. Unlike the evolutions from primal transformation, this evolution is not set; it can be changed each time the hunter uses this ability. Using primal surge activates the primal transformation ability on the companion if it isn't already active. This effect lasts until the hunter ends the primal transformation. This does not allow a companion to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks. This ability can grant only one evolution at a time, even if the chosen evolution could be selected multiple times. This ability can grant an evolution that allows additional evolution points to be spent to upgrade that evolution (such as damage reduction or flight), and any points left over can be spent on such upgrades. This ability cannot be used to grant an upgrade to an evolution that the companion already possesses. This ability replaces second animal focus.																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:P.97
Primal Master			KEY:Primal Companion Hunter ~ Primal Master				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.ArchetypeAbility.Supernatural.HunterMasterHunter																																				DESC:(NOT IMPLEMENTED) At 20th level, a primal companion hunter becomes in tune with his primal nature. He can activate his companion's primal aspect as a free action. When using primal surge, he can grant his companion two evolutions instead of one (each costing up to 4 evolution points). This ability replaces master hunter.

Also, the creature making the Perception check gains a bonus based on its familiarity with specific voices, just as if it were confronted with a normal disguise (Core Rulebook 95). This ability is a language-dependent effect, meaning that if a creature cannot hear or understand what the infiltrator is saying, the ruse fails. Magic items, feats, and traits that affect typical disguises do not affect this disguise check. At 8th level, the infiltrator gains the effects of its master of disguise class feature on this special use of the Disguise skill (no penalty for a voice of a different gender, race, or age category, and only a -3 penalty for a different size category). This ability replaces poison lore.

He can use these extracts to take the appearance of specific individuals of the type of form he chooses, gaining a +10 to Disguise checks even if that extract does not typically grant such a bonus. Furthermore, these extracts grant the infiltrator a +10 bonus to Disguise checks made as part of his voice mimicry ability. This ability replaces poison resistance.

# Mastermind
Mastermind's Inspiration	KEY:Mastermind ~ Mastermind's Inspiration		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mastermind Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				DESC:A mastermind can use inspiration on any Diplomacy and Intimidate checks without spending a use of inspiration, but can't do so for Linquistics or Spellcraft checks. This ability alters inspiration.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.101
A Quiet Word			KEY:Mastermind ~ A Quiet Word				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mastermind Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.InvestigatorTrapfinding.InvestigatorTrapSense																																																																																																																																																																																																																													DESC:A mastermind's reputation precedes him. At 1st level, once per day a mastermind can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check (mastermind's choice when preparing the ally) within the next 24-hour period at the mastermind's behest. This skill check uses the mastermind's skill ranks instead of the ally's. The mastermind's affected ally still uses its own ability bonus for the check. Furthermore, when a mastermind uses this ability, he can expend one use of inspiration to give the ally use of the inspiration die when making the check. At 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability per day increases by 1 for every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this ability on the same ally grant that ally the benefit on additional Diplomacy or Intimidate checks. At 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1stlevel effects of this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind can only bestow this for a skill check that he can use inspiration on without expending uses of inspiration. For instance, a mastermind with the underworld inspiration talent can bolster his ally's Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, or Sleight of Hand skill checks, selecting a single skill for each use of the ability. This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.

Mastermind Defense		KEY:Mastermind ~ Mastermind Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mastermind Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.InvestigatorySwiftAlchemy																																																																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:At 4th level, a mastermind can, as an immediate action, expend two uses of inspiration to make an inspired defense. He rolls his inspiration die and applies the result as a penalty on an attack roll made against him. If the mastermind has the combat inspiration talent, he can expend one use of inspiration instead of two. This ability replaces swift alchemy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.101
Impregnable Mind			KEY:Mastermind ~ Impregnable Mind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mastermind Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.InvestigatorTalent9																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:At 9th level, a mastermind's secrecy, obscurity, and mental conditioning reach superhuman levels. He becomes immune to any divination spell, spell-like ability, or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a divination effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow a saving throw have difficulty piercing a mastermind's barriers, as a mastermind can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading a mastermind's thoughts speaks all of the mastermind's languages, attempts at thought reading automatically fail. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 9th level.

# Sleuth
Sleuth's Luck			KEY:Sleuth ~ Sleuth's Luck				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sleuth Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.InvestigatorAlchemy																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:A sleuth gains a fluctuating pool of luck, measuring her ability to get out of scrapes. At the start of each day, a sleuth has a number of luck points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Her luck goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), though feats, magic items, and spells that grant either grit or panache points can also grant a sleuth luck points equal to the amount of grit or panache they grant. A sleuth spends luck to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains luck in the following ways. Rolling a Natural 20 on a Knowledge or Sense Motive Check: While on an investigation, a sleuth regains luck by uncovering secrets. Rolling a natural 20 on these skill checks while actively investigating causes the sleuth to regain 1 luck point. Such skill checks made for more mundane reasons (such as normal research or using Sense Motive to gain information during normal bargaining or while gambling) do not regain luck for the sleuth. Determining which skill checks qualify is up to the GM. Rolling a 6 or Higher on an Inspiration Roll: When a sleuth rolls an inspiration die while on an investigation and the die comes up a 6 or higher, she regains 1 luck point. (If she rolls multiple inspiration dice at a time, she regains 1 luck point if the total is 6 or higher.) Like regaining luck via a natural 20 on a qualifying skill check, inspiration checks made for more mundane reasons don't qualify for regaining luck. The GM is the final arbitrator for what rolls qualify. It's possible for a investigator to regain 2 luck points on the same Skill check, if both the qualifying skill check is a natural 20 and any inspiration roll made is a 6 or higher. This and the 1st-level deeds below replace alchemy. A sleuth cannot take the alchemist discovery talent or any investigator talent that affects alchemy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.101
Deeds					KEY:Sleuth ~ Deeds					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sleuth Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.InvestigatorSwiftAlchemy																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:Sleuths spend luck points to accomplish deeds.

At 1st level, a sleuth gains the following deeds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Second Chance			KEY:Sleuth ~ Second Chance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sleuth Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:At 4th level, when a sleuth rolls an inspiration die or uses daring deed, he can spend 1 luck point to reroll either the inspiration or the daring deed die. If he rolls a 6 or higher on this reroll, he does not regain a luck point, and no matter what he rolls on either roll, he must keep the reroll result, even if it is lower.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Daring				KEY:Deed ~ Daring						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sleuth Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:At 1st level, a sleuth can spend 1 luck point when he makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll d6 and add the result to the check. He can choose to add this die after he rolls. If the d6 roll is a natural 6, he rolls another d6 and adds it to the check. He can continue to do this as long as he rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

Opportunistic Evasion		KEY:Deed ~ Opportunistic Evasion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sleuth Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:At 1st level, when a sleuth succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an effect that still deals damage on a successful save, he can spend 1 luck point as an immediate action to instead take no damage for that effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Sleuth's Initiative		KEY:Deed ~ Sleuth's Initiative			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sleuth Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:At 1st level, as long as the sleuth has at least 1 luck point, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and the weapon is not hidden, he can draw a single light or one-handed melee weapon as part of the initiative check. (Unlike with swashbuckler deeds, this does not have to be a piercing weapon.)

Make It Count			KEY:Deed ~ Make It Count				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sleuth Class Feature.Investigator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:When a sleuth uses studied strike, he can spend 1 luck point to apply an investigator talent that he doesn't already know and which affects studied strike to his studied strike. He must be able to fulfill that talent's prerequisites.

Furthermore, while under the effect of this bonus, if he moves more than his normal speed in a round, he gains a +4 bonus to AC until the start of his next turn.

The animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing.  The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Each category of condition has an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured. Minor Conditions (DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened. Major Conditions (DC 20): Dazed and staggered. Severe Conditions (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated. Dire Conditions (DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned. The animist can use this ability %1 times per day. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.

If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours.

A good witch channels positive energy (like a good cleric), and an evil witch channels negative energy (like an evil cleric). A witch who is neither good nor evil must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy; once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the witch. The witch can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This otherwise functions as a cleric using channel energy, except the witch does not require a holy symbol to use this ability. The hex channeler uses her witch level as her cleric level for all other effects dependent upon channel energy (except increasing the amount of damage healed or dealt). The hex channeler can choose whether or not to include herself or her familiar in this effect. This burst heals or deals 1d6 points of damage. Every time the hex channeler is able to learn a new hex (including major or grand hexes, but not hexes gained through the Extra Hex feat), she can instead increase her channel energy amount by 1d6.

Once per day, a spell sage can spontaneously cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or druid spell list as if it were a wizard spell he knew and had prepared. Casting the spell requires the spell sage to spend 1 full round per spell level of the desired spell (if the spell is on multiple spell lists indicated above, using the lowest level from among those lists) and requires expending two prepared spells of that spell level or higher; if the spell's casting time is normally 1 full round or longer, this is added to the spell sage's casting time. For example, if a spell sage wants to use spell study to cast cure light wounds (cleric spell level 1st), he must spend 2 full rounds casting and expend two prepared wizard spells of 1st level or higher. At 6th level and every 5 levels thereafter, a spell sage can use this ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of four times per day at 16th level).

The spirit whisperer picks a spirit from the shaman's list of spirits (see page 37). At 1st level, he gains a spirit ability granted by that spirit. At 8th level, he gains the greater spirit ability granted by that spirit. At 20th level, the spirit whisperer gains the manifestation ability granted by the spirit. He uses his wizard level as his shaman level for determining the effects and DCs of abilities granted by the spirit. In addition, he uses his Intelligence modifier in place of his Wisdom modifier for these abilities. He does not gain hexes, spirit magic spells, or the true spirit ability typically granted to a shaman by these spirits. This ability replaces arcane school and the bonus feat gained at 20th level.
