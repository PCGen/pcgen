A Twilight Talon can pay any amount into her dead drop fund when she does so, but can never have more than a total of %1 in her dead drop fund. A dead drop functions as an emergency cache of gear that any Twilight Talon agent can access while in the field. Part of the process of paying into the fund includes arranging dead drop locations in areas that the Twilight Talon suspects she may visit in the future. At any point in a wilderness region, but no more often than once per day, the Twilight Talon can take 1d8 hours to seek out the closest dead drop, at which point she can purchase any item from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook from the dead drop, deducting the price from the amount of gold she has paid into the fund at that date. At the GM's discretion, gear from other sourcebooks may also be available in a dead drop. In particularly remote locations, a GM may rule that no dead drops can exist, but the GM should inform the Twilight Talon of this fact when expeditions to such areas are planned. Dead drops shift locations often, so each time a Twilight Talon seeks one out, she must spend the 1d8 hours to find it.|TwilightTalonLVL*100	DESC:At 8th level, it takes a Twilight Talon only 10 minutes to pay into her dead drop fund, it takes only 30 minutes to locate a dead drop in the wild, and her maximum dead drop fund increases to 2,500 gp.

Blossoming lights are primarily found among the Lantern Bearers, as their powers are a great boon against the organization's foes. Despite this, their ways did not originate with elvenkind. Legend tells that Sarenrae, horrified by the consequences of the destruction of Gormuz, reached out to one of that city's survivors. She granted the frightened woman divine powers to guide her fellow survivors, both to safety and to goodness, and humbly asked her to spread the message of redemption and forgiveness.

Though they revere the natural world, halcyon druids are less focused on emulating its inhabitants. Instead, like Old-Mage Jatembe, they treat with beings from the Outer Sphere. As a sign of their allegiance, these druids wear fantastical masks depicting celestials, fiends, and-most often-the bestial agathions. Halcyon druids are peacekeepers, mediating between people and nature, people and the spirit world, and different groups of people. Yet when necessary, they use their magic to fight enemies of peace, especially demons and demon cultists. Most halcyon druids serve Nantambu and the surrounding villages-making, memorizing, and arbitrating the unwritten pacts between them. Some halcyon druids, however, are drawn farther afield.

Her penalty on attack rolls when using spell combat is reduced by 1 (to -1) when she casts a spell from the same school as her inscribed rune, but is increased by 2 (to -4) when she uses spell combat with a spell not from her inscribed rune's school. As long as she has a rune inscribed on her weapon in this manner, she cannot use spells from that rune's opposition schools at all with spell combat. The sigilus can maintain only a single inscribed rune on a weapon at any time; if she inscribes a new rune on a weapon, the previously inscribed rune fades.
Inscribe Sihedron			NAMEISPI:YES	KEY:Sigilus ~ Inscribe Sihedron					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Magus Class Feature.SigilusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																	DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.59		DESC:A sigilus learns to inscribe the Sihedron rune (the seven-pointed star that symbolizes all seven schools of Thassilonian magic) on a suit of light armor she wears. When she does so, her armor becomes physically empowered with defensive magic, granting her energy resistance 5 to two energy types of her choice selected from acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic, and increasing the armor's armor bonus by 1. (Note that this increase is an armor bonus increase, and thus stacks with any enhancement bonus a suit of magic light armor may have.) Inscribing the Sihedron rune in this way becomes part of the sigilus's spell preparation ritual-she can inscribe a Sihedron rune in this way once per day as a result. Each day she inscribes the Sihedron rune, she can change the two types of energy resistance it grants as she wishes. At 13th level, an inscribed Sihedron rune grants energy resistance 10 to one energy type and energy resistance 5 to two other energy types, and its armor bonus increases to +2. A Sihedron rune can be inscribed only on light armor-it cannot be inscribed on medium or heavy armor, even if the magus later gains proficiency with medium or heavy armor.

Runesage							KEY:Wizard Archetype ~ Runesage					CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.WizardArchetype																								DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.58		DESC:Runesages draw upon the mystic energies of ancient Thassilon. While they sometimes experiment with the same heinous techniques exploited by the runelords, runesages temper their explorations into classic Thassilonian mysteries with moderation and empathy, maintaining balance by using small gemstones as the foci for their spellcasting. Runesages are experts at identifying spell effects associated with Thassilonian magic. As most of Thassilon's mysteries remain buried, runesages remain ever curious and continue to seek out new locations that hide secrets caches of Thassilonian magic.

Runic Focus							KEY:Runesage ~ Runic Focus						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.RunesageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																	DESCISPI:YES	SOURCEPAGE:p.58		DESC:A runesage can use her knowledge of runes to create a runic focus, a small, semiprecious stone engraved with Thassilonian runes that she manipulates to alter her spellcasting abilities. In function, a runic focus behaves like an ioun stone. To activate a runic focus, the runesage must meditate on it as she prepares her spells. Following spell preparation, she tosses the gemstone into the air, after which it orbits around her head. A runic focus remains in orbit until the next time the runesage prepares her spells. A runic focus automatically functions as a runesage's bonded object. A runesage does not have the option to specialize in an arcane school-all runesages must be universalists. However, when a runesage creates a runic focus, she must choose one Thassilonian school of magic (see page 63). When she prepares her spells, she is treated as a Thassilonian magic specialist of her runic focus's school for the purposes of determining what spells she can prepare (including gaining two additional spell slots per spell level of her school, and being unable to prepare spells from her runic focus's two opposition schools). She does not gain the corresponding powers of that school, however, and always functions as a universalist wizard in this regard. A runic focus allows the runesage to augment spells of a single arcane school to which the runic focus is aligned. As long as a runic focus remains activated, the runesage doesn't require material components for any spell she casts from the runic focus's aligned arcane school, provided the component's cost never exceeds %1 gp. If the spell requires a material component that surpasses the cost limit, the runesage must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal. A runic focus has an AC of 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5, as per an ioun stone. While the first runic focus a runesage creates is free, replacement runic foci can be created using the standard rules for replacing a bonded object for a wizard's arcane bond. When a runesage creates a new runic focus, she can focus it on a different school of Thassilonian magic than her previous focus as long as the new school is not one that was an oppositional school from her previous focus. For example, a runesage with a runic focus on necromancy could abandon that focus and replace it with a new focus on any school other than abjuration and enchantment (as these two schools are opposition schools to Thassilonian necromancy). A runic focus cannot be enchanted. It orbits the wearer's head like an ioun stone, but cannot be socketed in a wayfinder, implanted, or otherwise removed from orbit. This ability alters arcane bond and replaces arcane school.|WizardLVL*10		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Universal School	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Runic Focus School|1	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=1|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=2|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=3|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=4|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=5|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=6|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=7|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=8|2	BONUS:SPELLCAST|CLASS=Wizard;LEVEL=9|2
