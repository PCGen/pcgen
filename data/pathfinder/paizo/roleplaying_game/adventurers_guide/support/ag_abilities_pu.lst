In order to be admitted into the Monastery of Unblinking Flame and become one of these disciples, a supplicant must prove his worth by outwitting an efreeti. Those who succeed often become monks known as the brazen disciples. Brazen disciples believe that the best way to prepare for this test is to emulate the efreeti's own duplicitous ways. By studying genie contracts, brazen disciples learn how to take advantage of loopholes, and by pondering riddles, they learn how to obfuscate truth. They use deception in their fighting style, and many go a step further, incorporating fire and smoke both mundane and magical. Though most brazen disciples focus on joining the Houses of Perfection, some become enamored with the efreet and instead seek out genie masters.

If one can dominate these beings of pure (albeit cruel) law, then the power of that law is theirs by right. While the Test undertaken by those who seek to become full Hellknights is one method by which this power is earned, the devil binder takes this philosophy a step further, forcing a devil into service. Unlike those of most summoners, a devil binder's eidolon does not willingly serve its master due to a similar philosophical bent. While some devil binders (especially those who do serve Hell) seek more amicable relationships with these infernal servants, others treat their eidolons as mere tools, remorselessly ordering the devils into battle. The nature of the summoner's magical bond is irrevocably altered by their style of invocation. A devil binder borrows extraplanar quintessence from her eidolon, gaining strange abilities for herself and evolving her eidolon's magical powers.

Smite Chaos							KEY:Devil Binder Eidolon Smite Chaos				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:DBESmiteTimes|0											SOURCEPAGE:p.90		DESC:You can call out to the powers of law to aid you in your struggle against chaos %1/day. As a swift action, you choose one target within sight to smite. If this target is chaotic, you add +%2 to your attack rolls and +%3 to all damage rolls made against it, and automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. This ability is twice as effective against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey. In addition, you gain a +%4 deflection bonus to your AC against attacks made by the target. If you target a creature that is not chaotic, the smite is wasted with no effect. The smite effect remains until the target is dead or the next time you rest and regain your uses of this ability.|DBESmiteTimes|max(CHA,0)|TL|max(CHA,0)		BONUS:VAR|DBESmiteTimes|(TL-2)/4		ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|DBESmiteTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per day
