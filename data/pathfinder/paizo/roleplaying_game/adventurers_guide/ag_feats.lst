#Animal Companion Feat
Al-Zabriti-Trained Horse	NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Animal																																																				PRERACE:1,Companion (Horse)				DESCISPI:YES	DESC:This horse was trained by the Al-Zabriti tribespeople. It knows more tricks and is more loyal to its rider than most mounts.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:This horse automatically knows the tricks included in the combat riding trick (attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel), and these tricks do not count against the normal maximum number of tricks the horse can learn. The Handle Animal DC to get the horse to perform a trick is reduced by 5, and the DC to teach the horse new tricks is reduced by 5.

Forceful Charge						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Animal			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Bull Rush,Power Attack																																								PRERACE:1,TYPE=Companion							DESC:This animal's charges move its enemies.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:Once per round when this animal companion hits an opponent with a charge attack, it can initiate a bull rush against that target as a free action. If it moves its full speed as part of the charge, it gains a +4 bonus on its combat maneuver check to resolve this bull rush.
Improved Forceful Charge				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Animal			PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Forceful Charge,Improved Bull Rush,Power Attack																																					PRERACE:1,TYPE=Companion							DESC:Enemies fall before this animal's charge.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:This animal can bull rush a target that is up to two size categories larger than itself. If it pushes the target at least 10 feet as a result of this bull rush, it can attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target as a free action. This trip combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The force of the bull rush attempt itself is what allows for the trip maneuver; the target does not need to be within the animal companion's reach at the end of the bull rush. For resolving any secondary attacks of the trip such as greater trip, use the target's final position after the bull rush.

This does not affect the armor's statistics, and it is still considered heavy armor for all other purposes.

Adjusting to a reverse grip and keeping your blade in motion, you parry your rival's strikes with ease.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:While using Aldori Style, at the beginning of your turn, you can designate a focused target as a swift action. This designation lasts until the beginning of your next turn, and you take a -2 penalty to your AC against all other creatures' attacks for that duration. As an immediate action while using Combat Expertise or fighting defensively, you can attempt to parry the focused target's attack. This functions as the swashbuckler's opportune parry and riposte deed (Advanced Class Guide 57), except that it does not cost panache and you cannot riposte.

As with the Cypher Magic feat, Cypher Script was originally developed by the Cyphermages of Riddleport, but recently has been spreading through the Inner Sea region.	SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BENEFIT:Any spell you scribe in your spellbook costs half as much as normal and takes up only half the room it normally would (round all fractions up).

This sense does not alert you to the direction of the outsider. Anything that can thwart or mislead detect evil can likewise block this sense.

Mask Focus							CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extend Spell,Nameless One																																									PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=3								DESC:You can use your mask as an additional focus for your arcane spells, enhancing their power.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.124	BENEFIT:While you're benefiting from the Nameless One feat, the mask that you wear in order to gain the benefits of that feat satisfies the focus component of any spell you cast that requires a mask (such as mask from divination). In addition, once per day you can apply the Extend Spell metamagic feat to an arcane spell without increasing the spell's level by adding your mask as a focus component. When Extend Spell is applied in this manner, its increase to duration applies only to effects that target you; other creatures use the spell's normal duration. For example, if you use this ability with the haste spell, the spell's effects last twice as long for you, but not for any other creature that you target with the spell.
Masked by Fear						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nameless One																														PREMULT:1,[PRECHECKBASE:1,Will=6],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Fighter ~ Bravery]									DESC:You embody all that you fear while wearing your mask.																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.124	BENEFIT:By donning a mask etched with your greatest terrors, you are able to eschew fear completely. While benefiting from the Nameless One feat, when you suffer the cowering, frightened, or panicked condition, that condition causes you to act as if shaken instead of imposing its normal effects. In addition, whenever you attempt a skill check (normally Intimidate) to demoralize an opponent, you gain a +3 bonus on the check.
Masked Intent						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nameless One																																																						DESC:Your masked face makes your intentions nearly impossible to discern.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.124	BENEFIT:While benefiting from the Nameless One feat, your intentions become especially difficult to read. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on opposed Bluff checks, and increase the DC by 4 to gather information about you using Diplomacy, to answer questions about you or your weaknesses or abilities using the appropriate Knowledge skill, or to identify any spells or spell-like abilities that you cast using Spellcraft. If you have 10 or more ranks in any of these skills, the bonus for that skill increases to +8.
Mounted Blade						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mounted Combat,Ride-By Attack																	PRESKILL:1,Ride=3																																DESC:You can use the momentum of your mount to carry your weapon through one foe and into another.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you use the Ride-By Attack feat, if your attack hits, you can also make an attack against a target adjacent to your original target. You take a -5 penalty on this additional attack, which does not benefit from any effects of a charge.
Mounted Onslaught						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mounted Combat,Trample																		PRESKILL:1,Ride=5																																DESC:You and your mount can shatter an enemy's line with your unyielding assault.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:On your turn, you can overrun more than one creature. Each overrun combat maneuver check beyond the first takes a cumulative -5 penalty. If you fail to overrun a target, your movement ends. Your mount can make only a single hoof attack against one target that is knocked prone by your overrun (not one per prone opponent). [Normal] You can perform only one overrun combat maneuver per round.
Nameless One						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																														DESC:You completely eschew your former identity, making you impossible to locate or even name.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.124	BENEFIT:When you take this feat, you eschew all of your former identities, going as far as to render your former name completely inaccessible to discover by mortal means. You perform an 8-hour ritual that requires the expenditure of 200 gp for rare oils, incense, and creation of a special mask. After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places. (For example, you could adopt the title "Blue Fox" or "Night Stalker", but not the title "Chelish Avenger" or "Spirit of the Mwangi.")&nl; At the ritual's conclusion, you must don the mask created for the ritual, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you're wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally.&nl; As long as you wear the ritual mask and do not reveal your connection to any past identities, any attempt to scry on you independent of your eschewed identities requires a successful caster level check with a DC %1. In addition, you are immune to effects that require the use of your name, such as the named bullet spell. While benefiting from this feat, you cannot wear any magic items in the head slot, as the mask used by this effect effectively occupies this slot (though this benefit is not magical for the purpose of dispel magic and other effects). In addition, you cannot attempt to impersonate a specific individual by any means, magical or nonmagical. If you ever reveal or confirm your connection to your eschewed identities, you immediately lose the benefit of this feat and gain 1d4 permanent negative levels as your discarded identities return. You cannot regain the benefit of this feat or remove these negative levels until you atone (as per atonement, as if restoring a class feature).|10+TL

While using this style, you gain a type of energy resistance based on the House of Perfection you have chosen. Additionally, you gain a ki pool that you can use to activate abilities of your chosen House of Perfection style. Your pool contains %1 ki points. If you have a ki pool from another source, you do not gain additional ki points from this feat. [Special] You can select Perfect Style multiple times. Each time you do so, you must select a different House of Perfection to belong to.|PerfectStyleKiPool		DEFINE:PerfectStyleKiPool|0	BONUS:VAR|PerfectStyleKiPool|1+(TL-1)/4	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|House of Perfection|1		STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE	ASPECT:Ki points|%1|PerfectStyleKiPool|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=Ki Pool
