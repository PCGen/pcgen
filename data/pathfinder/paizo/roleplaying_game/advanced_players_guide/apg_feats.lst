Spells that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) may not be redirected in this manner.

SOURCEPAGE:p.156																																																															BENEFIT:You can take 10 on Bluff checks to convince others you are telling the truth, so long as your story makes you appear innocent.

If that attack is a critical hit, the target is petrified unless it succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier. This is a supernatural polymorph effect.
Combat Patrol											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes,Mobility																																																																																																PRETOTALAB:5																																																	DESC:You range across the battlefield, dealing with threats wherever they arise.

SOURCEPAGE:p.156																																																															BENEFIT:When you use the total defense action while using a light, heavy, or tower shield, you can provide a cover bonus to AC against all attacks to an adjacent ally your size or smaller.

Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack must make a DC 10 Fly check to remain airborne, and has its maneuverability reduced by one step.
Crossbow Mastery											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point-Blank Shot,Rapid Reload,Rapid Shot																																																																															PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,15],[PREVARGTEQ:FeatDexRequirement,15]																																																					DESC:You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in melee with little fear of reprisal.

You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.

Dastardly Finish											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																																																																																																	PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttackDice,5																																												DESC:You can take advantage of an enemy's debilitated state to attempt a coup de grace.																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																																															BENEFIT:You can deliver a coup de grace to cowering or stunned targets.

SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																																															BENEFIT:You can choose to take a -5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to daze opponents you hit with your melee attacks for 1 round, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + your base attack bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn.
Dazing Spell											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																DESC:You can daze creatures with the power of your spells.																																																																					ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																																															BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become dazed for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the daze effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Will save to negate the daze effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A dazing spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.																																																																																																																																																																																																												FACT:AppliedName|Dazing

BONUS:VISION|Darkvision|60																		SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																																															BENEFIT:Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet.
Disarming Strike											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise,Improved Disarm																		PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,INT=13],[PREVARGTEQ:CombatFeatIntRequirement,13]																																																																		PRETOTALAB:9																																																	DESC:Your critical hits can disarm your foes.																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can disarm your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may disarm your opponent as if from the disarm combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Disrupting Shot											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point-Blank Shot																PRECLASS:1,Fighter=6																																																																PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,13],[PREVARGTEQ:FeatDexRequirement,13]																																																					DESC:With a well-placed shot, you make it harder for a nearby opponent to cast spells.																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																																															BENEFIT:If you ready an action to shoot an opponent casting a spell within 30 feet and successfully hit that opponent with a ranged attack, the concentration DC to successfully cast the spell is increased by +4.
Disruptive Spell											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																DESC:Your magical energies cling to enemies, interfering with their spellcasting.																																																																	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.157																																																															BENEFIT:Targets affected by a disruptive spell must make concentration checks when using spells or spell-like abilities (DC equals the save DC of the disruptive spell plus the level of the spell being cast) for 1 round. Targets that avoid the spell's effects avoid this feat's effect as well. A disruptive spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											FACT:AppliedName|Disruptive
Diviner's Delving											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (Divination)																																																																																																																																																			DESC:Your keen magical intuition makes reading signs, portents, and mystical clues quick and easy.																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.158																																																															BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks with divinations to overcome spell resistance or effects that impede divination (for example, nondetection). When using a divination spell that requires concentration, you gain information from the spell 1 round sooner than normal (so you gain information from the first 2 rounds with 1 round of concentration, and information from the third round in the second round of concentration).
Dreadful Carnage											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack,Furious Focus																																																																																		PRESTAT:1,STR=15												PRETOTALAB:11																																																	DESC:Slaying an enemy demoralizes your other nearby foes.																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.158																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a free action.

SOURCEPAGE:p.158																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, and both of you are required to make a Reflex saving throw against a spell or effect, you may take the result of your die roll or that of your ally (your modifiers still apply to the roll, regardless of which result you take). If you take your ally's result, you are knocked prone (or staggered on your next turn, if you are already prone or cannot be knocked prone). In addition, you receive a +2 cover bonus to your AC against ranged attacks as long as your ally is wielding a shield.
Eagle Eyes												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.KeenSenses																																																																																		PRESTAT:1,WIS=13																																																															DESC:Your vision is especially keen.																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.158																																																															BENEFIT:You ignore up to -5 in penalties due to distance on visual Perception checks, allowing you to see accurately at much greater distances than most.
Eclectic												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																	PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Human																																																																																											DESC:You have a talent for picking up different vocations.																																																																								BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Favored Class|1																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.158																																																															BENEFIT:Choose an additional favored class and gain either +1 hit point or +1 skill point whenever you take a level in that class.

If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.

Whenever you cast that spell you may apply any one metamagic feat you have to that spell without affecting its level or casting time, as long as the total modified level of the spell does not use a spell slot above 9th level. In addition, if you have other feats which allow you to apply a set numerical bonus to any aspect of this spell (such as Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Weapon Focus [ray], and so on), double the bonus granted by that feat when applied to this spell.
Spider Step												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												PRECLASS:1,Monk=6																																																	PRESKILL:2,Acrobatics=6,Climb=6																																																																												DESC:Your physical mastery grants you an impossible stride.																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.170																																																															BENEFIT:As a move action, you can move up to half your "slow fall" distance (maximum 50 feet) across a wall or ceiling or across ropes, branches, or even water or other surfaces that cannot support your weight.

Stabbing Shot											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Rapid Shot																																																						PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Elf																																																																																											DESC:You can clear the way to continue using your bow.																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.170																																																															BENEFIT:When adjacent to an opponent and making a full-attack action with a longbow or shortbow (including composite bows), you may choose to make a melee attack against that opponent with a drawn arrow rather than firing it. If the attack hits-whether or not it does damage-your target is pushed back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow normally, at the original target, or at another target within range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from Rapid Shot, and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee attack and the ranged attacks) take a -2 penalty. If your initial attack leaves you with no enemies threatening you, you can make the subsequent ranged attack or attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.

ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Aspect ~ Steel Soul																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.170																																																															BENEFIT:You receive a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities.

SOURCEPAGE:p.170																																																															BENEFIT:When using the Step Up or Following Step feats to follow an adjacent foe, you may also make a single melee attack against that foe at your highest base attack bonus. This attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round. Using this feat does not count toward the number of actions you can usually take each round.
Stone-Faced												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																	PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Dwarf																																																																																											DESC:Rocks show more expression than you.																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.170																																																															BENEFIT:You receive a +4 bonus on Bluff checks to lie or conceal your feelings or true motives, but not to feint in combat or deliver secret messages.

SOURCEPAGE:p.171																																																															BENEFIT:When you use bardic performance with audible components underground, the range or area of your chosen performance is doubled, and you can affect deaf creatures if they possess tremorsense and are in your new range. In addition, the DC for saving throws against your bardic performance is increased by +2 for creatures of the earth subtype, regardless of where the performance occurs.
Stunning Assault											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																																																																																				PRESTAT:1,STR=13												PRETOTALAB:16																																																	DESC:You powerful but imprecise attacks can stun your enemies.																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.171																																																															BENEFIT:You can choose to take a -5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to stun targets you hit with your melee attacks for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + your base attack bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn.
Summoner's Call											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Eidolon																																																																																																																																																			DESC:Whenever you summon your eidolon, it is more powerful for a brief period of time.

SOURCEPAGE:p.171																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can sunder your opponent's weapon, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may deal damage to your opponent's weapon as if from the sunder combat maneuver (roll normal damage to the weapon separately). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Swap Places												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork																																																																																																																																																															DESC:You are skilled at changing places with your ally during a chaotic melee.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.172																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can move into your ally's square as part of a normal movement (including a 5-foot step). At the same time, your ally moves into your previous space. Both you and your ally must be willing and able to move to take advantage of this feat. Your ally must be the same size as you to utilize this feat. Your ally does not provoke an attack of opportunity from this movement, but you provoke as normal. This movement does not count against your ally's movement on his next turn.
Swift Aid												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise																				PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,INT=13],[PREVARGTEQ:CombatFeatIntRequirement,13]																																																																		PRETOTALAB:6																																																	DESC:With a quick but harmless swipe, you can aid an ally's assault.																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.172																																																															BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can attempt the aid another action, granting your ally either a +1 bonus on his next attack roll or a +1 bonus to his AC.
Taunt													CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																												PRESIZELTEQ:S																	PRESTAT:1,CHA=13																																																															DESC:You may be small, but your remarks cut others down to size.

Teleport Tactician										CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes,Disruptive,Spellbreaker																																																																																																																																																DESC:You are highly alert for enemies using teleportation to approach you or flee from you.																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.172																																																															BENEFIT:Any creature using a teleportation effect to enter or leave a square threatened by you provokes an attack of opportunity, even if casting defensively or using a supernatural ability.
Tenacious Transmutation										CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (Transmutation)																																																																																																																																																		DESC:Your mastery of the magic of changing makes your transmutations more durable.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.172																																																															BENEFIT:The DC of caster level checks to dispel or remove your transmutations increases by 2; even if the spell is negated, its effects persist for 1 additional round before dissipating.
Thundering Spell											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																DESC:You can conjure your spells into existence with blaring thunder or fearful shrieks, deafening creatures damaged by their effects.																																																								ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.172																																																															BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, it becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A thundering spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.																																																																																																																																																																																																								FACT:AppliedName|Thundering
Touch of Serenity											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike																																																																																		PRESTAT:1,WIS=18												PRETOTALAB:8																DEFINE:TouchOfSerenityDuration|0	DEFINE:TouchOfSerenityDC|0	DEFINE:TouchOfSerenityTimes|0																		DESC:With a single touch you can reduce the threat of even the most savage of foes.

On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage and bestows no other effect or condition, but the target cannot cast spells or attack (including attacks of opportunity and attacks as immediate actions) for %1 round unless it succeeds on a Will saving throw with a DC %2 [of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier]. You may attempt a touch of serenity %3/day [for every four levels you have attained (but see Special)], and no more than once per round.|TouchOfSerenityDuration|TouchOfSerenityDC|TouchOfSerenityTimes
Trick Riding											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mounted Combat																																																																				PRESKILL:1,Ride=9																																																																															DESC:You are not only skilled at controlling a horse in combat; you can make it look like art.

SOURCEPAGE:p.173																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can trip your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may knock your opponent prone as if from the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop your weapon to avoid being tripped.
Under and Over											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Agile Maneuvers																																																																PRESIZELTEQ:S																																																																																		DESC:You can slip under a foe trying to grab you, knocking him off balance.																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.173																																																															BENEFIT:If an opponent larger than you attempts to grapple you and fails, you may make a trip attack as an immediate action against that opponent with a +2 bonus. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Underfoot												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility																																																																	PRESIZELTEQ:S																																																																																		DESC:You slip under and around your larger foes.																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.173																																																															BENEFIT:You receive a +4 dodge bonus on Acrobatics checks to move past opponents without provoking attacks of opportunity, so long as they are larger than you. In addition, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a larger opponent's threatened area (this stacks with the +4 bonus provided by Mobility, for a total bonus of +6).
Verminheart												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Empathy,TYPE.WildEmpathy																																																																																																																																																DESC:You have a special bond with things that creep, crawl, skitter, and sting.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.173																																																															BENEFIT:You may target vermin with spells and special abilities that only affect animals (although they are still affected by spells targeting vermin as well).

SOURCEPAGE:p.173																																																															BENEFIT:Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in gold pieces to "happen" to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry-if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and "acquire" new items. You must pay of these items normally. Special - At the GM's option, a character can substitute the Survival skill for Sleight of Hand with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.
