Formulae					KEY:Alchemist ~ Formulae							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																																					DESC:An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. An alchemist can study a wizard's spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them.

Your bombs also inflict an additional %4d%2 points of fire damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike. Splash damage from an your bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (%5). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a DC %6 Reflex save for half damage.|AlchemistBombTimes|AlchemistBombDiceSize|AlchemistBombDamageBonus|AlchemistBombAdditionalDice|AlchemistBombSplashDamage|AlchemistBombDC|!PRERULE:1,FullAbilityDisplay	DESC:You are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that you can hurl at your enemies. You can use %1 bombs each day. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert - their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, you must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst - you can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day - once created, a catalyst vial remains usable for years. Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, your bomb inflicts 1d%2+%3 points of fire damage. Your bombs also inflict an additional %4d%2 points of fire damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike.

It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenDC																																																																																																																																											ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Mutagen ~ Stat Selection First|PREMULT:2,[PREVARGTEQ:MutagenTierLVL,1],[PREVARLTEQ:MutagenTierLVL,3]	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Mutagen ~ Stat Selection Second|PREMULT:2,[PREVARGTEQ:MutagenTierLVL,1],[PREVARLTEQ:MutagenTierLVL,3]	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Mutagen ~ Stat Selection Third|PREMULT:2,[PREVARGTEQ:MutagenTierLVL,1],[PREVARLTEQ:MutagenTierLVL,3]	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Mutagen ~ Stat Selection Final|PREVARGTEQ:MutagenTierLVL,4																																							BONUS:VAR|MutagenNormal|1|TYPE=Base	BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenLVL*10	BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDC|10+(AlchemistMutagenLVL/2)+INT	BONUS:VAR|MutagenStatPenalty|-2	BONUS:VAR|MutagenACBonus|2	BONUS:VAR|MutagenStatBonus|4	BONUS:VAR|MutagenTierLVL|1	BONUS:VAR|SecondMutagenStatBonus|MutagenStatBonus-2	BONUS:VAR|ThirdMutagenStatBonus|MutagenStatBonus-4	BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenLVL|AlchemistLVL																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.27

Delayed Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Delayed Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery															PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,8						DESC:The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel magic can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier).

This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
Elixir of Life		KEY:Discovery ~ Elixir of Life	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery															PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,16						DESC:Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell true resurrection. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a resurrection spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end.

Extend Potion		KEY:Discovery ~ Extend Potion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery																										DESC:A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration.

Infuse Mutagen		KEY:Discovery ~ Infuse Mutagen	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistMutagenMod																							DESC:When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens - only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.

A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d%1 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d%1+4 points of damage deals 4d%1+4 points of damage instead).

Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power you use to call your eidolon. As a result, you can only use this ability when your eidolon is not summoned.|SummonMonsterLVL|SummonMonsterTimes|SummonMonsterDuration																																																																																																																																																																											BONUS:VAR|SummonMonsterDuration|classlevel("Summoner")	BONUS:VAR|SummonMonsterLVL|min(9,(classlevel("Summoner")+1)/2)	BONUS:VAR|SummonMonsterTimes|CHA+3				ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|SummonMonsterTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per day
Eidolon				KEY:Summoner ~ Eidolon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Eidolon																																			DESC:You possess the ability to summon a powerful outsider called an eidolon. You always summon an aspect of the same creature. Your eidolon has your alignment and can speak all of your languages. Your eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except that it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to you, your eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. You can summon your eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, your eidolon's hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if your eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. Your eidolon remains until dismissed (a standard action). If your eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to damage, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. Your eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally.																																							BONUS:VAR|EidolonCompanionLVL|SummonerLVL
Life Link				KEY:Summoner ~ Life Link				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Life Link																																			DESC:A close bond is formed with your eidolon. Whenever your eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, you can, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to your eidolon. This can prevent your eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. In addition, you and your eidolon must remain within 100 feet of one another for your eidolon to remain at full strength. If your eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%%. If your eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%%. If your eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when your eidolon gets closer to you, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.
Bond Senses				KEY:Summoner ~ Bond Senses				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Bond Senses				DEFINE:BondSensesRounds|0																										DESC:As a standard action, share the senses of your eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything your eidolon does. You can use this ability %1 rounds per day. There is no range to this effect, but your eidolon and you must be on the same plane. You can end this effect as a free action.|BondSensesRounds																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:VAR|BondSensesRounds|classlevel("Summoner")
Shield Ally				KEY:Summoner ~ Shield Ally				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Shield Ally																																		DESC:Whenever you are within your eidolon's reach, you receive a +2 shield bonus to your Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on your saving throws. This bonus does not apply if your eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Maker's Call			KEY:Summoner ~ Maker's Call				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Makers Call				DEFINE:MakersCallTimes|0																										DESC:As a standard action, you can call your eidolon to your side. This functions as dimension door, using your caster level. When used, your eidolon appears adjacent to you (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If your eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted.

Transposition			KEY:Summoner ~ Transposition				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Transposition																																		DESC:You may use your maker's call ability to swap locations with eidolon. If it is larger than you, you can appear in any square occupied by your eidolon. Your eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by you if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.

You cannot select any evolution that your eidolon could not possess, and you must be able to meet the requirements as well. You cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from your eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total number available to your eidolon). You can change the evolutions you receives from these points any time you can change your eidolon's evolutions.

Greater Shield Ally		KEY:Summoner ~ Greater Shield Ally			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Greater Shield Ally																																	DESC:Whenever an ally is within your eidolon's reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. For you, the bonuses increase to +4. The bonuses do not apply if your eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Life Bond				KEY:Summoner ~ Life Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Life Bond																																			DESC:Your life becomes linked to your eidolon's. As long as your eidolon has 1 or more hit points, you are protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce you to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to your eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as your eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner.
Merge Forms				KEY:Summoner ~ Merge Forms				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SummonerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Merge Forms				DEFINE:MergeFormsRounds|0																										DESC:As a full-round action, you can touch your eidolon to merge forms. This transformation includes all of your gear. While merged in this way, you are protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting you are suspended until you emerge from your eidolon (although durations continue to expire).  You can cast spells while inside your eidolon by taking control of your eidolon for the duration of the casting.

Should your fiendish servant die or be banished, you may not summon another servant for 30 days or until you gain an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, you take a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.|FiendishServantSummonLevel|FiendishServantSpellLevel|FiendishBoonTimes|FiendishServantSpellResistance|PREVARGTEQ:FiendishBoonLVL,15

Inspiring Command					KEY:Battle Herald ~ Inspiring Command			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:A battle herald uses her keen tactical acumen and decisive judgment to lead others to victory, as well as her mastery of command to assist herself and her allies in battle. All battle heralds may use inspiring command to inspire courage (as the bardic performance ability); bard and battle herald levels stack to determine the bonuses provided by inspire courage. At 1st level, and every two levels thereafter, the battle herald chooses one command to learn. Unless otherwise noted, these abilities provide a competence bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to her and to all allies within 60 feet able to see or hear her. Commands marked with an asterisk have the same range as above but only affect a certain number of allies (which can include the battle herald). Issuing an inspiring command is a move action. At 5th level, this becomes a swift action, and at 10th level, it becomes an immediate action. Maintaining an inspiring command is a free action that cannot be disrupted, but its effects end immediately if the battle herald is killed or otherwise prevented from taking actions (such as being dazed, helpless, or stunned). The battle herald cannot have more than one command in effect at a time. She may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Charisma modifier, plus 2 additional rounds per level after 1st. She may use rounds of bardic performance to issue inspiring commands, but not vice versa. Inspiring commands are language-dependent, mind-affecting effects. The battle herald cannot maintain an inspiring command and a bardic performance at the same time (this does not preclude abilities such as persistent command or the Lingering Performance feat, which continue an inspiring command or bardic performance after the battle herald stops maintaining it).

This healing is not positive energy and can heal undead creatures.

Sound the Charge					KEY:Inspiring Command ~ Sound the Charge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.InspiringCommand																																																																																					DESC:Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Improved Leadership				KEY:Battle Herald ~ Improved Leadership			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:A battle herald with the Leadership feat adds her inspiring command bonus to her leadership score.
Voice of Authority				KEY:Battle Herald ~ Voice of Authority			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:A battle herald is skilled at shouting commands over the din of the battlefield and signaling allies when speech is impossible. She gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks with creatures with which she shares a language. In addition, her allies gain a bonus equal to the battle herald's class level on Perception or Sense Motive checks to hear her commands or interpret her secret messages conveyed with Bluff. The battle herald's levels stack with cavalier levels for the purpose of the cavalier's tactician ability.
Easy March						KEY:Battle Herald ~ Easy March				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:At 2nd level, allies within 60 feet of the battle herald can hustle or force march during overland travel without ill effects for a number of hours per day equal to 1 hour times her inspiring command bonus.
Inspire Greatness					KEY:Battle Herald ~ Inspire Greatness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:At 4th level, a battle herald may use her inspiring command ability to inspire greatness (as the 9th-level bardic performance ability). This ability affects one creature at 4th level, two at 7th, and three at 10th.
Banner						KEY:Battle Herald ~ Banner					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:At 5th level, a battle herald may fly a battle standard that inspires her allies. This ability is identical to the cavalier's banner ability, and cavalier levels stack with battle herald levels to determine the bonuses provided by the banner.
Teamwork Feat					KEY:Battle Herald ~ Teamwork Feat				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extra																																																																																							DESC:At 6th level, a battle herald receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat. She can use her cavalier tactician ability as a move action to grant this feat to allies (if she has the cavalier greater tactician ability, this is a swift action).	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Teamwork Feat|1
Demanding Challenge				KEY:Battle Herald ~ Demanding Challenge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:This ability is identical to the 12th-level cavalier demanding challenge ability.
Persistent Commands				KEY:Battle Herald ~ Persistent Commands			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:At 8th level, a battle herald may allow her inspiring commands to persist even if she is incapacitated and unable to maintain them. If the player chooses, the effects of the battle herald's inspiring commands persist for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (these count toward her number of rounds per day limit). This ability does not apply if the battle herald intentionally stops maintaining an inspiring command-only if she is dazed, held, stunned, killed, and so on, and is unable to maintain them. If the battle herald recovers from incapacity while an inspiring command is ongoing, she may resume maintaining it as a free action.
Inspire Last Stand				KEY:Battle Herald ~ Inspire Last Stand			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:At 9th level, a battle herald may use inspiring command to grant herself and all allies within 30 feet the benefits of the Diehard feat. Conscious affected creatures also gain the benefits of inspire courage while at negative hit points.
Complex Commands					KEY:Battle Herald ~ Complex Commands			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																						DESC:At 10th level, a battle herald can have more than one command ability in effect at one time. Each must be begun separately and requires a separate maintenance cost. This allows the battle herald to have more than one single-target command (such as battle magic) in effect at the same time. The effects of multiple instances of the same command ability do not stack, even if the bonuses provided by that ability would normally stack (for example, if the battle herald maintains two pincer maneuver commands, her allies do not get double the bonus, even though dodge bonuses normally stack). The battle herald can also maintain one bardic performance in addition to her inspiring commands, though each must be begun separately and each requires its own maintenance cost.

# Holy Vindicator Abilities
Vindicator's Shield				KEY:Holy Vindicator ~ Vindicator's Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																						DESC:A vindicator can channel energy into his shield as a standard action; when worn, the shield gives the vindicator a sacred bonus (if positive energy) or profane bonus (if negative energy) to his Armor Class equal to the number of dice of the vindicator's channel energy. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until the vindicator is struck in combat, whichever comes first. The shield does not provide this bonus to any other wielder, but the vindicator does not need to be holding the shield for it to retain this power.
Stigmata						KEY:Holy Vindicator ~ Stigmata				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																						DESC:A vindicator willingly gives his blood in service to his faith, and is marked by scarified wounds appropriate to his deity. He may stop or start the flow of blood by force of will as a standard action; at 6th level it becomes a move action, and at 10th level it becomes a swift action. Activating stigmata causes bleed damage equal to half the vindicator's class level, and this bleed damage is not halted by curative magic. While the stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator gains a sacred bonus (if he channels positive energy) or profane bonus (if he channels negative energy) equal to half his class level (%1). Each time he activates his stigmata, the vindicator decides if the bonus applies to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, Armor Class, caster level checks, or saving throws; to change what the bonus applies to, the vindicator must deactivate and reactivate his stigmata. While his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator ignores blood drain and bleed damage from any other source and can use bleed or stabilize at will as a standard action.|StigmataLVL	DEFINE:StigmataLVL|0	BONUS:VAR|StigmataLVL|floor(HolyVindicatorLVL/2)
Faith Healing					KEY:Holy Vindicator ~ Faith Healing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																						DESC:At 3rd level, any cure wounds spells a vindicator casts on himself are automatically empowered as if by the Empower Spell feat, except they do not use higher spell level slots or an increased casting time. If the vindicator targets himself with a cure spell that affects multiple creatures, this ability only applies to himself. At 8th level, these healing spells are maximized rather than empowered.
Divine Wrath					KEY:Holy Vindicator ~ Divine Wrath				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																							DESC:At 4th level, when a vindicator confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 1st-level spell or available 1st-level spell slot to invoke doom upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The save DC is increased by +2 if his weapon has a ?3 damage multiplier, or by +4 if it is ?4. The vindicator can also use this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator.
Bloodfire						KEY:Holy Vindicator ~ Bloodfire				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																						DESC:At 5th level, while a vindicator's stigmata are bleeding, his blood runs down his weapons like sacred or profane liquid energy; when he uses Channel Smite, the damage increases by 1d6, and if the target fails its save, it is sickened and takes 1d6 points of bleed damage each round on its turn. The target can attempt a new save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects.

# Horizon Walker Abilities

# NB: This took me a time to figure out, but we use the RangerFavoredTerrainLVL and HorizonWalkerFavoredTerrainLVL proxy
#     variable in case a new class would want to add levels to this class. Like where a Ranger used to behave as a
#     druid of four levels lower than a Druid for the Animal Companion class ability. There the Ranger would add
#     MAX(0,CL-4) to the Druid ability level.

Mutagenic Form			KEY:Master Chymist ~ Mutagenic Form				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master Chymist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Special Quality.Extraordinary																											DESC:A master chymist's mutagenic form is an alter ego that has a different personality than her normal form, an outgrowth of the mental changes caused by the mutagenic potions she has consumed over the course of her career. The mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner. The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her normal form; they may look as different as two unrelated people. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name, and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds (though the alter ego's limited time in existence often makes this difficult). The mutagenic form even has his or her own alignment (which is selected by the player, but must be different from the master chymist's normal alignment). The change in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her mutagenic form. Example: Darabont is a neutral good gnome alchemist 7/master chymist 4. Her mutagenic form is a deformed, twisted creature called Butcher. Butcher is neutral, and more interested in seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest good. Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by Darabont, but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded friends during the hours she exists. Butcher does not dislike Darabont, but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in. As Darabont, the character detects as good and is affected as a good character by spells with effects that vary by alignment; as Butcher, the same character is neutral, is not revealed by a detect good spell, and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects.

In this form, she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this form. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen's modifiers replacing the current modifiers, and the longer duration taking precedent). The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its duration expires, her magic is interrupted (as with an antimagic field), or she expends another use of her mutate ability.&nl;A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her will by stress or damage. Anytime the character is in her normal form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available, she may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save. In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25 Will save; if she fails, on her next turn she uses a standard action to change to her mutagenic form (which counts as a use of the mutate ability).|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times	DESC:[%1 minutes]|MasterChymist_Mutate_Duration|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Alchemist ~ Persistent Mutagen	DESC:[%1 hours]|MasterChymist_Mutate_PersistentMutagenDuration|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Alchemist ~ Persistent Mutagen																																																					BONUS:VAR|MasterChymist_Mutate_Duration|(MasterChymistLVL+AlchemistMutagenLVL)*10	BONUS:VAR|MasterChymist_Mutate_PersistentMutagenDuration|MasterChymistLVL+AlchemistPersistentMutagenLVL	BONUS:VAR|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times|2	BONUS:VAR|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times|1|PREVARGTEQ:MasterChymistLVL,5	BONUS:VAR|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times|1|PREVARGTEQ:MasterChymistLVL,8	BONUS:VAR|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times|1|PREVARGTEQ:MasterChymistLVL,10	SOURCEPAGE:p.268	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per day	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1 minutes, %2/day)|MasterChymist_Mutate_Duration|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Alchemist ~ Persistent Mutagen	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1 hours, %2/day)|MasterChymist_Mutate_PersistentMutagenDuration|MasterChymist_Mutate_Times|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Alchemist ~ Persistent Mutagen

Disguise		KEY:Advanced Mutagen ~ Disguise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MasterChymistAdvancedMutagen.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																														DESC:When in her mutagenic form, the chymist can temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form. As a standard action, she may make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to assume the appearance of her normal form for one minute. Each additional minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1 increase to the DC. Failure means the chymist assumes her normal form (as if ending the use of mutagenic form) or reverts fully to her mutagenic form. At any time while using this ability, the chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action. Once this ability ends, the chymist cannot use it again until 10 minutes have passed. Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form such as draconic mutagen, feral mutagen, and growth mutagen do not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form. Time spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic form.

Art of Deception					KEY:Master Spy ~ Art of Deception				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																											DEFINE:MasterSpyArtOfDeceptionBonus|0															DESC:A master spy adds her class level to all Bluff, Disguise, and Sense Motive checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																BONUS:SKILL|Bluff,Disguise,Sense Motive|MasterSpyArtOfDeceptionBonus	BONUS:VAR|MasterSpyArtOfDeceptionBonus|MasterSpyLVL
Master of Disguise				KEY:Master Spy ~ Master of Disguise				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																DESC:A master spy can create a disguise in half the time normally required. In addition, any penalties from assuming a disguise of a different gender, race, age, or size are reduced by 1.
Sneak Attack					KEY:Master Spy ~ Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																DESC:This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at every third level (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th). If a master spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Sneak Attack																																											BONUS:VAR|SneakAttackDice|((MasterSpyLVL-1)/3)+1
Glib Lie						KEY:Master Spy ~ Glib Lie					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																DESC:A master spy of 2nd level or higher can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the spy must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the master spy's class level to succeed (as if she were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the spy's lies or force her to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the master spy the glibness spell's bonus on Bluff checks.
Mask Alignment					KEY:Master Spy ~ Mask Alignment				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																DESC:A master spy of 2nd level or higher can alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as detect evil). She may choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.
Nonmagical Aura					KEY:Master Spy ~ Nonmagical Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																DESC:At 3rd level, a master spy can use magic aura twice per day, but only for the purpose of making an object appear nonmagical.
Superficial Knowledge				KEY:Master Spy ~ Superficial Knowledge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																DESC:A master spy gives the appearance of knowing more than she actually does. Starting at 3rd level, she can make untrained Knowledge and Profession checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity as if she were trained and gains a bonus equal to half her level on these checks. For example, a master spy masquerading as a noblewoman can make untrained Knowledge (history) checks about the kingdom and Knowledge (nobility) checks about its noble and royal families as if she were trained, but she cannot make untrained Knowledge (nature) skill checks to identify herbs.
Concealed Thoughts				KEY:Master Spy ~ Concealed Thoughts				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																DESC:A 4th-level master spy can conceal her schemes from mind-reading magic. When a creature is using detect thoughts or similar magic to read her mind, she decides what surface thoughts her opponent detects, and her true surface thoughts remain private. This ability does not protect against mental attacks or mind-reading that delves deeper than surface thoughts.
Quick Change					KEY:Master Spy ~ Quick Change					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																DESC:Starting at 4th level, a master spy can assume a disguise in only 2d4 rounds by taking a -10 penalty on her Disguise check. This penalty drops to -5 at 8th level.
Elude Detection					KEY:Master Spy ~ Elude Detection				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																DESC:At 5th level, a master spy can befuddle divinations used against her as if she were under the effect of a nondetection spell with a caster level equal to her character level. She can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the nondetection for 1d4 rounds.
Slippery Mind					KEY:Master Spy ~ Slippery Mind				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																DESC:At 5th level, a master spy can slip away from mental control. This functions as the rogue advanced talent of the same name. If the spy has the slippery mind ability from another class, these abilities stack, but she can still only use slippery mind once per round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Slippery Mind																																											BONUS:VAR|SlipperyMindTimes|1
Shift Alignment					KEY:Master Spy ~ Shift Alignment				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																DESC:Starting at 6th level, a master spy's control over her aura improves. When she assumes a false alignment, she can choose to have all spells and magic items affect her as though she were that alignment; this includes helpful and harmful effects. For example, a neutral good master spy can shift her aura to lawful evil so she can pass through a doorway that shocks creatures that aren't lawful evil; if hit by holy smite with this shifted aura, she takes damage as if she were evil. A master spy can change her alignment aura from a masked alignment (as per her 2nd-level class feature, where effects still function based on her actual alignment) to a shifted alignment (as per this ability, where effects function based on her assumed alignment) as a standard action. Shifting her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.
Death Attack					KEY:Master Spy ~ Death Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																DESC:At 8th level, a master spy learns the art of killing or paralyzing a foe with a careful strike. This ability functions as the assassin's death attack ability. If the master spy has levels in another class that grants the death attack ability, these levels stack with her master spy level to determine the DC of her death attack, even if she has not yet reached 8th level as a master spy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Death Attack
Fool Casting					KEY:Master Spy ~ Fool Casting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																DESC:A master spy of 8th level or higher can trick an opponent into believing that she has been charmed or dominated. When the master spy succeeds at a saving throw against a magical effect that provides ongoing control (such as charm person, dominate person, or a vampire's dominate ability), she can allow the spell to take partial effect. To the caster, it appears that the spy failed her saving throw, but the spy is not under the caster's control. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but the spy is under no obligation to follow the caster's commands. The master spy can dismiss a fooled spell as a standard action. Fooled casting can be used when the spy succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against an ongoing effect, such as that granted by slippery mind.
Hidden Mind						KEY:Master Spy ~ Hidden Mind					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																DESC:At 9th level, a master spy gains the benefit of a constant mind blank spell at a caster level equal to her character level. The spy can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the mind blank for 1d4 rounds.
Assumption						KEY:Master Spy ~ Assumption					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Master SpyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																DESC:The ultimate ability of the master spy is to take over another persona entirely, making it her own. As a full-round action, the spy can touch a helpless creature and shift her aura to that of her target. This confuses divination effects and spells, even ones as powerful as discern location, such that they register the spy as being the creature she has touched. This ability is not proof against the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings. The assumption of an identity lasts until the master spy ends it (a standard action) or she uses the ability on another creature.


# Nature Warden Abilities
Companion Bond					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Companion Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																										DEFINE:CompanionBondLVL|0																	DESC:At 1st level, a nature warden's class levels stack with levels in all classes that grant an animal companion for the purpose of determining her animal companion's abilities. The nature warden and her animal companion have an empathic link like that between a wizard and his familiar. At 5th level, the nature warden's animal companion gains the same benefits the warden does when in the warden's favored terrain.
# TODO: This is going to be interesting to implement, will likely need code work
Natural Empathy					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Natural Empathy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																															DESC:For the purpose of the wild empathy ability, a nature warden's class level stacks with levels in all classes with the wild empathy ability. When in her favored terrain, a nature warden adds her favored terrain bonus to wild empathy checks. She may also choose to use wild empathy to demoralize an animal or magical beast rather than improving its attitude, as if using Intimidate rather than Diplomacy. At 4th level, a nature warden no longer suffers a penalty when using wild empathy to influence or demoralize magical beasts. At 7th level, she may use wild empathy to affect vermin (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2). At 10th level, she may use it to affect plant creatures (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2).
Mystic Harmony					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Mystic Harmony				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																															DESC:At 2nd level, a nature warden in her favored terrain gains an insight bonus to AC equal to half her favored terrain bonus. She loses this bonus when she is immobilized or helpless.
Wild Stride						KEY:Nature Warden ~ Wild Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																															DESC:At 2nd level, a nature warden and her animal companion gain the ability to move through natural hazards of her favored terrain (such as bogs, loose sand, snow, ice, rockslides, and so on) at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment (in effect, this is the woodland stride ability applied to non-plant environmental hazards). Terrain hazards that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.
Animal Speech					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Animal Speech				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																DESC:At 3rd level, a nature warden can speak with animals at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use speak with animals once per day. Her caster level is equal to her class level.
Silverclaw						KEY:Nature Warden ~ Silverclaw				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																															DESC:At 4th level, a nature warden's animal companion and any creature she summons with summon nature's ally gain DR/silver equal to the warden's class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Favored Terrain					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Favored Terrain				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																															DESC:At 5th level and again at 10th level, a nature warden may choose a favored terrain. This ability is identical to and stacks with the ranger class ability.
Survivalist						KEY:Nature Warden ~ Survivalist				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																															DESC:At 5th level, a nature warden suffers no penalty for using an improvised weapon or improvised tool. At 10th level, a warden can spend 1 minute examining and adjusting an improvised weapon or tool; thereafter she treats it as a masterwork weapon or tool.	BONUS:VAR|SurvivalistLVL|NatureWardenLVL
Woodforging						KEY:Nature Warden ~ Woodforging				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																DESC:At 6th level, a nature warden can manufacture wooden items which she may use with surpassing skill. Once per day, she may use wood shape as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her nature warden level. In her hands, items created with this ability are treated as masterwork items under the effect of an ironwood spell; in the hands of others, they are merely ordinary wooden items of the appropriate type. If the warden uses this ability to create armor or weapons, she may craft them into magic items as if she had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat (though they are merely magical wood in the hands of others, and only ironwood when she uses them).
Companion Walk					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Companion Walk				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																															DESC:At 7th level, the nature warden's companion shares the benefits of travel spells (such as tree stride and transport via plants) and polymorph and similar spells (including tree shape) cast by the warden from the druid or ranger spell list. The companion counts either as part of the warden or as an object with no weight, whichever is more favorable for the warden.
Plant Speech					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Plant Speech				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																DESC:At 7th level, a nature warden can cast speak with plants at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use speak with plants once per day as a spell-like ability. Her caster level is equal to her class level.
Ironpaw						KEY:Nature Warden ~ Ironpaw					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																															DESC:At 8th level, a nature warden may grant her animal companion and any creature she summons with summon nature's ally DR/cold iron equal to her class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability does not stack with the silverclaw ability. The warden must decide at the time of summoning whether a summoned creature gains the benefits of silverclaw or ironpaw. She may change which ability applies to her animal companion by spending 1 hour in prayer and meditation with the companion within 100 feet.
Guarded Lands					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Guarded Lands				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																															DESC:At 9th level, a nature warden may designate an area as her guarded lands, allowing her to treat it as her favored terrain or to enhance her bonuses if it is already in her favored terrain. The area must be no larger than 1 square mile, and the warden must spend 24 hours carefully studying the entire area. This period of study gives her a +2 favored terrain bonus in that area, which stacks with any favored terrain bonus for that area (for example, she also gets her forest favored terrain bonus if her guarded lands are part of a forest). She may also designate one creature type as her favored enemy within those guarded lands, gaining a +2 favored enemy bonus against the creature type that stacks with any favored enemy bonus she has against that type of creature. Allies who can see and hear the warden gain an initiative bonus equal to half the warden's favored terrain bonus for that terrain. A nature warden may have a number of guarded lands equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). When she reaches her maximum number of guarded lands, she can select a new guarded land by abandoning an existing one and performing the ritual for a new area.
Companion Soul					KEY:Nature Warden ~ Companion Soul				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Nature WardenClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																															DESC:At 10th level, a nature warden's bond with her animal companion is so strong that it transcends distance and even death. The companion's devotion ability increases to a +8 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. The warden may scry on her animal companion once per day as if using the scrying spell, except she needs no focus or divine focus. She may view the area around her companion or see through its eyes. If her companion dies, she can revive it with an 8-hour ritual; this has the same effect as raise dead, except it doesn't require a material component and the companion does not gain any negative levels from the ordeal.

The spirit guide also allows the rage prophet to use dancing lights, ghost sound, and mage hand as spell-like abilities once per day each (caster level equal to the rage prophet's class level). The DCs are Charisma-based.
Rage Prophet Mystery				KEY:Rage Prophet ~ Rage Prophet Mystery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Rage ProphetClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extra																																																												DEFINE:RageProphetMysteryLVL|0																DESC:[Not Implemented]	DESC:At 2nd level and every even level thereafter, a rage prophet learns an additional spell from his spirit guide.

A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The increase to Constitution grants the stalwart defender 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a result of an enemy's successful use of the Bluff skill or an enchantment spell, his stance ends.

A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death. A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the rage spell).

Roused Defense					KEY:Stalwart Defender ~ Roused Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Stalwart DefenderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DefensiveStancePower																																																																											DESC:The stalwart defender may enter a defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent in a defensive stance.
Smash							KEY:Stalwart Defender ~ Smash					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Stalwart DefenderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DefensiveStancePower																																																																											DESC:While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a shield bash or a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus -5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the character's Strength modifier. The character can make this attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple; this attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the attack hits, any grapple checks made by the stalwart defender against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.
Unexpected Strike					KEY:Stalwart Defender ~ Unexpected Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Stalwart DefenderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DefensiveStancePower																							PRECLASS:1,Stalwart Defender=4																																															DESC:The stalwart defender can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the stalwart defender, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. This power can only be used once per stance.

Uncanny Dodge					KEY:Stalwart Defender ~ Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Stalwart DefenderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																														DESC:At 3rd level, a stalwart defender gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A stalwart defender with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).
Damage Reduction					KEY:Stalwart Defender ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Stalwart DefenderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																									DEFINE:DamageReductionLVL|0																	DESC:The stalwart defender gains DR %1/-.

Improved Uncanny Dodge				KEY:Stalwart Defender ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Stalwart DefenderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																														DESC:At 7th level, a stalwart defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the stalwart defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the stalwart defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (see above), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Mobile Defense					KEY:Stalwart Defender ~ Mobile Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Stalwart DefenderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																														DESC:At 9th level, a stalwart defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance.

For example, a stalwart defender has 1 hit point left when a red dragon bites him; the defender may use this ability even if the dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally). Once the defender's attack is resolved, he suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this ability.

Steal Ki								KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~ Steal Ki					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MonkClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MonkPurityOfBody																																																											DESC:At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki from other creatures, though this ability is controversial in some circles of monks, who see it as nothing less than a form of vampirism. If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of that creature's ki. This ability replenishes 1 spent ki point to the monk's ki pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool. He cannot exceed his ki pool's maximum. At 11th level, each time the monk successfully steals ki, he can make an immediate saving throw against one disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for failing this saving throw.

If the monk has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool and scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he heals a number of hit points equal to his monk level. As with steal ki, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory act, no better than what the undead do to the living. A monk with this ability cannot steal both ki and hit points at the same time. This ability replaces wholeness of body.																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.110
Life from a Stone							KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~ Life from a Stone				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MonkClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkDiamondBody																																																											DESC:At 11th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki or life force from any creature, not just living creatures.

Sipping Demon							KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~ Sipping Demon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MonkClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkDiamondSoul																																																											DESC:A 13th level, a hungry ghost monk gains 1 temporary hit point each time he hits an enemy with a melee attack. The monk gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his Wisdom modifier when he scores a critical hit. The maximum number of temporary hit points the monk can have is equal to his monk level. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. The monk can only use this ability when he has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool. This ability is a proscribed manipulation of ki considered by many good monks to be a corruption. The ability replaces diamond soul.																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.111

#Monk ki mystic archetype: The ki mystic ability seems like it alters the monk�s ki pool ability, but it doesn�t say �This ability alters ki pool.� Is this because the ki mystic�s ki pool is a separate second pool that can only be used for the powers described in the ki mystic archetype, and the monk then also receives the regular ki pool that works as normal?
#No. When Advanced Player�s Guide was written, archetypes were new and the �this alters� language didn�t exist yet, meaning archetypes in this book, including ki mystic, never include it, even when they should by current standards. The ki mystic ability alters ki pool. At 3rd level, a ki mystic gets a ki pool of Wisdom modifier points that can be used for the abilities listed in the archetype. At level 4, this upgrades to a ki pool of 1/2 monk level + Wisdom modifier + 2 points, which is a single ki pool (the ki mystic does not gain two) that can be used in all the usual ways a monk can use ki, plus those mentioned in the archetype.
# Ki Mystic
Ki Mystic								KEY:Ki Mystic ~ Ki Mystic						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MonkClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkStillMind																																																											DESC:At 3rd level, a ki mystic gains a pool of ki points equal to his Wisdom modifier.

As an immediate action, the monk can spend 2 ki points to grant an ally within 30 feet the ability to reroll a single attack roll or saving throw. The ally must be able to hear the monk to gain the reroll benefit. This ability replaces purity of body.																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.111
Mystic Visions							KEY:Ki Mystic ~ Mystic Visions					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MonkClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MonkDiamondBody																																																											DESC:At 11th level, a ki mystic may receive mystic visions when he rests. These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany, or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in the monk's mind. The effect is similar to a divination spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The divination has no casting time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night. Using this ability costs 2 ki points that are removed from the next day's total.

The aura emanates out to a 20-foot radius. The monk and all allies within the aura can roll two dice when making an attack roll or a saving throw and take the better result. The aura lasts for 1 round, plus an additional round for every 2 ki points spent when the monk created the aura. The monk can dismiss the aura at any time as a free action, but the ki points for the full duration of the aura are lost. This ability replaces empty body.

Shared Defense		KEY:Divine Defender ~ Shared Defense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinMercy																																																	DESC:At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including paladins) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and CMD and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the divine defender's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25%% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium, or heavy fortification armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.116
Divine Bond			KEY:Divine Defender ~ Divine Bond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinDivineBond																																																DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter 7): champion*, ghost touch, heavy fortification, invulnerability, light fortification, moderate fortification, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 of the Core Rulebook). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties: energy resistance for +3 bonus, improved energy resistance for +5 bonus, or righteous* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine defender takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.116

In addition, allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any afflictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the affliction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save.

Divine Bond			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Divine Bond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																			DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the sacred servant's holy symbol to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/ day of lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first.

As a swift action, you choose one target within sight to smite. If this target is an evil undead, you add +%2 to your attack rolls and +%3 to all damage rolls made against the target of your smite. If the target of Smite Evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to +%4. Regardless of the target, Smite Evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite evil is in effect, you gain a +%5 deflection bonus to your AC against attacks made by the target of the smite.

# Warrior of the Holy Light
Power of Faith		KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.PaladinSpells																																																	DESC:At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items. At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can spend a use of her lay on hands ability to call upon. This causes a nimbus of light to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute. At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell lesser restoration. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day. At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as daylight for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated. At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25%% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as light fortification). At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4. The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally, protection against critical hits increases to 50%%.																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.118

Evil creatures within this burst take %1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A Reflex save DC %2 halves this damage and negates the blindness. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level + the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. Good creatures within this burst are healed %1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can use this ability %3/day [once per day at 14th level plus one additional time per day at 17th and 20th levels.

Animal Companion			KEY:Beast Master ~ Animal Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.RangerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RangerHuntersBond.AnimalCompanion.Animal Companion																																						DEFINE:BeastmasterCompanionChoice|0	DESC:A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level - 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possible animal companion choices-he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can. The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter's bond.

Improved Empathic Link		KEY:Beast Master ~ Improved Empathic Link	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.RangerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.RangerCombatStyleFeat_Six																																																DESC:The beast master gains an empathic link with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion's eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces the 6th-level combat style feat.

Strong Bond				KEY:Beast Master ~ Strong Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.RangerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RangerCamouflage																																																	DESC:At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The ranger's effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he may immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees fit. This ability replaces camouflage.

If the adaptation requires the ranger to make a more specific choice (such as what skill to use with Skill Focus), this choice is permanent and cannot be changed. At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type's list, as well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type he's selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired). The infiltrator can only use one adaptation at a time.

ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Sickening Spell		SOURCEPAGE:p.169	BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell.

A sickening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.
