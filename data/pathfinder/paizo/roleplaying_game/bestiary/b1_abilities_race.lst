Engulf		KEY:Giant Flytrap ~ Engulf	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:If a giant flytrap begins its turn with an opponent at least two size categories smaller than itself grappled in one of its mouths, it can close its jaws completely around the foe by making a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes. The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect.

An attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A stirge has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself.

Swallow Whole			KEY:Tarrasque ~ Swallow Whole		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption	DESC:If you begin your turn with an opponent grappled in your mouth, you can attempt a new combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than you. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while you do not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 of your total hit points), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of your interior is normally 10 + 1/2 of your natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in your mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

Vampire Weaknesses							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Weakness									DESC:Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire--they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points--a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.270

During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours thereafter, when the victim's head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation's progress is paused by sunlight or any light spell of 3rd level or higher, but stopping the transformation requires remove disease or a similar effect.
