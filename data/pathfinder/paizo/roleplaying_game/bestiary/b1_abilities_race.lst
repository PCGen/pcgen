Most dryad trees are oak trees, but other trees function as well (often having subtle influences on a specific dryad's personality and appearance). A dryad who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. A dryad that is out of range of her bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows-- eventually, this separation kills the dryad. A dryad can forge a new bond with a new tree by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save.	SOURCEPAGE:p.116

This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see page Bestiary Appendix 3: Universal Monster Rules), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water.&nl;Some creatures can transform themselves into vortexes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD they have. If the creature has a swim speed, it can continue to swim at that same speed while in vortex form, otherwise it gains a swim speed equal to its base land speed while in vortex form.&nl;The vortex is always 5 feet wide at its base, but its height and width at the top vary from creature to creature (minimum 10 feet high). A vortex's width at its peak is always equal to half of its height. The creature controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet high.&nl;The vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the creature enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the vortex moves into or through a creature's space. A creature in vortex form cannot make its normal attacks and does not threaten the area around it.&nl;Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the vortex might take damage when caught in the vortex (generally damage equal to the monster's slam attack for a creature of its size) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + half monster's HD + the monster's Strength modifier) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take damage as if it were hit by the vortex creature's slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can swim is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful.&nl;Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the vortex carries them or to escape the vortex. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the vortex take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The vortex can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume. The vortex can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes as a free action, depositing them in its space.&nl;If the vortex's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

# Ability Name	Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																																																					Source Page
Engulf		KEY:Giant Flytrap ~ Engulf	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:If a giant flytrap begins its turn with an opponent at least two size categories smaller than itself grappled in one of its mouths, it can close its jaws completely around the foe by making a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes. The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.	SOURCEPAGE:p.134

Body Thief					KEY:Intellect Devourer ~ Body Thief		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DESC:As a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, an intellect devourer can reduce its size, crawl into the mouth of a helpless or dead creature, and burrow into the victim's skull to devour its brain. This is a coup de grace attempt that inflicts 8d4+3d6+8 points of damage. If the victim is slain (or already dead), the intellect devourer usurps control of the body and may use it as its own, as if it controlled the target via a dominate monster spell. The intellect devourer has full access to all of the host's defensive and offensive abilities save for spellcasting and spell-like abilities (although the intellect devourer can still use its own spell-like abilities). A host body may not have been dead for longer than 1 day for this ability to function, and even successfully inhabited bodies decay to uselessness in 7 days (unless this time is extended via gentle repose). As long as the intellect devourer occupies the body, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the victim and basic information about the victim's identity and personality, yet has none of the victim's specific memories or knowledge. Damage done to a host body does not harm the intellect devourer, and if the host body is slain, the intellect devourer emerges and is dazed for 1 round.

A heartstone's magic is fueled by the hag's spirit and proximity; once separated from its owner (or upon the hag's death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.	SOURCEPAGE:p.215

Vampire Weaknesses							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Weakness									DESC:Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire--they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points--a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.270

During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours thereafter, when the victim's head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation's progress is paused by sunlight or any light spell of 3rd level or higher, but stopping the transformation requires remove disease or a similar effect.

This process takes 1d10 days--if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew.
