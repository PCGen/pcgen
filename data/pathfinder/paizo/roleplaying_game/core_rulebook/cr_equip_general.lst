One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.&nl;Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop.

Acid					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Splash Weapon	TYPE:Alchemical.Flask.Consumable.Weapon.Ranged.Thrown.Acid.Splash	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	RANGE:10	SIZE:M	COST:10		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		SPROP:splash weapon	DESC:You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.
Alchemist's Fire			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Splash Weapon	TYPE:Alchemical.Flask.Consumable.Weapon.Ranged.Thrown.Fire.Splash	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	RANGE:10	SIZE:M	COST:20		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		SPROP:splash weapon	DESC:You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.&nl;A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.
Antitoxin										TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Vial.Consumable														COST:50			SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		DESC:If you drink a vial of antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.
Everburning Torch									TYPE:Goods.Magic.Light Source															COST:110	WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.160	QUALITY:Bright Illumination|20 ft.	QUALITY:Shadowy Illumination|40 ft.	QUALITY:Duration|Permanent	DESC:This otherwise normal torch has a continual flame spell cast on it. This causes it to shed light like an ordinary torch, but it does not emit heat or deal fire damage if used as a weapon.
Holy Water				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Splash Weapon	TYPE:Alchemical.Flask.Consumable.Weapon.Ranged.Thrown.Splash	CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	RANGE:10	SIZE:M	COST:25		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		SPROP:splash weapon	DESC:Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.&nl;Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.&nl;A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.&nl;Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit). Holy water is made using the bless water spell.
Smokestick										TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable														COST:20		WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		DESC:This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a fog cloud spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.
Sunrod										TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable.Light Source													COST:2		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.160	QUALITY:Bright Illumination|30 ft.	QUALITY:Shadowy Illumination|60 ft.	QUALITY:Duration|6 hr.	DESC:This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck as a standard action. It sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A sunrod does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.
Tanglefoot Bag			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Splash Weapon	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable.Weapon.Ranged.Thrown.Splash								RANGE:10	SIZE:M	COST:50		WT:4	SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		DESC:A tanglefoot bag is a small sack filled with tar, resin, and other sticky substances. When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.&nl;A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.
Thunderstone			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Splash Weapon	TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable.Weapon.Ranged.Thrown.Sonic.Splash							RANGE:20	SIZE:M	COST:30		WT:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		DESC:You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -4 penalty on initiative and has a 20%% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast. Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5.
Tindertwig										TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable														COST:1			SOURCEPAGE:p.160																		DESC:The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.
Spellcasting				KEY:Spellcasting				OUTPUTNAME:Spellcasting				TYPE:Service			COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.163	DESC:The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him, and the default answer is no.&nl;The cost given is for any spell that does not require a costly material component. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell. If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell.&nl;Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren't returning with the caster.&nl;In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.	MODS:REQUIRED
