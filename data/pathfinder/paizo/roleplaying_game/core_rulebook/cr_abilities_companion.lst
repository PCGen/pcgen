# NOTE: Animal companion class abilities are not implemented by the Companion class.
# Instead, the master grants the abilities to the companion using the FOLLOWER tags through the "Mod *" and "KEY:Companion ~ *" abilities.
# Companion archetypes are implemented in the companion using "CF_*" flags following the same general mechanism as regular class archetypes.
# Each of the abilities granted by the master's FOLLOWER tags conditionally grant the appropriate companion abilities if the archetype CF_* flag doesn't exist.
# This indirection is required because the various "CF_*" flags are unavailable to the master and are not seen on the FOLLOWER tags.
