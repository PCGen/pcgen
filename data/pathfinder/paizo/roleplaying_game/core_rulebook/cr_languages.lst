# COMMENT: Support for Deaf Oracles - http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/faq#v5748eaic9os8
## [Character Questions] What does a deaf oracle (or other deaf PC) need to do in order to read lips?
## In the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild, any PC who spends a rank in Linguistics may learn to read lips in all languages she knows instead of learning a new language. She cannot use lip reading to decipher words in languages she does not know. When reading the lips of a speaking creature within 10 feet in normal lightning conditions, the reader does not need to make any skill checks. In more difficult situations, the lip reader must make Perception checks, with a DC determined by the GM.
