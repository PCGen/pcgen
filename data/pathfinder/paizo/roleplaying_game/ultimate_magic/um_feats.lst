SOURCEPAGE:p.142	BENEFIT:When you confirm a critical hit with a spell or spell-like ability, you may cast bestow curse or major curse on that target as an immediate action. This works even with ranged spells. You must have bestow curse or major curse prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.

SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:When you target a creature with a hex that cannot target the same creature more than once per day, and that creature succeeds at its saving throw against the hex's effect, you can target the creature with the same hex a second time before the end of your next turn. If the second attempt fails, you can make no further attempts to target that creature with the same hex for 1 day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:You can make Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to make creatures respond to you with hostility. No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier. The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Blighted Critical					CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:Critical																																					PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5],[PREVARGTEQ:CasterLevel_Highest,5]																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:With a critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability, you give the target a minor spellblight.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:The acid or fire effects of the affected spell adhere to the creature, causing more damage the next round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2 x the spell's actual level at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell's descriptor. If a burning spell has both the fire and acid descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning spell effect. A burning spell uses up a slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

TEMPBONUS:ANYPC|COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Deflection
Concussive Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:You cause creatures to be disoriented when you affect them with a spell that has the sonic descriptor.																																																									ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:With sonic damage comes a concussive wave of energy that rattles creatures affected by the spell. A concussive spell causes creatures that take damage from a spell that has the sonic descriptor to take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the actual spell level of the spell. A concussive spell only affects spells with the sonic descriptor. A concussive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															FACT:AppliedName|Concussive

This increases the item's Price by 250 gp.  The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast consecrate or desecrate, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.
Create Sanguine Elixir				CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:ItemCreation				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brew Potion																				PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=3																																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Craft (Alchemy)=12																																																						PRESTAT:1,CHA=15																																																																						DESC:You can condense a fraction of your bloodline's power into a powerful elixir.																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. Sanguine elixirs are extremely unstable. They lose their potency 1 day after they are created.
Defending Eidolon					CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Shield Ally																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								DESC:You have trained your eidolon to protect you.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon's base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your eidolon is making an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect lasts until your eidolon's next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the eidolon, whichever occurs first.
Deny Death						CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Ki Pool	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:Your ki is so strong that it can deny death.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:As long as you have 1 ki point in your ki pool, when you fail your Constitution check to stabilize, you do not lose 1 hit point. If you succeed at the check, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 1d6 hit points. If you roll a natural 20 on the check to stabilize, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 2d6 hit points of damage instead.
Detect Expertise					CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General																																																																																																																									PRESPELL:1,Detect Chaos,Detect Evil,Detect Good,Detect Law,Detect Magic																																									PRESTAT:1,INT=13																																																																						DESC:You can detect the mystic specialty of a foe.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you use any of the spells listed in this feat's prerequisites to detect a creature's alignment or its magic, you have a chance of detecting what spellcasting expertise it has. After you observe a creature with the detect spell for 3 rounds, it must make a Will save (DC %1 plus half your caster level). If it fails the saving throw, you learn what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours.|10+INT
Die for Your Master				CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Tumor Familiar																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:Your tumor familiar goes to any length to save your life.																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:If your tumor familiar is attached, and you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the familiar throws itself in the way of the attack as an immediate action. If it makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt), it takes all the damage from the attack. If it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage. The familiar must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability, and it can only do this once per day-if it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow the familiar to make a Reflex save for half damage, its improved evasion ability does not apply on this saving throw.
Divine Interference				CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:General																																					PREMULT:1,[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=10],[PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Divine,10]																																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:You can convert a spell to interfere with an enemy's attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:As an immediate action, when an enemy within 30 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can sacrifice a prepared divine spell or (if you are a spontaneous caster) an unused spell slot and make the enemy reroll the attack roll. The second attack roll takes a penalty equal to the level of the spell you sacrifice. You must sacrifice a spell of 1st-level or higher to use this ability. Whether or not the second attack is successful, you cannot use this effect on the same creature again for 1 day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When fighting dragons, your aura of courage expands to a 20-foot-radius emanation, and allies in the aura gain a morale bonus on saving throws against dragon breath equal to your aura of courage's bonus against fear effects.
Echoing Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:You have learned how to release most, but not all, of a spell's potential when you cast it.																																																										ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When you cast an echoing spell, it does not disappear entirely from memory, and you can cast it one additional time during that day. No effect that allows you to reprepare or recast a spell can affect the echoed spell. If you prepare spells, this second casting does not require you to prepare it in another spell slot. If you spontaneously cast spells, this second casting does not expend another available spell slot.

BONUS:VAR|ImplantedBombDisableDC|11+classlevel("Alchemist")															SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:You may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.	BENEFIT:If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).	BENEFIT:Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a dispel magic spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC %1).|ImplantedBombDisabeDC

SOURCEPAGE:p.156	BENEFIT:You can combine your bardic performance and your spellcasting in two ways.	BENEFIT:First, you can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, you may combine your casting time of a spell with a Perform check. Observers must make a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by your Perform check to realize you are also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of your bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time.	BENEFIT:Second, as a move action, you can use 1 round of bardic performance to maintain a bard spell with a duration of concentration. You can cast another spell in the same round you are using bardic magic to maintain concentration; if you do this, your concentration on the maintained spell ends when you end the bardic performance the spell is part of.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:A thanatopic spell pierces defenses and immunities that protect against death effects, negative levels, and energy drain, affecting the target as if the protective barrier did not exist.	BENEFIT:For example, you could cast a thanatopic vampiric touch or enervation spell on a target under the effects of death ward, and the target would suffer the normal effect of the spell. Saving throws and SR (if any) still apply.	BENEFIT:Undead are susceptible to spells augmented by this feat, as it retunes the negative energy to be harmful to them. A thanatopic spell that would kill a living creature (such as by giving it negative levels equal to its Hit Dice) destroys an undead (though undead such as ghosts, liches, and vampires may reform as normal). Undead affected by thanatopic spells that give negative levels automatically make their saving throws to remove negative levels after 24 hours.	BENEFIT:A thanatopic spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.	BENEFIT:Normal - Defenses such as death ward negate death effects, negative levels, and energy drain. Undead are immune to these attacks.

BENEFIT:When casting an arcane spell, you may sacrifice a divine spell slot or prepared divine spell of the same or higher level as a swift action. Half the damage dealt by the arcane spell becomes holy (if you channel positive energy) or unholy (if you channel negative energy).

This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check fails, the target cannot attempt to trip you or the force effect in response. A toppling spell only affects spells with the force descriptor.

You must provide the material component for raise dead or choose to accept 1 temporary negative level; this level automatically goes away after 24 hours, never becomes a permanent negative level, and cannot be overcome in any way except by waiting for the duration to expire.

Discovery (Fast Study)			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus													PRECLASS:1,Wizard=5					DESC:You can prepare all your spells in 15 minutes.																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Normally, a wizard spends 1 hour preparing all of his spells for the day, or proportionately less if he only prepares some spells, with a minimum of 15 minutes of preparation. Thanks to mental discipline and clever mnemonics, you can prepare all of your spells in only 15 minutes, and your minimum preparation time is only 1 minute.

This discovery does not predispose any animal so addressed toward you in any way.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:You gain the ability to speak with and understand the response of any animal as if using speak with animals, though each time you speak to animals, you must decide to communicate with either amphibians, birds, fish, mammals

When creating a golem of this type, you count as having the Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, and Craft Construct feats. You must meet all other construction requirements for the golem as normal.

ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Negate Aging Penalties																SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:You discover a cure for aging, and from this point forward you take no penalty to your physical ability scores from advanced age. If you are already taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.
Discovery (Multimorph)			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus.Supernatural											PRECLASS:1,Wizard=5					DESC:Your studies in transmogrification have increased your control over shapechanging spells.																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Your studies in transmogrification have increased your control over shapechanging spells. When you cast a spell of the polymorph subschool on yourself, you may expend 1 minute of the spell's duration as a standard action to assume another form allowed by the spell. You can do this as often as you like, subject to the duration of the spell.

STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Split Slot|1	BONUS:VAR|SplitSlotTimes|1					SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you prepare spells, you may treat any one of your open spell slots as if it were two spell slots that were two spell levels lower. For example, a 9th-level wizard can split a 5th-level slot into two 3rd-level slots, preparing fireball and lightning bolt in those 3rd-level slots. For all purposes, the two lower-level slots are treated as that lower level (so the split 5th-level slot used for a fireball has a DC as if it were in a normal 3rd-level slot). Splitting a 2nd-level slot lets you prepare two additional cantrips (which you can cast over and over, just like normally prepared cantrips). This discovery has no effect on cantrips or 1st-level spells. You may split %1 spell slots when you prepare spells.|SplitSlotTimes
Discovery (True Name)			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Discovery.WizardBonus.SpellLike											PRECLASS:1,Wizard=11					DESC:You have discovered the true name of an outsider.																																											STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=1|USERINPUT|TITLE=True Name Known	SELECT:1																									SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Your researches into ancient tomes and your inquisitions of bound spirits have led you to one of the best-hidden secrets of the multiverse: the true name of an outsider-the name that defines the very essence of the creature and that gives the speaker control over the being. This outsider can have no more than 12 Hit Dice. Once per day, you can speak the common name by which the outsider is known, and the outsider travels to you as if you had cast planar binding upon it. It must obey you to the best of its ability, without pay or bargaining for its services, for its fear that you might release its true name to the wider world is enough to bring even the most recalcitrant of outsiders to bear. If the creature is within 100 feet, as a move action, you may punish it by deliberately mispronouncing its name, wracking its very essence and giving it the sickened and staggered conditions for 1 round (even if the creature is normally immune to these conditions). You cannot use true name in an area of silence, but the creature does not have to be able to hear you for it to be harmed by the ability. It is in your best interest to call this creature only sparingly, and occasionally reward it in some fashion to mollify its wrath. If you repeatedly fail to offer it a reward appropriate to its type and ethos, the creature may begin plotting ways to destroy the bond between you, whether by creating an accident that will destroy your memory of the name, by plaguing you with nuisances or dangers until you vow never to call on it again, or by actively seeking to destroy you through its own devices or those of an underling. If this creature is of a lawful type and you are violating its ethos, its superiors may even destroy it or you rather than allow you to contaminate their servant further. Worse, they may establish situations where it is necessary for you to summon this outsider, opening gateways to infernal or angelic interference, in order to gain a foothold on the Material Plane.

SOURCEPAGE:p.87	BENEFIT:Your research has unlocked a new power in conjunction with using a wand. Similar to using a magic staff, you use your own Intelligence score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against spells you cast from a wand, and you can use your caster level when activating the power of a wand if it's higher than the caster level of the wand.
