This arcane pool has %1 points. The pool refreshes once per day when you prepare your spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are holding a +%2 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.|MagusArcanePool|MagusArcanePoolBonus	DESC:These bonuses can be also used to add any of the following weapon properties: Dancing, Flaming, Flaming Burst, Frost, Icy Burst, Keen, Shock, Shocking Burst, Speed, or Vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time.

Spell Combat			KEY:Spell Combat Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																					DESC:You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action  (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Spellstrike				KEY:Magus ~ Spellstrike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																					DESC:Whenever you cast a spell with a range of "touch" from the magus spell list, you can deliver the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.

Starting at 3rd level, a magus gains one magus arcana. He gains an additional magus arcana for every three levels of magus attained after 3rd level. Unless specifically noted in a magus arcana's description, a magus cannot select a particular magus arcana more than once. Magus arcana that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from the magus spell list unless otherwise noted.

The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Knowledge Pool			KEY:Magus ~ Knowledge Pool		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																					DESC:When you prepare your magus spells, you can decide to expend 1 or more points from your arcane pool, up to your Intelligence bonus. For each point you expend, you can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in your spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If you do not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time you prepares spells, you lose those spells.

Furthermore, instead of recalling a used spell, as a swift action you can prepare a spell of the same level that you have in your spellbook. You do so by expending a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). You cannot apply metamagic feats to a spell prepared in this way.

This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast.

As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -2 penalty. You can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action.  When using the spell combat ability, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration check.

The tentacle can manipulate or hold items as well as your original arms can (for example, allowing you to use one hand to wield a weapon, the tentacle to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb). Unlike an arm, the tentacle has no magic item slots.

Tumor Familiar				KEY:Discovery ~ Tumor Familiar								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																																																				DEFINE:FamiliarMasterLVL|0																																																					DESC:You create a Diminutive or Tiny tumor on your body, usually on your back or stomach. As a standard action, you can have the tumor detach itself from your body as a separate creature vaguely resembling a kind of animal suitable for a familiar (bat, cat, and so on) and move about as if it were an independent creature. The tumor can reattach itself to you as a standard action. The tumor has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a batlike tumor can fly) and familiar abilities based on your caster level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to an alchemist). The tumor acts as your familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill bonus, the Alertness feat, and so on). When attached to you, the tumor has fast healing 5. Your extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

The arm can manipulate or hold items as well as your original arms (for example, allowing the alchemist to use one hand to wield a weapon, another hand to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb).

DESC: This haunting melody teases at the veils of understanding and drills into the bedrock of truth. Upon completing this performance, the target attempts a Will save (DC %1). Failure means you understand the target's primal nature; you gain a +4 bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence the target, and the DCs of your abilities and spells that would influence the creature or its actions (including charm and compulsion effects) increase by +2. These bonuses last for 1 day. You must have an idea of who the creature is when you begin to play the song, either through researching the creature or by observing it directly from no farther than 100 feet.

DESC: The shuffling steps, bends, and leaps of this intricate dance make you a difficult target to hit, but also make it more difficult for you to perform other actions. When using this masterpiece, you take a -%1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you must make a concentration check to cast any spell (DC 15 + the spell's level), but you gain a +%1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. You can combine this masterpiece with fighting defensively and Combat Expertise, but not total defense. When you use this masterpiece, it lasts until the start of your next turn. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide ) affect this masterpiece; this allows you to get multiple rounds of its benefit (and its penalties) at the cost of only 1 round of bardic performance.

Depths of the Mountain				KEY:Masterpiece ~ Depths of the Mountain				OUTPUTNAME:The Depths of the Mountain			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Masterpiece																			DESC:Your drumming skills can break solid rock.	DESC: Like a singer shattering a wine glass with a perfect note, your music cracks stone, shivering solid rock until it snaps. When you complete the performance, you create a tremor identical to an earthquake spell. For each round you continue to expend bardic performance rounds, the area experiences a round-long aftershock, which has the following effects.  Caves, Caverns, or Tunnels: Smaller collapses cause 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 5 half) and pin any creatures caught inside.  Cliffs: More cliffs crumble, creating a landslide that travels half as far horizontally as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 5 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble.  Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 5 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%% chance of falling into one (Reflex DC 10 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 20 feet deep, and these fissures remain open at the end of the quake.  Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned by the effects of the aftershock takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, she must make a DC 5 Constitution check or take 1d3 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.  Rivers, Lakes, or Marshes: The area drained away by the earthquake remains drained for the duration of the aftershock.  Spellcasting: The concentration DC to cast during an aftershock is 15 + the spell's level.  Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 50 points of damage. A collapsing structure deals 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures inside it (Reflex DC 5 half), and the creatures inside are pinned beneath the rubble.  Use: 10 rounds of bardic performance, +1 round for each round of aftershocks.  Action: 10 full rounds.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.22

DESC: This pantomime tells the tale of Gorroc, a foolish farmer who failed to control the weeds that grew so quickly upon his land. In desperation, Gorroc bargained with a devil, who blasted the earth with salt and withering heat, leaving the fertile land desolate for a century. When you complete the performance, you can create a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line that is blasted with scorching air and hot salt. Plants and oozes in this area take %1d%2 points of damage; half this damage is fire damage, half is piercing damage. A Reflex save (DC %3) reduces the damage by half. Creatures other than plants or oozes take half damage, or no damage on a successful save.  Use: 2 bardic performance rounds.

House of Imaginary Walls			KEY:Masterpiece ~ House of Imaginary Walls			OUTPUTNAME:The House of Imaginary Walls			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:HouseOfImaginaryWallsDC|0													DESC:You can trap opponents with the power of your acting.	DESC: You silently mime building an invisible wall, flattening your hands along linear planes to indicate its location and orientation. This "wall" is only real for creatures that see you perform this masterpiece (Will negates, DC %1); you and your allies may automatically fail your saves if you want to treat the wall as real (for example, if you want to use the wall as a bridge to cross a chasm). For creatures who believe the wall is real, it has hardness 8, 90 hit points, and a break DC of 30 (multiple believing creatures can attack the walls, breaking through it more quickly as if they were all attacking a real wall rather than each attacking separate mental constructs). This is an illusion (phantasm) effect. Because the wall is a mental image, it blocks incorporeal creatures that fail their saves (because they perceive it as a magical barrier that excludes them), though they can still go around the wall or through the floor or ceiling to bypass it. It does not affect objects or creatures immune to mental effects (which can result in situations like an archer firing through the wall but unable to physically cross it). You can create one 10-foot-square wall per use of this ability; over several rounds you can extend this square or create other walls, all of which persist until you stop using bardic performance rounds to sustain them. The wall is immobile once created. Part of the wall must be in or along the edge of your space, and you cannot create a wall that extends beyond your natural reach (though you can create a wall, move, and create another by using this ability again). Once created, the wall exists until you end your performance or affected creatures "break" it. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide) affect this masterpiece.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.  Action: 1 standard action per 10-foot square.|HouseOfImaginaryWallsDC	BONUS:VAR|HouseOfImaginaryWallsDC|10+(MasterpieceLVL/2)+CHA																		SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Legato Piece on the Infernal Bargain	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Legato Piece on the Infernal Bargain										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																			DESC:Your skilled playing can conjure up supernatural servants.	DESC: This fast-paced tune harmonizes with the magical frequencies of another plane, allowing you to draw an extraplanar creature to you and bargain for its service. When you complete this performance, you call one or more outsiders as if using planar ally. Unlike with planar ally, the creature is not necessarily associated with your deity, and has an initial attitude of "indifferent" toward you. Because it is intrigued by your performance, it remains for up to 1 minute to hear the service you are requesting and the payment you are offering. If you succeed at an opposed Charisma check against the creature (with a +0 to +6 bonus on your roll based on the nature of the service and the offered reward), it agrees to perform the service. This ability otherwise works like planar ally. Though the best-known version of this masterpiece refers to an infernal bargain, it can be used to conjure any sort of extraplanar creature (such as an archon, elemental, or protean). Other versions and arrangements of this masterpiece may have different names but otherwise identical effects.  Use: 10 bardic performance rounds.  Action: 10 minutes.

DESC: When you activate this soothing performance, one target within close range falls asleep as if affected by deep slumber (DC %1) as long as you maintain the performance. Unlike the spell (which affects weaker creatures first), this masterpiece targets a specific creature of your choice. Although this lullaby does have words, it is not a language-dependent effect.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.

DESC: As ivy climbs walls and spills across even the rockiest and most uneven of terrain, so too does your dance propel you across broken stone and up walls. As long as you maintain the performance, whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain; this allows you to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain. As long as you move laterally at least 10 feet, you may climb as if you had a climb speed equal to your base speed. You may spend the first round of this performance demonstrating the dance to up to %1 creatures; if these students succeed at a DC 15 Perform (dance) check, they also gain the benefits of this masterpiece as long as you maintain the performance.

When you complete the performance, all enemies within 30 feet who can hear your performance must save (DC %1) or take 1d6 points of damage as their pounding heart causes them to sweat blood. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are unaffected by this ability. Each round that you continue the performance adds another round to the bleed effect. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide) affect this masterpiece.

Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King		KEY:Masterpiece ~ Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King		OUTPUTNAME:The Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																			DESC:Your performance reveals ways to cheat time itself.	DESC: This piece tells the story of a mighty priest-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next 10 minutes. When you perform this masterpiece, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to perform a nonmagical action that normally requires a move action or a standard action. For example, you could make a full attack, then spend a swift action to take a normal move, load a light crossbow, or draw a weapon in the same round. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the masterpiece; otherwise the benefit is lost. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase your speed (such as haste) or alter time (such as time stop). Your allies may benefit from this masterpiece, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance, and you must expend 1 round of bardic performance for each ally other than yourself whom you want to gain the ability to accelerate time (for example, affecting yourself and five others requires expending 11 rounds of bardic performance). This is a language-dependent effect.  Use: 5 bardic performance rounds, +1 round per additional person affected.

Stone Face						KEY:Masterpiece ~ Stone Face															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																			DESC:Your antics can soften even the hardest visage.	DESC: You tell an old and humorous tale about a woman who refused to smile at anything, no matter how funny. Through a series of increasingly unlikely events involving a cart of horse manure, a king, and a flying carpet, her legendary frown broke at last. When you complete the performance, the target is affected by stone to flesh.  Use: 2 bardic performance rounds.

Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:ToccataAndFugueOfTheDanseMacabreTargets|0										DESC:Your spooky music blurs the boundaries between life and death, confusing the senses of undead creatures.	DESC: The complex notes and layered repetitions of this masterpiece bring to mind the countless dead of ages past and suffuse those who listen to it with a subtle melancholia and grim acceptance of the temporary nature of life. Starting with a trio of notes, repeated frequently and with ever-greater insistence, it becomes a whirling, head-spinning vortex of sound. Upon completing the performance, you and up to %1 allies within listening range become hidden from undead, as if under the effects of a hide from undead spell. As with hide from undead, one creature breaking the effect ends the benefit of the performance for all recipients. But by spending an additional round of bardic performance when you perform or maintain the masterpiece, you can dedicate a refrain to a particular ally; even if one ally breaks the hide from undead effect, the ally receiving the dedication remains hidden so long as he does not break the effect himself. You can dedicate a refrain multiple times in the performance (up to once per round) as long as you spend 1 round of bardic performance each time for the ally receiving a dedication.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of the performance, +1 round per ally affected, +1 round per dedicated refrain.

This masterpiece increases the affected target's base land speed by 10 feet for 1 hour. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).

DESC: This short monologue tells the story of a village priest who thought to command the gods. This so annoyed the gods of the weather that they gave him exactly what he wished for, and the priest's long-winded sermons tore apart his temple and scattered his parishioners. When you complete the performance, you conjure a great wind as if you had cast control winds.  Use: 3 bardic performance round.

When you open the bottle, the specimen animates and grows to normal size, serving you as per the spell and otherwise being treated as a summoned creature. When the duration expires, the preserved creature decays into powder. If you have the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen.

In addition, due to its tie to you, your eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. You can summon your eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, your eidolon's hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if your eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. Your eidolon remains until dismissed (a standard action). If your eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to damage, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. Your eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally.

The synthesist wears the eidolon like translucent, living armor. The eidolon mimics all of the synthesist's movements, and the synthesist perceives through the eidolon's senses and speaks through its voice, as the two are now one creature. The synthesist directs all of the eidolon's actions while fused, perceives through its senses, and speaks through its voice, as the two are now one creature. While fused with his eidolon, the synthesist uses the eidolon's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), but retains his own mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). The synthesist gains the eidolon's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the eidolon is sent back to its home plane. The synthesist uses the eidolon's base attack bonus, and gains the eidolon's armor and natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. The synthesist also gains access to the eidolon's special abilities and the eidolon's evolutions. The synthesist is still limited to the eidolon's maximum number of natural attacks. The eidolon has no skills or feats of its own. The eidolon must be at least the same size as the synthesist.  The eidolon must have limbs for the synthesist to cast spells with somatic components. The eidolon's temporary hit points can be restored with the rejuvenate eidolon spell. While fused, the synthesist counts as both his original type and as an outsider for any effect related to type, whichever is worse for the synthesist. Spells such as banishment or dismissal work normally on the eidolon, but the synthesist is unaffected. Neither the synthesist nor his eidolon can be targeted separately, as they are fused into one creature. The synthesist and eidolon cannot take separate actions.
