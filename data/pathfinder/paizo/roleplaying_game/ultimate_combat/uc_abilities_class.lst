# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type													Required Ability									Var. Min. Value					Description
Breath Weapon Bomb*	KEY:Discovery ~ Breath Weapon Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural.AlchemistBombModifier												PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,6	DESC:Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, you can draw the components, drink them, mix them within your body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from your bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = %1) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|AlchemistBombDC
Explosive Missile		KEY:Discovery ~ Explosive Missile	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,4	DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate.
Immolation Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Immolation Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural.AlchemistBombModifier												PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,3	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target's body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb's effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist's turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb's direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater.
Nauseating Flesh		KEY:Discovery ~ Nauseating Flesh	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,12	DESC:The alchemist's body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.
Poison Conversion		KEY:Discovery ~ Poison Conversion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary																PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,6	DESC:By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab.
Siege Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Siege Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Explosive Bomb	PREVARGTEQ:DiscoveryQualifyLVL,12	DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege weapon with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist's next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist's bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb's damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.

Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains %1 grit points. Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than %2, though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds, and regains grit in the following ways.&nl;Critical Hit with a Firearm ~ Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.&nl;Killing Blow with a Firearm ~ When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.|GritPoints|GritLimit																	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Display Grit Points|!PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=GritShared																																							BONUS:VAR|GritPoints|GunslingerGritPoints	BONUS:VAR|GunslingerGritLimit|WIS	BONUS:VAR|GritLimit|GunslingerGritLimit	BONUS:VAR|GunslingerGritPoints|MAX(1,WIS)	BONUS:VAR|GritPoints|GritPointsFavoredBonus/4	BONUS:VAR|GritLimit|GritLimitFavoredBonus/4							SOURCEPAGE:p.9

Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longerlasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower.

Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.

Deadeye			KEY:Gunslinger ~ Deadeye			SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL01	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL1.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary						DESC:At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm's first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first.

When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.

The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.

Pistol-Whip			KEY:Gunslinger ~ Pistol-Whip			SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL03	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL3.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary						DESC:At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a standard action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and twohanded firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/?2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.11	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds
Utility Shot		KEY:Gunslinger ~ Utility Shot			SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL03	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL3.Extraordinary									DESC:At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot. &nl;Blast Lock: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell. &nl;Scoot Unattended Object: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally. &nl;Stop Bleeding: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally							SOURCEPAGE:p.11	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds
# 7th Level
Dead Shot			KEY:Gunslinger ~ Dead Shot			SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL07	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL7.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary						DESC:At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, sheshoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7thlevel gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.

Startling Shot		KEY:Gunslinger ~ Startling Shot		SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL07	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL7.Extraordinary									DESC:At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.

Targeting			KEY:Gunslinger ~ Targeting			SORTKEY:Class_Gunslinger_Deed_LVL07	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLVL7.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary						DESC:At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects. &nl;Arms - On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit. &nl;Head - On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. &nl;Legs - On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect. &nl;Torso - Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20. &nl;Wings - On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.

To attempt to assassinate a target, the ninja must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the ninja makes a sneak attack against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the ninja as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. If the save is successful, the target still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but it is immune to that ninja's assassinate ability for 1 day.

When she does this, she throws a single shuriken at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the attack hits. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the ninja increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0).

These honor guards are sometimes merely ornamental, performing their functions on a ceremonial basis, but a surprising number are capable, deadly opponents, able to take down a threat long before their liege knows of the danger.

This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the beast rider's level as his effective druid level. The animal chosen as a mount must be large enough to carry the beast rider (Medium or Large for a Small character; Large or Huge for a Medium character). The beast rider does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat. A beast rider's mount does not gain the share spells special ability. Each time the beast rider increases in level, he can choose to select a new, more impressive mount better suited to his increased power. Small-sized beast riders can choose a pony or wolf mount at 1st level. At 4th level, a Small beast rider can also choose an allosaurus, ankylosaurus, arsinoitherium, aurochs, bison, boar, brachiosaurus, elephant, glyptodon, hippopotamus, mastodon, megaloceros, riding dog, snapping turtle (giant), triceratops, or tyrannosaurus.

To generate statistics for such a mount, apply the following modifications - Size Large; Ability Scores Str +2, Dex -2, Con +2. Increase the damage of each of the mount's natural attacks by one die size. A beast rider cannot choose a mount that is not capable of bearing his weight, that has fewer than four legs, or that has a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments). Anytime a feat or ability allows a mount to make a hoof attack, it can make a claw, slam, or other analogous attack instead.

Warding Charge			KEY:Honor Guard ~ Warding Charge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 11th level, an honor guard can flash across the battlefield to protect his ward against the target of his challenge. Whenever the target of the honor guard's challenge makes an attack against his ward, the honor guard can move up to his speed and make a single melee attack against the target of his challenge as an immediate action.

# Luring Cavalier
Far Challenge			KEY:Luring Cavalier ~ Far Challenge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:Once per day, a luring cavalier can use his far challenge ability as a swift action. When he does, the luring cavalier chooses one target within sight to challenge. The luring cavalier's ranged attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the luring cavalier's level. The luring cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. Furthermore, once per day, the luring cavalier may spend a use of his far challenge ability to double the potential extra damage of his ranged attack. Before making the attack roll, he can choose to spend a use of his challenge to deal twice his cavalier level in extra damage on a successful hit instead of just his cavalier level in extra damage. If the attack misses, the use of the challenge is wasted. Challenging a foe requires subtle deceits and strategies. The cavalier must make it look like he is a soft target. The subject of the far challenge gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls made against him. This challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious, until the target hits the luring cavalier with a melee attack, or until the combat ends. If this challenge ends because the target hits the luring cavalier with a melee attack, this challenge changes to the effects of the normal cavalier challenge, and gains any order benefit the luring cavalier has. Far challenge replaces the challenge ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Careful Aim				KEY:Luring Cavalier ~ Careful Aim			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 3rd level, when a luring cavalier makes a ranged attack with his highest base attack bonus, he can ignore the penalties for firing up to three range increments away. If he is using a firearm, he can target touch AC up to two range increments away. This effect stacks with effects that allow the cavalier to make ranged attacks farther without penalty or that allow him to target touch AC with a firearm beyond the first range increment. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Infuriating Aim			KEY:Luring Cavalier ~ Infuriating Aim		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 11th level, when a luring cavalier confirms a critical hit with a ranged attack made at his highest base attack bonus against the target of a far challenge, the target becomes infuriated for 1 round. While infuriated, the target must spend its turn moving closer to the cavalier, making move, run, or charge actions only (challenged creature's choice). This is a mind-affecting effect. This ability replaces mighty charge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Versatile Challenge		KEY:Luring Cavalier ~ Versatile Challenge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 12th level, a luring cavalier can expend a use of his challenge to gain the benefit of far challenge or the normal cavalier challenge.

# Musketeer
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Musketeer ~ Weapon And Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality										DESC:A musketeer does not gain proficiency in heavy armor. Musketeers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with firearms. A cavalier's levels stack with any fighter levels he possesses for the purpose of meeting the level prerequisite for feats that specifically select a firearm, such as Weapon Specialization.

Gifted Firearm			KEY:Musketeer ~ Gifted Firearm			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 1st level, a musketeer is gifted by his order with a firearm (either a pistol or a musket). This weapon is both a symbol of the cavalier's duty and a focus for much of his talent. He cannot sell this weapon. He also gains the Gunsmithing feat. Beginning at 8th level, the musketeer can focus himself when wielding his gifted weapon. As a standard action, he can focus himself to gain a number of benefits for 1 minute per cavalier level. The musketeer can use this ability twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th, to a total of five times per day at 20th level. At 8th level, the cavalier gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat. At 11th level, he can reduce the misfire chance of his weapon by 1 (to a minimum of 1), and at 17th level, the musketeer can double the range increment of his weapon. These abilities do not stack with the magical weapon special abilities that they duplicate. Finally, at 20th level, during a period of such focus, the musketeer can engage in a flurry of gunfire. The cavalier can expend one of his daily challenges to make a full attack with his firearm. The musketeer ignores the normal load times for his weapon, but must still expend enough doses of powder and enough bullets to complete each attack. If the musketeer's gifted firearm is destroyed, the cavalier loses this ability for 30 days while a replacement weapon is crafted for him. During this 30-day period, the musketeer takes a -1 penalty on weapon and damage rolls. The reduction of the weapon's misfire chance and the doubled range increment abilities don't stack with the similar benefits of the reliable and distance magic weapon special abilities.

Swift Powder			KEY:Musketeer ~ Swift Powder				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 4th level, the musketeer gains Rapid Reload (musket) or Rapid Reload (pistol) as a bonus feat.

Banner				KEY:Standard Bearer ~ Banner				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 1st level, a standard bearer gains the banner ability. This ability is identical to the standard cavalier's banner ability, except that the morale bonuses on saving throws against fear effects and on attack rolls made as part of a charge increase at 5th level, and every five levels thereafter.

SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Banner of Solace			KEY:Standard Bearer ~ Banner Of Solace		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 11th level, a standard bearer's banner becomes an even more potent symbol of protection and inspiration to those around him. Once per day, while his banner is displayed, the standard bearer can wave it through the air as a full-round action, granting all allies within 60 feet temporary hit points equal to 1/2 his cavalier level, and a +2 morale bonus on their next damage rolls. At 15th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1 (to a maximum of +4 at 19th level). The temporary hit points last for 10 minutes or until depleted, whichever occurs first. This ability replaces mighty charge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Awesome Pennon			KEY:Standard Bearer ~ Awesome Pennon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 20th level, a standard bearer's banner has become a powerful rallying point to his allies, and a bane to his foes. Whenever his banner is visible, allies of the standard bearer within 60 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, immunity to fear effects, and a +3 morale bonus on saving throws against mindaffecting effects.

As with tactician, allies need not meet the prerequisites of the granted feat, but they retain the use of this feat for 10 minutes plus 1 minute for every two levels the cavalier possesses, as long as the cavalier is visible and can be heard by his allies. If the cavalier falls unconscious or cannot be both seen and heard, his allies lose the benefit of the granted feat until the condition is remedied. This ability replaces expert trainer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Tactical Advantage		KEY:Strategist ~ Tactical Advantage			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 14th level, whenever a strategist uses his tactician ability to grant the use of a teamwork feat to his allies, he can move up to his speed as a free action either before or after granting the feat.

Strategic Supremacy		KEY:Strategist ~ Strategic Supremacy		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 18th level, a strategist gains the ability not only to improve his allies' abilities, but also to disrupt the teamwork of his enemies. Whenever the strategist uses the tactician ability, he can choose to cancel out the effects of one teamwork feat employed by any of his opponents within 30 feet instead of granting the use of a teamwork feat to his allies.

Once per day, when the witch hunter comes into contact with or is exposed to a spell effect or a magic item, she can spend a full-round action to examine the spell effect or magic item, and then gains the effect of a locate creature spell (Core Rulebook 305). She can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start her examination within 1 round after she experienced the spell's effect. Instead of locating a known creature, the witch hunter locates the caster of the spell effect or magic item she examined.

Redirection			KEY:Flowing Monk ~ Redirection		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MonkClassFeatures.Extraordinary.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality											DESC:At 1st level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk can attempt a reposition or trip combat maneuver against a creature that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks him.

At 8th level, a flowing monk can make both a reposition and a trip maneuver as part of a single immediate action with this ability.

At 11th level and above, the flowing monk suffers no damage on a successful save, or half damage on a failed save. If the attacker is flanking the monk, the flanking opponent who is not attacking becomes the target of the attack. Use the same attack roll, and if the attack hits the new target, that creatures takes half damage (or full damage if the attack is completely avoided). Any associated effects from the attack (such as bleed, poison, or spell effects) apply fully even if the attack deals only half damage.

###Block: Master Of Many Styles ~ Bonus Feat
#MasterOfManyStylesBonusFeat	DESC:At 1st level, 2nd level, and every four levels thereafter, a master of many styles may select a bonus style feat or the Elemental Fist feat (Advanced Player's Guide 158). He does not have to meet the prerequisites of that feat, except the Elemental Fist feat. Alternatively, a master of many styles may choose a feat in that style's feat path (such as Earth Child Topple) as one of these bonus feats if he already has the appropriate style feat (such as Earth Child Style). The master of many styles does not need to meet any other prerequisite of the feat in the style's feat path. This ability replaces a monk's standard bonus feats.																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.59

Divine Bond				KEY:Sacred Shield ~ Divine Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.Supernatural.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred shield forms a bond with her shield. As a standard action, a sacred shield can enhance her shield by calling on the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the shield to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the shield a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the shield gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the shield, stacking with existing enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities - arrow deflection, bashing, blinding, fortification (any), reflecting, and spell resistance (any). The reflecting enhancement may be used once each time the sacred shield makes use of her divine bond. Adding these armor special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 on page 485 of the Core Rulebook). These bonuses are added to any properties the shield already has, but duplicate special abilities do not grant any extra benefit. If the shield is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the shield is used by anyone other than the sacred shield, but it resumes giving bonuses if the sacred shield resumes using the shield. A sacred shield can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of four times per day at 17th level. If a shield with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred shield loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this period, the sacred shield takes a -1 penalty to her armor class and on saving throws.

Finding firearms useful for taking down large and dangerous prey, they enter the fight with the crack of black powder fire, often ranging far and wide in their safaris and searches for ever-more-dangerous denizens of the wild to track, study, appreciate-and kill. While this might strike some as going against the ranger's usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild, trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature's grand puzzle, and that the laws of the jungle-the right to kill and feed on those weaker than you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed-are both their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain.

This protector sits guard in the middle of the wilderness, keeping a lookout for any dangers that might spill from the deeper wilderness beyond, and protecting civilization from the savagery of nature-and vice versa. His long weeks, months, and sometimes years of isolation cause him to "hear" what the land is saying. Not all are crazy.

The bird can be of any type of large hunting or scavenging bird (even a vulture).

Roam (DC 15) - The falconer can let his animal companion loose to roam and forage. He must let it roam for no more than a week. When the falconer lets it roam, it agrees to return to the place he let it loose within the time period he designates.

To perform this trick, the companion must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room, but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a ?4 critical modifier when making the attack. If the bird hits, the target is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces the combat style feat the ranger gains at 6th level.																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.67

Black Market Connections	KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Black Market Connections	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RogueTalent																									DESC:A rogue with this talent gains better access to magic items from black market connections. She treats every settlement as one size greater (see Table 15-1 on page 461 of the Core Rulebook) for the purpose of determining the gp limit of the base value of items for sale, as well as the number of minor, medium, and major magic items for sale in the settlement. If the settlement is already a metropolis, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful Diplomacy check, the rogue can treat the settlement as two sizes larger. If the settlement is already a metropolis and she succeeds at the check, all magic items are for sale. If the settlement is already a large city and she succeeds at the check, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful check, the rogue can also sell stolen items on the black market. If the check fails by 5 or more, the rogue does something to spook the market, and treats the city as normal for 1 week. Furthermore, those in control of the black market may alert the authorities to the rogue's presence in an act of reprisal for spooking the market or to divert attention away from their illicit activities. The DCs of the checks are by settlement size and are given in the table below.																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Convincing Lie			KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Convincing Lie			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RogueTalent																									DESC:When a rogue with this talent lies, she creates fabrications so convincing that others treat them as truth. When a rogue with this talent successfully uses the Bluff skill to convince someone that what she is saying is true, if that individual is questioned later about the statement or story, that person uses the rogue's Bluff skill modifier to convince the questioner, rather than his own. If his Bluff skill modifier is better than the rogue's, the individual can use his own modifier and gain a +2 bonus on any check to convince others of the lie. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Charisma modifier.

But not all bandits are ruthless thugs. There are those who become outlaws in opposition to tyrants or similar oppressors. These bandits target the status quo and distribute their spoils back into the needy hands of the peasantry.

Bomb				KEY:Arcane Bomber ~ Bomb			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.Supernatural.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, the arcane bomber gains an ability nearly identical to the alchemist's bomb ability (Advanced Player's Guide 28). Unlike the alchemist, at 1st level, the arcane bomber chooses one type of energy from the following list: acid, cold, fire, and electricity. He can throw bombs of that type, but cannot modify them with discoveries. This ability stacks with the alchemist bomb ability to determine the level of bomb damage, but an arcane bomber that becomes an alchemist does not gain that class's bomb ability, nor does an alchemist that becomes an arcane bomber gain this bomb ability. This ability replaces arcane bond.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Spellblast Bombs		KEY:Arcane Bomber ~ Spellblast Bombs	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.Supernatural.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, as a swift action, an arcane bomber can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next bomb he throws during his turn. When he does, he gains a bonus to hit with the next bomb he throws before the end of his turn equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to twice the level of the spell. This ability replaces cantrips, but the arcana bomber gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook.

These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. An arcane bomber who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the arcane bomber takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools. This ability replaces arcane school.

Siege Engine Bond		KEY:Siege Mage ~ Siege Engine Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.Supernatural.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a siege mage can bond with a single siege engine within 30 feet and line of sight as a standard action. He can utilize the power of this link to aim and fire the siege engine remotely (as long as he's within 30 feet), though it still requires a crew to reload the siege engine. At 10th level, he can reload, aim, and fire the siege engine purely by the power of this link, and no longer needs a crew to control the siege engine. It still takes the normal required amount of time and actions to control a siege engine in this manner. This ability replaces arcane bond. The siege mage can end this bond with a free action. A siege mage can bond with a siege engine in this manner a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) but can only be bonded with one siege engine at a time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Empower Siege Engine	KEY:Siege Mage ~ Empower Siege Engine	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.Supernatural.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a swift action, a siege mage can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next attack he makes before the end of his turn with a siege engine he is bonded with. When he does, the siege engine attack gains a bonus on its attack roll or targeting roll equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to 3 + the level of the spell. This ability replaces cantrips, but the siege mage gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook.

# Spellslinger Abilities
Arcane Gun			KEY:Spellslinger ~ Arcane Gun			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spellslinger Gun Choice|1
Arcane Gun			KEY:Arcane Gun ~ Display			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:The spellslinger gains the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat, and one or two of his firearms can be arcane guns. Arcane guns are normal one-handed or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a spellslinger's hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time. If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired Classes through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a x3 critical hit multiplier.&nl; A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through his arcane gun. When he casts through the arcane gun, the gun's enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell's attack rolls or to the spell's saving throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells' attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger's space (spellslinger's choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.&nl; A spellslinger can attune his arcane guns at the start of each day. That attunement lasts until the spellslinger attunes to a new gun, even if a formally attuned gun is destroyed.&nl;Spellslinger Choice %1.&nl; This ability replaces arcane bond.|%LIST	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:STRING|One Gun|Two Guns	ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Firearms)
Gunsmith			KEY:Spellslinger ~ Gunsmith			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:The spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a Gunslinger (see page 9) gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a Gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun.&nl; This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.
Mage Bullets		KEY:Spellslinger ~ Mage Bullets		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DESC:A spellslinger is adept at transferring spell energy into his arcane gun attacks. As a swift action, he can sacrifice a spell and transform that energy into a weapon bonus equal to the level of the spell sacrificed on a single barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and dancing, defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, ghost touch, icy burst, merciful, seeking, shock, shocking burst, spell storing, thundering, vicious, and wounding. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements.&nl; This ability replaces cantrips, but the spellslinger gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.
