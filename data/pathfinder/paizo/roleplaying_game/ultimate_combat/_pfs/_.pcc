# Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat
# The playtest versions of the gunslinger, ninja, and samurai are no longer legal for play as of 8/4/11.
# All material from this book is legal for play except as noted below. Some rules elements are legal but function differently in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, as described.
# Gunslinger: A gunslinger's starting gun (granted by the gunsmith class feature) is worth 22 gp if sold (the average of 4d10).
#   A gunslinger begins each scenario with her Wisdom modifier in grit (or her maximum grit if she has the Extra Grit feat).
#   Any additional grit earned above her starting grit does not carry over past the scenario's conclusion.
#   The Daring Act optional rule is not used in the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign.
# Samurai: A samurai who changes his order must inform the GM of the change at the start of each scenario during the entire level in which he receives no benefits from his order, getting GM initials in the items purchased/conditions removed section of each Chronicle until he has earned 3 XP as an orderless samurai.
#   A samurai who adopts the way of the ronin must have his GM initial such a change on his Chronicle when the decision to change orders is made.
#   All samurais belonging to the Ronin order treat the three tenets of the Pathfinder Society (explore, report, and cooperate) as their edicts as outlined in Seekers of Secrets.
#   A samurai may only choose from the listed animals for his mount.
# Alchemist: The poison conversion discovery and siege bombs discovery are not legal for use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play.
