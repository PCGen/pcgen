Scatter			KEY:Special Quality ~ Scatter ~ Firearm			NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities.Firearm											COST:0		VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Scatter																						SPROP:scatter																																																																																																																																																							INFO:SPROP|A weapon with the scatter weapon quality can shoot two different types of ammunition. It can fire normal bullets that target one creature, or it can make a scattering shot, attacking all creatures within a cone. Cannons with the scatter weapon quality only fire grapeshot, unless their descriptions state otherwise. When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within a cone, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature within the cone. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A firearm that makes a scatter shot misfires only if all of the attack rolls made misfire. If a scatter weapon explodes on a misfire, it deals triple its damage to all creatures within the misfire radius.

Dry Load			KEY:Special Ability ~ Dry Load ~ Firearm / Ammunition				TYPE:FirearmCartridge													COST:30		VISIBLE:QUALIFY				SOURCEPAGE:p.141	PRETYPE:1,FirearmCartridge														SPROP:This special ability can only be applied to alchemical or metal firearm cartridges. Dry load cartridges can be used to load guns underwater or in other airless environments, such as a vacuum. This ability protects the cartridge's contents as it is being loaded and creates a residual bubble of air that surrounds the firearm, further protecting the ammunition and allowing the firearm with this ammunition to be fired in an airless environment. After the cartridge is loaded, the bubble of air lasts for 3 minutes, or until the firearm is fired, whichever occurs first. A firearm loaded with this ammunition still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls when fired underwater for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When firing a dry load cartridge underwater or in an airless environment, a misfire that results in a firearm explosion occurs normally.


# Firearm Special Abilities:

Lucky				KEY:Special Ability ~ Lucky ~ Firearm						TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:1				VISIBLE:QUALIFY				SOURCEPAGE:p.141																			SPROP:A lucky firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see page 9). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 1 grit point, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a lucky firearm has any deeds (see page 10), she can always spend 1 grit point from the lucky firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.
Lucky (Greater)		KEY:Special Ability ~ Lucky / Greater ~ Firearm					TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:3				VISIBLE:QUALIFY				SOURCEPAGE:p.141																			SPROP:A greater lucky firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see page 9). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 3 grit points, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a lucky firearm has any deeds (see page 10), she can always spend 1 grit point from the lucky firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.
Reliable			KEY:Special Ability ~ Reliable ~ Firearm						TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:1				VISIBLE:QUALIFY				SOURCEPAGE:p.141																			SPROP:A reliable firearm is enchanted so that it is less likely to jam than other firearms. This enchantment reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 1 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm.
Reliable (Greater)	KEY:Special Ability ~ Reliable / Greater ~ Firearm				TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:3				VISIBLE:QUALIFY				SOURCEPAGE:p.141																			SPROP:A greater reliable firearm is enchanted so as to be less likely to jam than other firearms. It reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 4 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm. A firearm with greater reliable cannot have the reliable special ability.

Blocking			KEY:Special Quality ~ Blocking				NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities												COST:0		VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Blocking	SOURCEPAGE:p.130																			SPROP:blocking																																																																																																																																																							INFO:SPROP|When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.
Deadly			KEY:Special Quality ~ Deadly					NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities												COST:0		VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Deadly	SOURCEPAGE:p.130																			SPROP:deadly																																																																																																																																																							INFO:SPROP|When this weapon delivers a coup de grace, it gains +4 to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.
Distracting			KEY:Special Quality ~ Distracting				NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities												COST:0		VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Distracting	SOURCEPAGE:p.130																			SPROP:distracting																																																																																																																																																							INFO:SPROP|You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon.
Grapple			KEY:Special Quality ~ Grapple					NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities												COST:0		VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Grapple	SOURCEPAGE:p.130																			SPROP:grapple																																																																																																																																																							INFO:SPROP|On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. The wielder can then attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple his opponent as a free action.

# Primitive
Fragile			KEY:Special Quality ~ Fragile					NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities												COST:0		VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Fragile	SOURCEPAGE:p.146																			SPROP:fragile																																																																																																																																																							INFO:SPROP|Fragile weapons and armor cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Armor with the fragile quality falls apart when hit with heavy blows. If an attacker hits a creature wearing fragile armor with an attack roll of a natural 20 and confirms the critical hit (even if the creature is immune to critical hits), the armor gains the broken condition. If already broken, the armor is destroyed instead. Fragile armor is not broken or destroyed by critical threats that are not generated by natural 20s, so if a creature wielding a weapon with a 19-20 or 18-20 critical range scores a critical hit on the wearer of this armor with a roll of less than a natural 20, that critical hit has no chance to break or destroy the armor. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons and armor lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description

# Galdiator
Performance			KEY:Special Quality ~ Performance				NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities												COST:0		VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.144																			SPROP:performance																																																																																																																																																							INFO:SPROP|When wielding this weapon, if an attack or combat maneuver made with this weapon prompts a combat performance check, you gain a +2 bonus on that check.
