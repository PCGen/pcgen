# Firearm Special Abilities:

Lucky				KEY:FIREARM_AS_LUCKY						TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:1									SOURCEPAGE:141																			SPROP:A lucky firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see page 9). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 1 grit point, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a lucky firearm has any deeds (see page 10), she can always spend 1 grit point from the lucky firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.
Lucky (Greater)		KEY:FIREARM_SA_LUCKY_GREATER					TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:3									SOURCEPAGE:141																			SPROP:A greater lucky firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see page 9). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 3 grit points, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a lucky firearm has any deeds (see page 10), she can always spend 1 grit point from the lucky firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.
Reliable			KEY:FIREARM_SA_RELIABLE						TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:1									SOURCEPAGE:141																			SPROP:A reliable firearm is enchanted so that it is less likely to jam than other firearms. This enchantment reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 1 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm.
Reliable (Greater)	KEY:FIREARM_SA_RELIABLE_GREATER				TYPE:OneHandedFirearm.TwoHandedFirearm								PLUS:3									SOURCEPAGE:141																			SPROP:A greater reliable firearm is enchanted so as to be less likely to jam than other firearms. It reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 4 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm. A firearm with greater reliable cannot have the reliable special ability.

# Primitive
Fragile			KEY:SPROP_FRAGILE				NAMEOPT:NOTHING	TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities												COST:0	VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Fragile	SOURCEPAGE:146																			SPROP:Fragile weapons and armor cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Armor with the fragile quality falls apart when hit with heavy blows. If an attacker hits a creature wearing fragile armor with an attack roll of a natural 20 and confirms the critical hit (even if the creature is immune to critical hits), the armor gains the broken condition. If already broken, the armor is destroyed instead. Fragile armor is not broken or destroyed by critical threats that are not generated by natural 20s, so if a creature wielding a weapon with a 19-20 or 18-20 critical range scores a critical hit on the wearer of this armor with a roll of less than a natural 20, that critical hit has no chance to break or destroy the armor. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons and armor lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description

# Galdiator
