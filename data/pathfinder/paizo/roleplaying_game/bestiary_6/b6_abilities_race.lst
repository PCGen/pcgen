##Special Abilities
#Coral Capuchin
Cursed Bite					KEY:Coral Capuchin ~ Cursed Bite		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.CoralCapuchinRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A coral capuchin's bite bestows some of the creature's benefits and weaknesses upon the victim unless the victim succeeds at a DC %1 Constitution check. The curse delivered by this bite persists for 1d6 hours, and cannot affect the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period. Affected creatures can hold their breath for double the normal amount of time, but begin drying out when exposed to air. Victims take 1d6 points of damage for every 10 minutes they are out of water, though spending a full-round action to bathe the victim in any sort of water halts this damage.|10+HD/2+CON
Moisture Dependency			KEY:Coral Capuchin ~ Moisture Dependency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.CoralCapuchinRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A coral capuchin can breathe both air and water and survive indefinitely on land, but the creature must regularly be either submerged in water or thoroughly wetted down, or else it dries out. A coral capuchin can remain out of water for %1 hours before it suffers any negative effects. After this time, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage for every hour it remains dry. Bathing the creature in water of any sort resets this time frame.|CONSCORE

#Deinotherium
Sweep						KEY:Deinotherium ~ Sweep			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DeinotheriumRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.184	DESC:A deinotherium can sweep a target with its tusks and knock the victim to the ground. As part of a charge, a deinotherium can move up to twice its base speed in a straight line and make a gore attack at any point during its movement. If this attack is successful, the target is knocked prone and the deinotherium can deal damage with its trample attack before continuing its movement.

#Devil Monkey
Puncture Armor				KEY:Devil Monkey ~ Puncture Armor		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DevilMonkeyRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:A devil monkey's fangs are devastating against armor and apparel. When a devil monkey hits with its bite, the creature bitten must succeed at a DC %1 Reflex save or the damage dealt by the bite is also dealt to any armor worn by the creature. If the target isn't wearing armor and fails this save, there's a 50%% chance the bite damage is applied to a magic item worn in the body, chest, head, or shoulders slot (determine which item is bitten randomly among all potential targets).|10+HD/2+CON

#Dunkleosteus
Gulp						KEY:Dunkleosteus ~ Gulp				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.DunkleosteusRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:A dunkleosteus can open its giant mouth in a fraction of a second, creating a vortex that draws a target in. When underwater, a dunkleosteus gains an additional 5 feet of reach with its bite attack and a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks when attempting to grapple.

#Elasmotherium
Impaling Horn				KEY:Elasmotherium ~ Impaling Horn		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ElasmotheriumRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.185	DESC:An elasmotherium's immense horn can fully impale a creature that is two or more size categories smaller than the elasmotherium (a Medium or smaller creature for the typical elasmotherium). This ability effectively adds the grab universal monster ability to the elasmotherium's gore attack against such a creature, but if the elasmotherium successfully "grabs" a foe in this manner by impaling it on the horn, the elasmotherium does not gain the grappled condition. An elasmotherium's options while grappling a foe in this way are limited-it can either move while grappling the foe, or it can whip its head and attempt to fling the foe as if using the Awesome Blow feat (the damage dealt by this is equal to its gore damage). An elasmotherium can impale only one creature at a time with its horn, but can continue to attack normally with its gore.

#Kentrosaurus
Defensive Spikes				KEY:Kentrosaurus ~ Defensive Spikes		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.KentrosaurusRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At the end of its turn, a kentrosaurus can crouch down and splay its back and shoulder spikes. It cannot make attacks of opportunity when using its defensive spikes in this way, but until its next turn any creature that attacks the kentrosaurus with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons, or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 points of piercing damage unless it succeeds at a DC %1 Reflex saving throw.|10+HD/2+DEX
Impaling Strike				KEY:Kentrosaurus ~ Impaling Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.KentrosaurusRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:A kentrosaurus's tail is a primary attack that deals piercing damage and has a x3 critical damage multiplier.

#Mockingfey
Mock						KEY:Mockingfey ~ Mock				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MockingfeyRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.189	DESC:As a standard action, a mockingfey can take on the appearance of any creature it can see. This functions like veil, but affects only the mockingfey. The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it's mimicking is larger than itself, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version of it. Anyone interacting with this effect can attempt a DC %1 Will save to see through the ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a guise indefinitely, but can't change to a form other than its own without a visual reference-once a given disguise has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form.|10+HD/2+CHA

#Mokele-Mbembe
Whip Tail					KEY:Mokele-Mbembe ~ Whip Tail			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MokeleMbembeRacialTrait				SOURCEPAGE:p.190	DESC:When not submerged, a mokele-mbembe can crack its tail like a whip as a standard action, creating a sonic boom in a 5-foot burst up to 20 feet away. Any creature in the burst's area must succeed at a DC %1 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. Mokele-mbembes are immune to this sonic effect.|10+HD/2+CON
