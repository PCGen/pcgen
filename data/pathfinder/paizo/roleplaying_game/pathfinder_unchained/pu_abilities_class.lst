When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what's already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).

At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made.

A monk's attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well. A monk's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. The damage dealt by a monk's unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1-2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks.

The number of points in a monk's ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects.

Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type.

Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency						KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality																								DESC:Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.

Spells									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality									VISIBLE:DISPLAY	DEFINE:UnchainedSummoner|0								DESC:A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner's spell list on page 39 is different from that presented in the Advanced Player's Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner's spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner's Charisma modifier. A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook). A summoner's selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner's choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1-5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1-5 are fixed.) Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known. A summoner doesn't need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.																																																																																																																																																																				BONUS:VAR|UnchainedSummoner|1																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Cantrips									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Cantrips				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality																								DESC:A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Eidolon									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Eidolon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Eidolon																						DESC:A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon's hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished. The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner's desires. The eidolon's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner's class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner's class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner. The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner's forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).

Life Link									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Life Link				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Life Link																				DESC:At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.

Summon Monster I								KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Summon Monster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike.Summon Monster.Summon Monster SLA				DEFINE:SummonerSummonMonsterLVL|0	DEFINE:SummonerSummonMonsterTimes|0	DESC:At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner's spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.

Bond Senses									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Bond Senses			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Bond Senses																				DESC:At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Shield Ally									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Shield Ally			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Shield Ally																			DESC:At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Maker's Call								KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Maker's Call			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Makers Call																				DESC:At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner's caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Transposition								KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Transposition			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Transposition																			DESC:At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker's call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Aspect									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Aspect				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aspect																				DESC:At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon's evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon's evolutions.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Greater Shield Ally							KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Greater Shield Ally		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Greater Shield Ally																		DESC:At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner's eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Life Bond									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Life Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Life Bond																				DESC:At 14th level, the summoner's life becomes linked to his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don't deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don't deal damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Merge Forms									KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Merge Forms			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Merge Forms																				DESC:At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire). The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon's actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice. The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Greater Aspect								KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Greater Aspect			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Greater Aspect																			DESC:At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon's evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Twin Eidolon								KEY:Unchained Summoner ~ Twin Eidolon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Summoner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Twin Eidolon																			DESC:At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon's evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.
