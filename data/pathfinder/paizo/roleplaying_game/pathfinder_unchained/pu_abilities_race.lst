# Ability Name		Unique Key									Category of Ability		Type											Visible		Description																																																																																																																Source Page
Darkvision			KEY:Unchained Eidolon Companion ~ Darkvision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Companion.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:DISPLAY	DESC:The eidolon has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.
Link				KEY:Unchained Eidolon Companion ~ Link				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Companion.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:A summoner and his eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the summoner to give orders to his eidolon at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the summoner's connection to his eidolon. As a result, the summoner and his eidolon share magic item slots. For example, if the summoner is wearing a ring, his eidolon can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the summoner remain active, and those used by the eidolon become dormant. The eidolon must possess the appropriate appendages to use a magic item.	SOURCEPAGE:p.
Share Spells		KEY:Unchained Eidolon Companion ~ Share Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Companion.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:The summoner can cast a spell with a target of "you" on his eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on himself. A summoner can cast spells on his eidolon even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the eidolon's type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner spell list. This ability does not allow the eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.
Evasion			KEY:Unchained Eidolon Companion ~ Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Companion.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:If the eidolon is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw.																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.

Multiattack			KEY:Unchained Eidolon Companion ~ Multiattack			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Companion.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:An eidolon gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks (or it is reduced to fewer than three attacks), the eidolon instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a -5 penalty. If the eidolon later gains three or more natural attacks, it loses this additional attack and instead gains Multiattack.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.
Improved Evasion		KEY:Unchained Eidolon Companion ~ Improved Evasion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Companion.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an eidolon takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw and only half damage if it fails.

Agathion		KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Agathion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Patient and enlightened liaisons of the good-aligned Outer Planes, agathion eidolons seek to vanquish evil and protect that which is good. Agathion eidolons always have aspects of a single animal or creature, rather than a hodgepodge of several. Though they have patience for summoners with unorthodox methods and even those who stray from the path of good, they will not brook their powers being used for evil ends. An agathion eidolon seeks to bring its summoner closer to its own enlightenment.

Angel			KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Angel		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Hailing from the higher planes, angel eidolons are creatures of exquisite beauty. They usually appear in idealized humanoid forms, with smooth skin, shining hair, and bright eyes. Angel eidolons are impeccably honorable, trustworthy, and diplomatic, but they do not shy away from confrontation when facing off against evil and its minions.

Archon		KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Archon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Summoned from heaven, archon eidolons are the embodiments of righteousness. They often take on powerful, graceful forms, rippling with muscles but refined in their movements. Archon eidolons are totally dedicated to the cause of good, and have little patience for those who violate their oaths and ideals-including the summoner who called them. Archons will do whatever it takes to stop the advance of evil and protect the innocent.

Azata			KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Azata		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Embodiments of the untamable beauty and noble passion of Elysium, azata eidolons have wild and beautiful features. They often take graceful forms reminiscent of elves or fey, but they occasionally appear like lillends, with serpentine tails. Azata eidolons are flighty and independent, and they often have their own ideas about how to defeat evil or have a good time. Thus, an azata eidolon is likely to balk if its summoner commands it to perform offensive or nefarious actions. On the other hand, an azata eidolon in sync with its summoner is a passionate and devoted companion.

Daemon		KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Daemon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:The agents of horrible deaths, daemon eidolons desire the utter annihilation of all things. Their forms vary wildly depending on which type of death they embody, and daemon eidolons sometimes represent a more obscure kind of death than the most famous daemons. Daemon eidolons wish to sow death and misery through a variety of means. Most are capable of seeing the big picture, and will obediently follow even a neutral summoner. Ending lives is a typical part of an adventurer's career, so following along with a summoner gives a daemon eidolon many opportunities to gather mortal soul energy for its own dark and inscrutable purposes.

Demon			KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Demon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Raw destruction given material substance, demon eidolons form out of the Abyss's stew of soul energy, leading some scholars to speculate that the summoner's arts are related to the magical tampering that gave rise to the first demons. Demon eidolons revel in causing destruction and inflicting suffering, and they will do so for their summoners without question, taking pleasure in whatever havoc they can create. For a demon eidolon, the means justify the ends.

Devil			KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Devil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Corruptors, tempters, and despoilers, devil eidolons often serve their summoners obediently and efficiently, all in a long-term attempt to damn the summoner's soul to the deepest depths of Hell. While some types of devils have truly unusual forms, devil eidolons have found that the more traditional bipedal form allows them to build up a strong rapport with their summoners-and consequently to corrupt them-more easily than if they possessed a more monstrous appearance.

Div			KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Div		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Formed of hatred and spite, div eidolons seek to despoil and ruin all things beautiful and joyous. Div eidolons particularly resent having mortal masters, and seek to doom their summoners to existences full of suffering and loss. Each div eidolon has a unique compulsion it must follow-usually something similar to the doru's obsession with secrets-that leads it to bargain its loyalty for something the summoner provides. The div's summoner uses his eidolon's compulsion to entrap and control the eidolon. Still, div eidolons never fully give in, and continue to plot ways they might corrupt that which their masters hold dearest.

Elemental		KEY:Eidolon Subtype ~ Elemental	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Eidolon Subtype Selection	DESC:Pulled in from one of the four elemental planes, these eidolons are linked to one of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. Generally, an elemental eidolon appears as a creature made entirely of one element, but there is some variation. Elemental eidolons are decidedly moderate in their views and actions. They tend to avoid the conflicts of others when they can and seek to maintain balance. The only exception is when facing off against emissaries of their opposing elements, which they hate utterly.

When they deal with the world of mortals, psychopomp eidolons nearly always wear masks. They do not tolerate summoners who traffic with daemons, undead, and other entities that interfere with the transmigration of souls, but otherwise they are comfortable with most actions on the summoner's part. When the summoner dies, a psychopomp eidolon personally escorts him to the afterlife and serves as an expert witness when it is time for him to be judged.
