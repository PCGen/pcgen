Black Cloud			KEY:Achaierai ~ Black Cloud	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:BlackCloudDC|0					DESC:An achaierai can exhale a cloud of choking, toxic smoke three times per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately take 2d6 points of damage as their flesh melts and rots away. The cloud erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black cloud must also make a DC %1 Fortitude save or become confused. Every round, the victim may attempt another DC %2 Fortitude save to recover from the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the condition is removed or the victim eventually makes her saving throw. The confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. This is a poison effect.

Soul Siphoning		KEY:Aeon ~ Soul Siphoning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:SoulSiphoningDC|0				DESC:As a swift action, an akhana can use its tail to siphon life essence from a grappled foe. At the start of the aeon's turn, the victim gains 1d4 negative levels (a DC %1 Fortitude save negates and grants immunity to this akhana's soul siphoning ability for 24 hours). When the number of negative levels equals the target's Hit Dice, the target's soul tears free from its mortal body and gets stored within the body of the akhana as a trap the soul spell. The victim's body remains preserved as if via a gentle repose spell for as long as the soul is held by the akhana. The akhana can keep the soul indefinitely, or can release it as a full-round action. Upon doing so, the released soul immediately returns to its body if the body is within 300 feet, at which point the body returns to life and any negative levels imparted to it by the akhana are removed. If the body is not within 300 feet (or if it has been destroyed), then the creature dies when its soul is released. A miracle, limited wish, or wish can force a displaced soul to return to its proper body. If an akhana is slain, any soul it contains is released automatically. An akhana can only hold one soul at a time.|SoulSiphoningDC	BONUS:VAR|SoulSiphoningDC|10+HD/2+CON						SOURCEPAGE:p.9

The sphere can travel in any direction, but must remain within 300 feet of the pleroma or it immediately dissipates. Wherever the sphere travels, it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain (such as swamp, tundra, desert, or forest) or a 10-foot-square wall composed of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood, or stone). Any existing matter, either living or nonliving that comes in contact with the sphere must make a DC %1 Fortitude save or be absorbed and incorporated into the new substance (only freedom, miracle, or wish can rescue creatures so trapped).

The sphere is an empty void similar to a sphere of annihilation. Any matter (living or nonliving) that touches the sphere must succeed on a DC %1 Fortitude save or be sucked into the sphere and destroyed. Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact with the sphere. By concentrating, the pleroma can control this sphere, causing it to fly slowly at a speed of 10 feet per round. The sphere can travel in any direction, but must remain within 300 feet of the pleroma or it immediately dissipates. The sphere is highly unstable and only lasts 1d4 minutes before harmlessly imploding upon itself. Alternatively, the pleroma may hurl the sphere as a ranged touch attack (with a 10-foot range increment) against a single creature. When thrown in this manner, the sphere implodes immediately after the attack is resolved.|SphereofOblivionDC																											BONUS:VAR|SphereofOblivionDC|10+HD/2+CON						SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Any intelligent creature struck by this cone must make a DC %1 Will save or become nearly overwhelmed with the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in store for him. There is no way to make sense of these myriad dooms and boons, and as a result, the victim is staggered. As long as this condition persists, the victim may choose to make two rolls when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check, he must accept the worse of the two rolls, but in so doing the wreath of fate passes from his soul and he is no longer staggered by this ability. Wreath of fate is a curse effect, and as such can be affected by remove curse or break enchantment, the effective caster level of this curse is %2.|WreathofFateDC|WreathofFateCL																																																											BONUS:VAR|WreathofFateDC|10+HD/2+CHA	BONUS:VAR|WreathofFateCL|HD	SOURCEPAGE:p.14

Corporeal Instability		KEY:Chaos Beast ~ Corporeal Instability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DEFINE:ChaosBeastCorporealInstabilityDC|0	DESC: Claw - contact (curse); save Fort DC %1; effect amorphous body and 1 Wisdom drain per round (see below); cure 3 consecutive saves.  A creature cursed with an amorphous body becomes a spongy, shapeless mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape constantly melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, helmets, and rings become useless. Large items worn or carried - armor, backpacks, even shirts - hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. The victim gains the amorphous quality, but cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (?4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50%% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).  A victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Will save (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change the victim's shape (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and polymorph) do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent additional Wisdom drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange and stoneskin have a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shape - upon being drained to 1 Wisdom, further Wisdom drain ceases and the amorphous body effect is permanent until removed via magic (no further number of saving throws can cure the condition at this time).|ChaosBeastCorporealInstabilityDC	ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Corporeal Instability	BONUS:VAR|ChaosBeastCorporealInstabilityDC|10+TL/2+CON	BONUS:VAR|ChaosBeastCorporealInstabilityDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Corporeal Instability)	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(claw)

A jinkin can take part in a tinkering only once per day, and may only tinker with a creature or object that isn't already cursed.

As a full-round action, the gryph extends an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrates the victim's flesh by making a successful sting attack (+5 melee).  On a hit, the ovipositor deals 1 point of damage and implants 1d4 eggs in the victim.  The eggs draw nutrients from the target's flesh, and give the target the sickened condition.  The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous gryph chicks that immediately burrow out of the victim's body.  This deals 2 points of Constitution damage per gryph chick, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away (if needed, use game statistics for a bat familiar to represent a hatchling).  Removing implanted eggs requires a DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of damage.

It can only wield one such weapon at a time - it must use its other legs to walk.  If a Leng spider drops or loses a web weapon, it can create a new one as a full-round action, provided it has access to heavy-weight objects of the correct size (such as loose rocks or skulls).

Creating a gate to bring allies to the Material Plane requires one sacrifice for every HD of the creature intended to pass through the gate (so five sacrifices can bring a lurker or a Medium air elemental, eight can bring a Large earth elemental, and so on).

Enthralled creatures behave in one of the following four ways, which the siren chooses when she begins singing.  Captivation: This functions exactly like a harpy's captivating song (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 172).  Fascination: Affected creatures are fascinated.  Obsession: An obsessed creature becomes defensive of the siren and does all he can to prevent harm from coming to her, going so far as attacking his allies in her defense.  The victim is not controlled by the siren, but views her as a cherished ally.  This is a charm effect.  Slumber: The victim immediately falls asleep, rendering the creature helpless.  While the siren is singing, no noise will wake the sleeping creature, though slapping or wounding him does.
