Vortex								KEY:Water Elemental ~ Vortex						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.AttackOption														DEFINE:VortexDuration|0	DEFINE:VortexHeight|0	DEFINE:VortexDC|0	DESC:While underwater, a water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. The vortex is always 5 feet wide at its base. A vortex's width at its peak is always equal to half of its height. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet and at most %1 feet high. The vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the vortex moves into or through a creature's space. In vortex form the elemental cannot make its normal attacks, and does not threaten the area around it. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the vortex might take damage when caught in the vortex (generally damage equal the elementals slam attack). An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %2) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take damage as if it were hit by the elemental's slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the vortex, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the vortex carries them or to escape the vortex. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the vortex take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The vortex can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume. The vortex can eject any carried creatures whenever you wish as a free action, depositing them in the elemental's space. If the vortex's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the Vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|VortexHeight|VortexDC																					ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Vortex																		BONUS:VAR|VortexDuration|HD/2	BONUS:VAR|VortexHeight|0	BONUS:VAR|VortexDC|10+(HD/2)+STR	BONUS:VAR|VortexDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Vortex)																					SOURCEPAGE:p.126	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(DC %1)|VortexDC
