Gaze Reflection				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=10						PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mesmerist ~ Mesmerist Tricks,Mesmerist ~ Bold Stare		PRETEXT:Spellcraft 10 ranks, bold stare and mesmerist tricks class features.		DESC:The power of your psychic stare wards you from the potent gazes of your enemies.	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:When you avert your eyes from a creature with a gaze attack (including one produced by a spell like eyebite or burning gaze or by a magic item), you can roll twice and select the better result when checking to see whether you are exposed to that gaze attack and when rolling your miss chance on attacks made against that creature (the latter doesn't stack with Blind-Fight). In addition, as a swift action, you can expend one mesmerist trick to make yourself immune to that creature's gaze until the beginning of your next turn. If you expend two mesmerist tricks instead, you gain immunity to that creature's gaze and also reflect its gaze back at it, affecting it with its own gaze. [Special] A mesmerist's hypnotic stare, a witch's or hag's evil eye, and a vampire's dominate ability are treated as gaze attacks for the purpose of this feat, as are abilities that are triggered when looking at a creature, such as a nymph's blinding beauty or a sea hag's horrific appearance. Spending two mesmerist tricks on this feat does not bypass any immunity the creature might have to its own gaze, such as a vampire's immunity to mind-affecting effects or the fact that the nymph's blinding beauty works only on humanoids.

Legendary Influence			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Medium ~ Spirit																		PRETEXT:Lesser spirit power class feature.							DESC:Each legend grants you more of its power in return for greater influence.		SOURCEPAGE:p.86	BENEFIT:Immediately select one feat (other than an item creation feat) for each spirit you can channel. Whenever you perform a seance to channel a spirit, you can allow the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you to gain access to that spirit's Legendary Influence feat for as long as you channel that spirit. You can use this bonus feat as a prerequisite for any feats granted by a spirit power (such as the champion's legendary champion ability), but not for any other feats.
