Sage Counselor					KEY:Unchained Monk Archetype ~ Sage Counselor		CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.MonkArchetype							PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=CLASS,Monk ~ Unchained Class				SOURCEPAGE:p.67		DESC:Sage counselors are ascetics and mystics who leave the confines of the monastery walls to advise secular people about spiritual truths and to seek knowledge of the outside world.
