A hallucinogen follows all the normal rules and restrictions for an alchemist's mutagen as if they were the same substance, just as a cognatogen does.

Drug Lore				KEY:Hallucinist ~ Drug Lore									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Investigator Class Features.HallucinistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																									DESC:A hallucinist has a deep understanding and appreciation of drugs. If the hallucinist spends 1 minute physically examining a drug, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural drug or a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical drug (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC). Once he identifies a drug, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the drug. Success renders the dose harmless. The hallucinist has no chance of accidentally drugging herself when examining or attempting to neutralize a drug.

By expending 10 minutes of the duration of his hallucinogen or one use of inspiration, he can create an effect similar to minor image or oneiric horror (DC %1).|10+InvestigatorLVL/2+INT	DESC: He can also create an effect similar to synesthesia (DC %1).

Simultaneous Study		KEY:Hallucinist ~ Simultaneous Study							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Investigator Class Features.HallucinistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																									DESC:At 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, the expanded mind of a hallucinist is able to maintain his studied combat bonuses against an additional target at the same time. In order to do so, the hallucinist must be using his psychedelic perception ability and must expend one use of inspiration in order to designate each target beyond the first target (this cost stacks with the use of inspiration required to designate a target more than once per 24 hours). He still needs to take a move action for each target, designating them one at a time. The hallucinist can discard this connection to a target of studied combat as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place. This ability alters studied combat.

This functions as the meld into stone spell, except it can work on any willing creature, not just you, and it lasts for %1 minutes or until you use earthmeld again. The melded creature, not you, decides when to step out of the stone. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration of an earthmeld until the next time you recover burn. Such increased earthmelds don't end if you use earthmeld again, allowing you to maintain multiple earthmelds.|KineticistLVL*10																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.66
Flame Trap				KEY:Wild Talent ~ Flame Trap									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent																																																																																																																																	PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Fire,2																									DESC:Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 2; Burn 0 - You lay a fiery trap on a container, ensuring the destruction of sensitive documents while punishing those who would steal your secrets. In order to weave the trap, you must spend 10 minutes in contact with the container you wish to trap. At the end of that time, the container is trapped until the next time you use this wild talent or until it triggers. Any creature other than you who opens the container takes damage as from your fire blast (or blue flame blast, if you have it). The damage affects the creature automatically if it is touching the container, but if it opens the container from within 30 feet, it can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage, and if it opens the container from farther still, it takes no damage. Whether or not the creature that opened the container takes damage, your kinetic blast damage also affects any items within the container that you choose, as well as the container, if you wish it, and leaves all other items undamaged. This counts as a magical trap with a Perception and Disable Device DC of %1. You can accept 1 point of burn when using flame trap to make a new trap without dismissing any previous traps. If you do, the trap lasts until the next time you recover burn.|10+KineticistLVL/2+DEX																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.66
Touchsight, Spying		KEY:Wild Talent ~ Spying Touchsight								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Touchsight																																																																																																							PRETEXT:Prerequisite touchsight		PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Aether,4																									DESC:Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0 - You attach a sticky strand of invisible aether to a target and then project your senses along the strand, allowing you to spy on that target. Attaching the strand of aether requires a ranged touch attack, but if you activate this ability while your target is under the effect of your touchsight, you can use the strands from your touchsight instead. Once you have activated spying touchsight, you can concentrate on it to spy on your target with any of your five senses (though your own body no longer benefits from the senses you project); the strand lasts as long you concentrate, though you can switch which senses you are projecting each round. A creature using see invisibility or a similar effect can notice the trailing strand of aether and follow it back to you. A creature can break your spying touchsight by dispelling it, but otherwise, the only way to break the strand is if one of you uses a teleportation effect, moves more than 1 mile from the other, or is completely blocked from the other in all directions (such as if one of you were inside a telekinetic sphere).

You can use voice of the wind to create unusual sounds, as ghost sound, to throw your voice, as ventriloquism, and even to alter your voice, as vocal alteration. You can send messages at a much greater distance than before and at a faster rate. When using voice of the wind's whispering wind effect, you can choose to have the wind rise high into the sky, where it can gust at 50 miles per hour before descending to deliver the message. While the gust is still small, abnormal wind that fast is noticeable, unlike the normal gentle zephyr from whispering wind. If you choose to use the faster gust, you can deliver a message as far as %1 miles, instead of %2 miles.|KineticistLVL*50|KineticistLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.66
Watersense, Greater		KEY:Wild Talent ~ Watersense (Greater)							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Watersense																																																																																																							PRETEXT:Prerequisite watersense		PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Water,5																									DESC:Element water; Type utility (Su); Level 5; Burn 0 - You project your watersense outward through the tides and water around you, allowing you to spy on others at a distance. You can take 10 minutes to project your senses, choosing a location within 480 feet that is connected to your current location via the same continuous body of water, or you can take 1 hour to attempt to spy on a specific creature within %1 miles that is visible from a location connected to your current location via the same continuous body of water. In the latter case, the creature receives a Will save as per scrying (including bonuses and penalties based on connection and knowledge); a target that saves is immune to your greater watersense for 24 hours. In either case, an extremely thin funnel of water, lasting for %1 minutes, carries light and sound to your location, where your target area or location appears in the water next to you and you can view it as if through a scrying sensor, allowing you to both see and hear the area immediately surrounding the other end of the funnel. In the case of a distance greater than 480 feet, the sound comes 1 round later than its corresponding visual information for every mile away you are (for instance, if you were 5 miles away, you would see your target start talking 5 rounds before you heard what it said). When you are tracking a creature, the funnel moves as best it can through the water to follow that creature, up to 150 feet per round, but the target can escape by simply moving away from the water. If you also possess the voice of the wind wild talent, you can use its message effect to send your voice through the funnel with a delay of 1 round per mile. This wild talent is a divination and scrying effect.|KineticistLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.66

The eyeball familiar functions similarly to the tumor familiar alchemist discovery (Ultimate Magic) except as follows. The eyeball familiar does not have fast healing. The eyeball familiar doesn't resemble an animal, and its size is Fine for a Medium or smaller eyebiter (or one size category larger for every size category the eyebiter is larger than Medium). It has a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability) and no physical attacks (though it can still deliver touch spells once the eyebiter has reached 3rd level). The eyeball has a Strength score of 1, a Dexterity score of 12, and Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10. It has no set Hit Die, base saves, or skill ranks of its own, though it uses its master's when a familiar normally would. It doesn't grant its master any familiar bonus, nor can it ever be an improved familiar. Whenever the eyebiter's eyeball familiar leaves his body, he is dazzled until it returns (if it is destroyed, the eyebiter loses that eye until he gains the effects of a regeneration).

This means that she gains orisons instead of knacks. This doesn't change her number of spells per day or spells known. The fey trickster's mesmerist spells and spell-like abilities count as if they were fey spell-like abilities for the purpose of effects like resist nature's lure that apply against fey spell-like abilities.

Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. At 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute.|3+CHA	DESC: At 6th level, she can change the ally's form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self, but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn't allow a saving throw to disbelieve).|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=6	DESC: At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projection.|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=10	DESC: At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour.

Assume Knowledge			KEY:Thought Eater ~ Assume Knowledge							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.ThoughtEaterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																										DESC:The thought eater can choose one Knowledge skill possessed by the target of his hypnotic stare. He uses the target's number of ranks in that skill, instead of his own, to calculate his bonus (but not for other purposes, such as meeting the prerequisites of feats) to a maximum number of ranks equal to his mesmerist level.

Consume Identity			KEY:Thought Eater ~ Consume Identity							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.ThoughtEaterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																										DESC:When the thought eater kills a target of his hypnotic stare, he can choose to entirely consume the creature's identity, mind, body, and soul as a free action. The target's corpse dissolves and as long as the thought eater lives, the target of consume identity cannot be brought back from the dead until the thought eater releases the identity (a standard action) or uses consume identity on another target. The creature's soul can also be released by a wish or miracle (which ends the effect of consume identity). When the thought eater has consumed an identity, all divination spells identify him as (and consider him to be) the creature whose identity he consumed rather than himself. This ability fools any spell short of discern location. Discern location pinpoints the thought eater's location, whenever either the thought eater or the consumed creature is the target of that spell.

Allies with mesmerist tricks implanted by the vizier take penalties on Will saves made to resist the vizier's abilities and spells, and on Diplomacy, Intimidate, Sense Motive checks attempted against the vizier. This penalty equals that imposed by the vizier's hypnotic stare. If the vizier uses his hypnotic stare against such an ally, these penalties stack.

Power Behind the Throne		KEY:Vizier ~ Power Behind the Throne							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.VizierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																											DESC:The vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn't contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier's spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers' memories and perception of the spell's casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier's allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC %1) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell's casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally's implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own.|10+MesmeristLVL/2+CHA	DESC: The vizier doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calm spell.

Compelling Voice			KEY:Vox ~ Compelling Voice									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.VoxClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																											DESC:A vox can focus the sound of his voice on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, sapping that target's willpower and rendering her more vulnerable to mind-affecting powers, rather than using a stare like other mesmerists. A vox can use his compelling voice even while deafened, but it has a 20%% chance to fail, just like casting a spell with a verbal component. The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox's voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox's compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist's hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.

Second, he can use those contacts to gather information for him (as per the Diplomacy skill to gather information) without spending the time himself, rather than asking a question and receiving a result similar to a divination. He can ask more questions over the same time period as normal with outside contact, for a total of %1 questions that are in some way related to one another.|(OccultistLVL-4)/4	DESC: Instead of delivering messages and objects, the courtly contacts can spread vicious rumors and gossip about a target throughout a settlement, causing any creatures in the settlement whose attitude toward the target wasn't helpful to have its attitude toward the target worsened by one step.

Broker Secrets			KEY:Secret Broker ~ Broker Secrets								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Features.SecretBrokerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																										DESC:A secret broker can trade her secrets to another. For the purpose of this ability, an object's secret is composed of pieces of information gained from a single object through object reading, object seer, psychometry, or read object that the occultist didn't otherwise know and hasn't shared with another, written somewhere, or otherwise recorded or found a way to recover should she forget them and lose possession of the object. The secret broker can willingly use this ability in tandem with handing the object over to another creature in order to transfer the object's secret to that creature. The secret broker forgets the object's secret and the creature instantly learns the object's secret. The secret broker can also destroy an object to remove his memory of the object's secret without transferring it to another. In either case, any onlookers who understand what the secret broker is doing, and the recipient in the case of a transfer, can intrinsically tell that the secret broker has used this ability rather than simply sharing the memory through other means or destroying the object but keeping its secret.

This works as her share memory ability, except it allows her to access memories from unwilling targets. A target that succeeds at its saving throw against a secret broker's steal secret ability is forever after immune to that secret broker's steal secret ability. While this ability replaces magic circles, the secret broker can still use outside contact, though she leverages the outsider's secrets rather than create a circle. It still takes 1 minute to call it (the same length of time it normally takes to draw the circle) and costs 2 points of mental focus, even though she isn't using magic circles.

Erase Secret			KEY:Secret Broker ~ Erase Secret								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Features.SecretBrokerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																																																																																																																																																										DESC:A secret broker can expend 1 point of mental focus from her divination implement in order to erase a fact from someone's mind by touch. This works similarly to modify memory to erase the memory of an event, except the effect is instantaneous and leaves no magical trace (it can still be removed by break enchantment, psychic surgery, limited wish, miracle, or wish) and the secret broker can remove only one fact, such as "The queen and the general are having an affair" rather than a 5-minute event. Erasing the memory of a fact does not prevent the target from learning the fact again, or even potentially from deducing the fact again from evidence, given time.

Shade					KEY:Shadow Caller ~ Shade									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Features.ShadowCallerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																																																																																																																																											DESC:A shadow caller gains a special kind of phantom known as a shade. A shade functions as a phantom, except as noted below. A shade is from the Shadow Plane instead of the Ethereal Plane. A shade is not confined to the shadow caller's consciousness, but instead inhabits her shadow. This ability alters phantom.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Inhabit Shadow			KEY:Shadow Caller ~ Inhabit Shadow								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Features.ShadowCallerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																									DESC:A shade resides within a shadow caller's own shadow. When the shade is summoned, the shadow caller does not cast a shadow under any circumstances. Creatures that don't normally cast shadows (such as vampires) cannot be shadow callers. While the shade inhabits its master's shadow, the shadow caller gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks against creatures without darkvision or the see in darkness ability; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +8. Additionally, the shadow caller gains darkvision 60 feet while her shade inhabits her shadow. If the shadow caller already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

Shadow Bound			KEY:Shadow Caller ~ Shadow Bound								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Features.ShadowCallerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																									DESC:A shadow caller's shade remains stable while adjacent to the shadow caller, or while up to 5 feet away from the shadow caller for every 5 levels the shadow caller possesses. If the shade moves beyond this distance, it is automatically dismissed back to the Shadow Plane (preventing the shade from being summoned back for 24 hours) unless the shadow caller concentrates as per the etheric tether ability. However, if both the shadow caller and shade are in areas of total darkness, the shade can move any distance from the shadow caller. If the shade is beyond its maximum distance and enters an area of dim or brighter illumination, it immediately returns to the Shadow Plane and cannot be summoned for 24 hours.

Additionally, the shadow caller's square and all adjacent squares are treated as areas of dim illumination while she benefits from this ability; this second effect counts as a 4th-level darkness spell for the purpose of adjudicating light and darkness effects.

It uses its Hit Dice as its caster level, and the DC for these spells equals 10 + 1/2 the shade's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier. Instead of the normal spell level and percentage of reality for the two spells, the maximum spell level of the duplicated spell is 4th level, and the effects are 40%% real.

#Zeitgeist Binder
Zeitgeist				KEY:Zeitgeist Binder ~ Zeitgeist								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Features.ZeitgeistBinderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																									DESC:A zeitgeist binder's phantom is called a zeitgeist. In addition to an emotion, a zeitgeist is tied to one aspect of its settlement: corruption, crime, economy, law, lore, or society (GameMastery Guide p204). In order to select an aspect, that aspect of the settlement must have a positive modifier (for instance, a settlement with a negative lore modifier or a modifier of 0 could not manifest a lore zeitgeist). Although a zeitgeist personifies a single chosen settlement, a zeitgeist binder can call it anywhere, but outside the bounds of its settlement, it loses the benefits of its settlement aspect and settlement avatar abilities.

Settlement Avatar			KEY:Zeitgeist Binder ~ Settlement Avatar							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Features.ZeitgeistBinderClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																									DESC:When a zeitgeist binder reaches 2nd level, the zeitgeist becomes a living avatar of the settlement. As a standard action, it can project its senses out into the settlement, perceiving the general pulse of its chosen aspect throughout the whole settlement as well as anything involving its aspect that is occurring within 50 feet per spiritualist level. The sensing works like enter image, so the zeitgeist attempts a Perception check at a -10 penalty to notice any particular activity within range. The zeitgeist can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to the zeitgeist binder's spiritualist level. These rounds need not be consecutive. When the zeitgeist binder reaches 10th level, the zeitgeist can project its senses to feel its settlement aspect at will. Additionally, the zeitgeist binder gains a bonus teamwork feat as long as she is in her zeitgeist's settlement. The zeitgeist binder must meet the teamwork feat's prerequisites, and she grants the feat as a bonus feat to her zeitgeist, even if it doesn't meet the prerequisites.

Implements and Focus Powers	KEY:Psychometrist ~ Implements and Focus Powers						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Features.PsychometristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																									DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] A psychometrist learns to use the powers of one implement school from the occultist class (Occult Adventures p47); the conjuration implement school is not available to a psychometrist. This implement school does not allow the psychometrist to cast any spells of that school of magic, though, and he can't use spell-trigger or spell-completion magic items from any schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. A psychometrist can't select an implement school more than once. The psychometrist treats his vigilante level as his occultist level for purposes of determining how his implements' focus powers work, and for determining at what level he may choose certain focus powers. Unlike an occultist, each of a psychometrist's focus powers has its own associated implement or gadget. For example, a psychometrist might own a scabbard implement to use the legacy weapon focus power and an implement that is a pair of boots to use the sudden speed focus power. The psychometrist must assign mental focus separately to each implement each day, and he doesn't gain resonant powers from his implements. Otherwise, this ability acts like the occultist's implements class feature. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the psychometrist learns to use one additional implement school. &nl;Each time a psychometrist learns an implement school, he learns the base focus power from that school, plus one focus power from each implement school he has previously learned (but not from the new school he just learned). The psychometrist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see below). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the psychometrist's vigilante level + the psychometrist's Intelligence modifier. The psychometrist can select a school he already knows, and in this case, he gains a total of two new focus powers from that school (instead of learning the base focus power from the new school).

Psychometric Strike		KEY:Psychometrist ~ Psychometric Strike							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Features.PsychometristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																									DESC:A psychometrist gains twice the usual benefits of vengeance strike (up to the same maximum) against an opponent who possesses an object that once belonged to the psychometrist. This ability alters vengeance strike.
