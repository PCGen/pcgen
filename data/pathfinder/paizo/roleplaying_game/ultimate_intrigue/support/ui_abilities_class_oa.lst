While a hallucinist's body sways oddly under the effects of his hallucinogen, it grants him strange insights that reveal things to him that others can't see.

A hallucinogen follows all the normal rules and restrictions for an alchemist's mutagen as if they were the same substance, just as a cognatogen does.

Drug Lore						KEY:Hallucinist ~ Drug Lore					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Investigator Class Features.HallucinistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														SOURCEPAGE:p.34		DESC:A hallucinist has a deep understanding and appreciation of drugs. If the hallucinist spends 1 minute physically examining a drug, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural drug or a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical drug (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC). Once he identifies a drug, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the drug. Success renders the dose harmless. The hallucinist has no chance of accidentally drugging herself when examining or attempting to neutralize a drug.

By expending 10 minutes of the duration of his hallucinogen or one use of inspiration, he can create an effect similar to minor image or oneiric horror (DC %1).|10+InvestigatorLVL/2+INT	DESC: He can also create an effect similar to synesthesia (DC %1).

Simultaneous Study				KEY:Hallucinist ~ Simultaneous Study			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Investigator Class Features.HallucinistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural														SOURCEPAGE:p.34		DESC:At 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, the expanded mind of a hallucinist is able to maintain his studied combat bonuses against an additional target at the same time. In order to do so, the hallucinist must be using his psychedelic perception ability and must expend one use of inspiration in order to designate each target beyond the first target (this cost stacks with the use of inspiration required to designate a target more than once per 24 hours). He still needs to take a move action for each target, designating them one at a time. The hallucinist can discard this connection to a target of studied combat as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place. This ability alters studied combat.

Earthmeld						KEY:Wild Talent ~ Earthmeld					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Earth Climb		PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Earth,4	SOURCEPAGE:p.66		PRETEXT:Prerequisite earth climb		DESC:Element earth; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0 - You meld a creature into stone, where it can listen to conversations without being detected. This functions as the meld into stone spell, except it can work on any willing creature, not just you, and it lasts for %1 minutes or until you use earthmeld again. The melded creature, not you, decides when to step out of the stone. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration of an earthmeld until the next time you recover burn. Such increased earthmelds don't end if you use earthmeld again, allowing you to maintain multiple earthmelds.|KineticistLVL*10
Flame Trap						KEY:Wild Talent ~ Flame Trap					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent														PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Fire,2	SOURCEPAGE:p.66									DESC:Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 2; Burn 0 - You lay a fiery trap on a container, ensuring the destruction of sensitive documents while punishing those who would steal your secrets. In order to weave the trap, you must spend 10 minutes in contact with the container you wish to trap. At the end of that time, the container is trapped until the next time you use this wild talent or until it triggers. Any creature other than you who opens the container takes damage as from your fire blast (or blue flame blast, if you have it). The damage affects the creature automatically if it is touching the container, but if it opens the container from within 30 feet, it can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage, and if it opens the container from farther still, it takes no damage. Whether or not the creature that opened the container takes damage, your kinetic blast damage also affects any items within the container that you choose, as well as the container, if you wish it, and leaves all other items undamaged. This counts as a magical trap with a Perception and Disable Device DC of %1. You can accept 1 point of burn when using flame trap to make a new trap without dismissing any previous traps. If you do, the trap lasts until the next time you recover burn.|10+KineticistLVL/2+DEX
Touchsight, Spying				KEY:Wild Talent ~ Spying Touchsight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Touchsight		PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Aether,4	SOURCEPAGE:p.66		PRETEXT:Prerequisite touchsight		DESC:Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0 - You attach a sticky strand of invisible aether to a target and then project your senses along the strand, allowing you to spy on that target. Attaching the strand of aether requires a ranged touch attack, but if you activate this ability while your target is under the effect of your touchsight, you can use the strands from your touchsight instead. Once you have activated spying touchsight, you can concentrate on it to spy on your target with any of your five senses (though your own body no longer benefits from the senses you project); the strand lasts as long you concentrate, though you can switch which senses you are projecting each round. A creature using see invisibility or a similar effect can notice the trailing strand of aether and follow it back to you. A creature can break your spying touchsight by dispelling it, but otherwise, the only way to break the strand is if one of you uses a teleportation effect, moves more than 1 mile from the other, or is completely blocked from the other in all directions (such as if one of you were inside a telekinetic sphere).
Voice of the Wind, Greater			KEY:Wild Talent ~ Voice of the Wind (Greater)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Voice Of The Wind	PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Air,2	SOURCEPAGE:p.66		PRETEXT:Prerequisite voice of the wind	DESC:Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 2; Burn 0 - Your voice of the wind ability gains both power and finesse. You can use voice of the wind to create unusual sounds, as ghost sound, to throw your voice, as ventriloquism, and even to alter your voice, as vocal alteration. You can send messages at a much greater distance than before and at a faster rate. When using voice of the wind's whispering wind effect, you can choose to have the wind rise high into the sky, where it can gust at 50 miles per hour before descending to deliver the message. While the gust is still small, abnormal wind that fast is noticeable, unlike the normal gentle zephyr from whispering wind. If you choose to use the faster gust, you can deliver a message as far as %1 miles, instead of %2 miles.|KineticistLVL*50|KineticistLVL
Watersense, Greater				KEY:Wild Talent ~ Watersense (Greater)			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wild Talent.Utility Wild Talent		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Talent ~ Watersense		PREVARGTEQ:KineticistLVL_Water,5	SOURCEPAGE:p.66		PRETEXT:Prerequisite watersense		DESC:Element water; Type utility (Su); Level 5; Burn 0 - You project your watersense outward through the tides and water around you, allowing you to spy on others at a distance. You can take 10 minutes to project your senses, choosing a location within 480 feet that is connected to your current location via the same continuous body of water, or you can take 1 hour to attempt to spy on a specific creature within %1 miles that is visible from a location connected to your current location via the same continuous body of water. In the latter case, the creature receives a Will save as per scrying (including bonuses and penalties based on connection and knowledge); a target that saves is immune to your greater watersense for 24 hours. In either case, an extremely thin funnel of water, lasting for %1 minutes, carries light and sound to your location, where your target area or location appears in the water next to you and you can view it as if through a scrying sensor, allowing you to both see and hear the area immediately surrounding the other end of the funnel. In the case of a distance greater than 480 feet, the sound comes 1 round later than its corresponding visual information for every mile away you are (for instance, if you were 5 miles away, you would see your target start talking 5 rounds before you heard what it said). When you are tracking a creature, the funnel moves as best it can through the water to follow that creature, up to 150 feet per round, but the target can escape by simply moving away from the water. If you also possess the voice of the wind wild talent, you can use its message effect to send your voice through the funnel with a delay of 1 round per mile. This wild talent is a divination and scrying effect.|KineticistLVL

This ability functions as the touch treatment ability, but can only be used to remove harmful conditions from the enigma, not other creatures. In order to remove these harmful effects, the enigma must succeed at a touch attack against another creature. The creature touched gains the chosen harmful effect for whatever duration it would have afflicted the enigma and the effect is removed from the enigma, unless the creature succeeds at a Will save (DC %1). Using this ability is always a standard action.|10+MesmeristLVL/2+CHA	DESC: The enigma can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of bestow curse, delivered as a touch attack as part of using this ability.|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=14	DESC: Transfer affliction is a mind-affecting effect.

#Eyebiter
Eyeball Familiar					KEY:Eyebiter ~ Eyeball Familiar				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.EyebiterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.36		DESC:An eyebiter imbues one of his eyes with limited sentience, so that he can pluck it out and allow it to move on its own. The eyeball familiar functions similarly to the tumor familiar alchemist discovery (Ultimate Magic) except as follows. The eyeball familiar does not have fast healing. The eyeball familiar doesn't resemble an animal, and its size is Fine for a Medium or smaller eyebiter (or one size category larger for every size category the eyebiter is larger than Medium). It has a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability) and no physical attacks (though it can still deliver touch spells once the eyebiter has reached 3rd level). The eyeball has a Strength score of 1, a Dexterity score of 12, and Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10. It has no set Hit Die, base saves, or skill ranks of its own, though it uses its master's when a familiar normally would. It doesn't grant its master any familiar bonus, nor can it ever be an improved familiar. Whenever the eyebiter's eyeball familiar leaves his body, he is dazzled until it returns (if it is destroyed, the eyebiter loses that eye until he gains the effects of a regeneration). An eyebiter must have at least one eye to use this ability, and an eyebiter with only one eye is blinded instead of dazzled until his familiar returns.

He can use this ability as a standard action %1 times per day. A successful Will save negates the effect (DC %2); this is a mind-affecting ability.

Nature's Lure					KEY:Fey Trickster ~ Nature's Lure				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.FeyTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																	SOURCEPAGE:p.37		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Rather than casting psychic spells from the mesmerist spell list, a fey trickster casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists, in just the same way as a hunter does. This means that she gains orisons instead of knacks. This doesn't change her number of spells per day or spells known. The fey trickster's mesmerist spells and spell-like abilities count as if they were fey spell-like abilities for the purpose of effects like resist nature's lure that apply against fey spell-like abilities. This alters the mesmerist's spellcasting.
Feytouched						KEY:Fey Trickster ~ Feytouched				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.FeyTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														SOURCEPAGE:p.37		DESC:A fey trickster's time with the fey has granted her strange powers, as well as resistance to further fey mischief. The fey trickster gains the druid's resist nature's lure and woodland stride abilities, and she counts as both fey and her original creature type for the purpose of spells and effects.
Fey Veil						KEY:Fey Trickster ~ Fey Veil					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.FeyTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.SpellLike													SOURCEPAGE:p.37		DESC:A fey trickster's physical form begins to shift, as she gains some of the impossible allure of the fey. At the same time, she begins able to use fey veils to assist herself and her allies in befuddling and bewitching their opponents. She can use her fey veils %1 times per day. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. At 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute.|3+CHA	DESC: At 6th level, she can change the ally's form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self, but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn't allow a saving throw to disbelieve).|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=6	DESC: At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projection.|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=10	DESC: At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour. Each of these abilities, even the 14th-level ability, is an illusion and glamer effect, though the last ability counts as a size-changing polymorph effect for the limit of only one polymorph or size-changing effect on a creature.|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=14
One with the Fey					KEY:Fey Trickster ~ One with the Fey			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.FeyTricksterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																	SOURCEPAGE:p.38		DESC:A fey trickster fully transforms into a fey, though she can still choose to count as her original creature type as well whenever it would be advantageous to her (such as if she is a humanoid and wishes to be affected by reduce person). She gains low-light vision as well as an additional ability depending on which type of fey she chooses to most closely associate with. Some examples follow. [Erlking] The fey trickster is constantly under the effects of haste. [Nymph] The fey trickster gains the nymph's unearthly grace ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 217) [Quickling] The fey trickster gains the quickling's supernatural speed ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 227). [Rusalka] The fey trickster gains the rusalka's tresses ability and four tress primary natural attacks similar to those of a rusalka (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 232).

#Thought Eater
Assume Identity					KEY:Thought Eater ~ Assume Identity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.ThoughtEaterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															SOURCEPAGE:p.38		DESC:When a thought eater targets a creature with his hypnotic stare ability, the thought eater gains a bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature. This bonus is equal to the thought eater's mesmerist level, and lasts for 24 hours, or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.
Assume Morality					KEY:Thought Eater ~ Assume Morality				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.ThoughtEaterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															SOURCEPAGE:p.38		DESC:The thought eater's alignment matches that of the target of his assume identity ability for the purposes of spells and effects that discern alignment. This includes any increase to alignment aura strength from class features, such as a cleric's aura ability.
Assume Knowledge					KEY:Thought Eater ~ Assume Knowledge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.ThoughtEaterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															SOURCEPAGE:p.38		DESC:The thought eater can choose one Knowledge skill possessed by the target of his hypnotic stare. He uses the target's number of ranks in that skill, instead of his own, to calculate his bonus (but not for other purposes, such as meeting the prerequisites of feats) to a maximum number of ranks equal to his mesmerist level. This ability lasts for 24 hours or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.
Consume Identity					KEY:Thought Eater ~ Consume Identity			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.ThoughtEaterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															SOURCEPAGE:p.38		DESC:When the thought eater kills a target of his hypnotic stare, he can choose to entirely consume the creature's identity, mind, body, and soul as a free action. The target's corpse dissolves and as long as the thought eater lives, the target of consume identity cannot be brought back from the dead until the thought eater releases the identity (a standard action) or uses consume identity on another target. The creature's soul can also be released by a wish or miracle (which ends the effect of consume identity). When the thought eater has consumed an identity, all divination spells identify him as (and consider him to be) the creature whose identity he consumed rather than himself. This ability fools any spell short of discern location. Discern location pinpoints the thought eater's location, whenever either the thought eater or the consumed creature is the target of that spell.

#Vizier
Insidious Influence				KEY:Vizier ~ Insidious Influence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.VizierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.38		DESC:A vizier subtly influences his allies and others who trust him, making it more likely they will follow his suggestions. Allies with mesmerist tricks implanted by the vizier take penalties on Will saves made to resist the vizier's abilities and spells, and on Diplomacy, Intimidate, Sense Motive checks attempted against the vizier. This penalty equals that imposed by the vizier's hypnotic stare. If the vizier uses his hypnotic stare against such an ally, these penalties stack.	DESC: The vizier automatically gains the susceptibility bold stare improvement, and it also applies to the DCs of any influence check (see Ultimate Intrigue page 102) to manipulate the target (even if it isn't Diplomacy or Intimidate).|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=3		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Bold Stare ~ Susceptibility|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=3
Power Behind the Throne				KEY:Vizier ~ Power Behind the Throne			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.VizierClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.38		DESC:The vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn't contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier's spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers' memories and perception of the spell's casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier's allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC %1) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell's casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally's implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own.|10+MesmeristLVL/2+CHA	DESC: The vizier doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calm spell. A creature that disbelieves this second effect becomes immune to that vizier's illusion of calm for 24 hours.|PRECLASS:1,Mesmerist=5

#Vox

Unlike most psychic spells, a vox's mesmerist spells use both thought and verbal components; like a bard, a vox cannot remove the verbal components of his spells. This alters the mesmerist's spellcasting.

Compelling Voice					KEY:Vox ~ Compelling Voice					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.VoxClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.39		DESC:A vox can focus the sound of his voice on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, sapping that target's willpower and rendering her more vulnerable to mind-affecting powers, rather than using a stare like other mesmerists. A vox can use his compelling voice even while deafened, but it has a 20%% chance to fail, just like casting a spell with a verbal component. The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox's voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox's compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist's hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.
Wounding Words					KEY:Vox ~ Wounding Words					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.VoxClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.39		DESC:A vox can focus the power of his voice to magnify the force of his blows in melee. As a standard action, a vox can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6+%1 points of sonic damage. Alternatively, he can make a single attack with a melee weapon as a standard action, adding the listed sonic damage to the damage dealt by his weapon on a successful attack. He can use this ability %2 times per day. If the target of the vox's wounding words is also the target of his compelling voice, that creature must succeed at a Will save (DC %3) or take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round. This penalty doesn't stack with the effects of the Concussive Spell metamagic feat.|MesmeristLVL|3+CHA|10+MesmeristLVL/2+CHA
Subsonic Strike					KEY:Vox ~ Subsonic Strike					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Mesmerist Class Features.VoxClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.39		DESC:A vox is able to unleash a deadly flurry of his wounding words as a standard action. He can target %1 creatures or objects within 30 feet, requiring a ranged touch attack against each target. If the target of his compelling voice is within 30 feet, he can choose to instead target only that creature with a single ranged touch or melee touch attack, dealing double normal damage on a successful attack. Whatever choice he makes, the vox must expend one use of wounding words.|max(1,CHA)

Emotional Reading					KEY:Ancestral Aspirant ~ Emotional Reading		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Features.AncestralAspirantClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																SOURCEPAGE:p.68		DESC:An ancestral aspirant doesn’t care much about objects that didn’t belong to his ancestors, but he is keenly attuned to his relatives and fellow nobles, allowing him to read the emotions of others. If he spends 1 minute examining a creature, he learns one fact, chosen by the GM, about the creature’s current emotions. Since emotional auras are complex, this ability is unlikely to reveal the secret feelings of a professional spy; instead, it only touches upon surface emotions.

This works similarly to outside contact except for the following differences; First, he doesn’t need to use a magic circle or make a payment (though he still expends 1 point of mental focus from his enchantment implement). Second, he can use those contacts to gather information for him (as per the Diplomacy skill to gather information) without spending the time himself, rather than asking a question and receiving a result similar to a divination. He can ask more questions over the same time period as normal with outside contact, for a total of %1 questions that are in some way related to one another.|(OccultistLVL-4)/4	DESC: Instead of delivering messages and objects, the courtly contacts can spread vicious rumors and gossip about a target throughout a settlement, causing any creatures in the settlement whose attitude toward the target wasn’t helpful to have its attitude toward the target worsened by one step.

She gains new implements as normal at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, and they can be of any school. A secret broker’s third eye resonant power grants an insight bonus on Profession and Sense Motive checks equal to the bonus it grants on Perception checks, and an insight bonus on all Knowledge checks equal to half that bonus. She must select divination with implement mastery. This ability alters implements and implement mastery.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Occultist Implement School ~ Divination
Broker Secrets					KEY:Secret Broker ~ Broker Secrets				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Features.SecretBrokerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															SOURCEPAGE:p.68		DESC:A secret broker can trade her secrets to another. For the purpose of this ability, an object’s secret is composed of pieces of information gained from a single object through object reading, object seer, psychometry, or read object that the occultist didn’t otherwise know and hasn’t shared with another, written somewhere, or otherwise recorded or found a way to recover should she forget them and lose possession of the object. The secret broker can willingly use this ability in tandem with handing the object over to another creature in order to transfer the object’s secret to that creature. The secret broker forgets the object’s secret and the creature instantly learns the object’s secret. The secret broker can also destroy an object to remove his memory of the object’s secret without transferring it to another. In either case, any onlookers who understand what the secret broker is doing, and the recipient in the case of a transfer, can intrinsically tell that the secret broker has used this ability rather than simply sharing the memory through other means or destroying the object but keeping its secret.
Share Memory					KEY:Secret Broker ~ Share Memory				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Features.SecretBrokerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike															SOURCEPAGE:p.68		DESC:A secret broker learns to use her knowledge transference powers more flexibly, allowing her to use share memory at will, but only with willing targets.

This works as her share memory ability, except it allows her to access memories from unwilling targets. A target that succeeds at its saving throw against a secret broker’s steal secret ability is forever after immune to that secret broker’s steal secret ability. While this ability replaces magic circles, the secret broker can still use outside contact, though she leverages the outsider's secrets rather than create a circle.

This works similarly to modify memory to erase the memory of an event, except the effect is instantaneous and leaves no magical trace (it can still be removed by break enchantment, psychic surgery, limited wish, miracle, or wish) and the secret broker can remove only one fact, such as “The queen and the general are having an affair” rather than a 5-minute event. Erasing the memory of a fact does not prevent the target from learning the fact again, or even potentially from deducing the fact again from evidence, given time.

This will be reflected in the next errata.
