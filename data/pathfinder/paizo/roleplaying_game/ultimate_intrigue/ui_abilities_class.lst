Dual Identity				KEY:Vigilante ~ Dual Identity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante's true identity revealed to the world at large. The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante's secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user's appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret. Despite being a single person, a vigilante's dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity's alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante's two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.

Startling Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Startling Appearance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:A vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante's presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante's turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a -4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante's next turn.

Frightening Appearance			KEY:Vigilante ~ Frightening Appearance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence, the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante's attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC %1). Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante's frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability.

If the creature has more than %2 HD, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante's stunning appearance for 24 hours.

Vengeance Strike				KEY:Vigilante ~ Vengeance Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:A vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante's presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made.	DESC:He automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike.|PREVAREQ:VigilanteIsAvenger,1,VigilanteIsMountedFury,0	DESC:If the vigilante would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.|PREVAREQ:VigilanteIsStalker,1																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.17

A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage is reduced to %1d4. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).

If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location's layout (such as a Stealth check to sneak into the location, a Disable Device check to disable an alarm, or a Sleight of Hand check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll.

In order to complete his day's work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the Craft or Profession skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he's chosen with social grace.

This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally).

Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal.

Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a full-round action. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a Disguise check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person.

While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person's initial attitude would have at least been indifferent. While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within %1 miles. A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that's one category worse, rather than one category better.|VigilanteTalentLVL												BONUS:SITUATION|Intimidate=In Vigilante Identity|4|TYPE=Circumstance.STACK																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.12

This special bomb remains inert until 1 round after it leaves the alchemical sapper's possession, after which time it becomes armed. When a creature enters a square containing an armed trip mine, it explodes, dealing normal bomb damage to all creatures in its square (DC %1; Reflex half) and splash damage to every creature adjacent to that square. A trip mine can be disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (DC %1); otherwise, it lasts until the next time the alchemical sapper refreshes his daily bombs. If the alchemical sapper expends four uses of his bomb class feature, his trip mine deals damage as per a demolition bomb; this does not count against his daily uses of the demolition bomb ability.

Injections										KEY:Interrogator ~ Injections													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.AlchemicalSapperClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:An interrogator uses his skill with alchemy to create injections. Each day, an interrogator can create %1 injections. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the interrogator attempts to use it. Using an injection is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a -2 penalty on its Will saving throws for %2 minutes. If the interrogator is also using a serum with this injection, the penalty on Will saves applies to any save against the serum. If the melee touch attack fails, the injection isn't delivered but can still be used again-once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn't been administered becomes inert if it leaves the interrogator's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his possession. The penalties from multiple injections don't stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from a mesmerist's stare or a witch's evil eye hex.

An interrogator prepares his serums at the same time as his injections and he can apply them to any injection as a swift action before he makes the attack roll for the injection. An interrogator knows one serum at 1st level and can learn another serum in place of a discovery. The save DCs of serums are %1. A creature can be under the effect of only a single serum at a time-with the exception of memory modification serum-with any further serums on the same creature replacing the old serum. Unless otherwise noted, a creature that succeeds on its saving throw against a serum is immune to that serum's effects for 24 hours.

This does not mean the tyrant can't take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ambitions. A tyrant's code requires that he place his own sinister goals above all else, respect rightful authority even as he twists its loopholes to his own ends, impose tyranny, and punish all those who dare dissent. A tyrant can accept underlings of any alignment; he cares not who serves him, only that they are truly loyal to him. He can even work alongside good-aligned individuals, as long as he is secretly manipulating them. This alters the antipaladin's code of conduct and associated abilities, as well as the section on ex-antipaladins.

The ringleader must explain his plan to that ally for a number of minutes equal to the number of bardic performance rounds he expends on the effect, and use audible and/or visual components according to the performance altered. This costs the ringleader the chosen number of rounds of bardic performance. At any time before the ringleader recovers bardic performance rounds for the day, the inspired character can activate the performance as a standard action wherever she is. When activated, the altered performance affects only the inspired ally and has no audible or visible components. If the performance could normally affect any number of allies, its effects last 2 rounds for each round the ringleader spent on the performance. Otherwise, the effects last 1 round for each round the ringleader spent on the performance. A ringleader can alter only the countersong, distraction, inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics performances in this way. The ringleader makes any necessary choices when establishing the performance, though in the case of countersong and distraction, the ringleader attempts Perform checks once his ally triggers the plan, ignoring any temporary bonuses or penalties, no matter whether they applied when he explained the plan or when the ally triggers it. A character can be subject to only one inspired plan at a time and cannot be subject to a ringleader's inspired plan and any of the ringleader's normal performances at the same time, but she can benefit from other bardic performances in the interim. The ringleader cannot use inspired plan on himself, but he can have dormant plans ready to trigger on as many different allies as he can afford to affect at once.

At 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels, a feyspeaker adds one enchantment or illusion spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her druid spell list as a spell of 1 level higher (for instance, at 4th level, she could add color spray as a 2nd-level druid spell). In order to select a spell, she must be of a level high enough (including the increased spell level) to cast it. Once selected, the spell cannot be changed. A feyspeaker loses the ability to spontaneously cast summon nature's ally spells. She gains the wild shape ability at 6th level and gains all benefits related to wild shape 2 druid levels later than usual.

This ability functions just like a Bluff check to deceive a character. To determine the result of the wild mischief check, the feyspeaker rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier. As with Bluff checks, wild mischief checks are modified depending on the believability of the false information. A typical domestic animal is not particularly suspicious of the feyspeaker (no circumstance modifier), whereas wild animals are usually suspicious (-5 penalty on the check). To use wild mischief, the feyspeaker and the animal must be able to study each other, which means they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as when influencing people, it could take more or less time. A feyspeaker can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

A cipher removes Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform from his list of class skills, and he can never use them with inspiration, regardless of any talents or other abilities he might have. A cipher can use his inspiration on any Disguise, Escape Artist, Knowledge (local), Sleight of Hand, and Stealth check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, instead of the normal investigator ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspiration.

Inattention Blindness								KEY:Cipher ~ Inattention Blindness												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Investigator Class Features.CipherClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:A cipher can blind nearby creatures to his presence. A creature who would become aware of a cipher's presence when the cipher is within %1 feet must succeed at a Perception check against a DC %2 or the creature ignores the investigator as though it had not become aware of his presence. The cipher can spend a use of inspiration to raise the DC by 1d6. The affected creature continues to ignore the cipher until he attacks, moves out of range, directly interacts with the creature, interacts with another creature or object in a way the affected creature notices, or otherwise specifically draws attention to himself. If the cipher does none of these things, the affected creature can attempt another Perception check at the same DC for each minute the cipher remains in range. A creature that was aware of the cipher's presence prior to being in range of his inattention blinding ability is unaffected. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A cipher can affect only %3 creature with inattention blindness at any given time. Once a cipher reaches that maximum, he can't affect an additional creature until he ends the effect for an already affected creature. If multiple creatures enter the range of inattention blindness simultaneously, they all must attempt Perception checks; the inattention blindness effect affects the creatures with the lowest Perception check results, in order, until it reaches the maximum number of creatures it can affect. The cipher can suppress or activate inattention blindness as a free action, and dismiss its effects on any affected creature within range as a move action.|InvestigatorLVL*10|10+InvestigatorLVL+INT|1+((InvestigatorLVL-2)/3)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.32

This allows the forensic physician to identify the race of creature that spilled the blood, and the creature's age and gender (if any). If the forensic physician succeeds at the Heal check but might not have heard of the creature's race before, he can attempt an automatic Knowledge check to see if he knows about the creature. If he succeeds, he identifies the blood (and gains all other benefits of the Knowledge check); otherwise, he knows that he succeeded at the Heal check but the blood is not from a creature he recognizes. If the blood is in its original setting, and the forensic physician exceeds the DC by 5 or more, he can study the blood to determine a rough estimate of when the blood was shed, and he can study the bloodstain patterns to get an approximate idea of how the creatures involved were positioned and moving.

She gains her first use of smite evil at 2nd level, instead of 1st, though she still gains further uses of smite evil at the rate listed on Table 3-11 of the Core Rulebook. She never gains the aura of good or divine grace class features. Her aura of courage does not make her immune to fear, her aura of resolve does not make her immune to charms, and her aura of righteousness does not make her immune to compulsions.

She should strive to act with honor and uphold the tenets of her faith, but failing to do so is not a violation of her code, and other than evil actions, she can do whatever else she feels is necessary to uphold the causes of law and good. This ability replaces the paladin's code of conduct and associated abilities and alters the section on ex-paladins.

The gray paladin must truly believe that the creature she smites is an opponent to the cause of good. Even if this nonevil foe is an outsider, undead, or dragon, she doesn't add increased damage to her first attack.

She and her allies within 10 feet gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against divination effects. Furthermore, casters of divinations that target the gray paladin or her nearby allies must succeed at a caster level check as though the gray paladin and her nearby allies were under the effect of a nondetection spell cast by the gray paladin, with a caster level equal to the gray paladin's paladin level. This ability functions while the gray paladin is conscious and while she is sleeping, but not if she is unconscious for any other reason, or dead.

He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against courtiers, officials, nobles, and gentry from that nation. Likewise, he gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A dandy can attempt the appropriate Knowledge checks untrained to identify such people from the selected country. A dandy gains additional favored nations, and can increase the bonuses of one of his current favored nations, in the same way he would with a normal ranger's favored enemy.

Rumor Empathy									KEY:Dandy ~ Rumor Empathy													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.DandyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:A dandy can alter the flow and spread of rumors in his favor. This functions similarly to wild empathy, except that it takes 1 day (8 hours of work), instead of 1 minute, and it affects the general tenor of a rumor instead of a wild animal. A successful rumor empathy check allows the dandy to increase or decrease the rumor's tone by one step. For example, he could make an indifferent rumor friendly and thus positive toward its target, or an unfriendly rumor hostile and thus even more negative toward its target than it was originally. The difficulty of influencing a rumor depends on the size of the community in which it is spreading. The DC of the check is 15 in a village or smaller settlement. This DC increases by 5 and the number of days required to attempt the check increases by 2 for every settlement size category larger than a village-to a maximum of DC 40 and 11 days to affect a rumor spreading through an entire metropolis. If the rumor is only spreading through a smaller segment of the population, such as the elven district in a larger metropolis, use the population of that smaller segment to determine the DC and number of days of work required to use rumor empathy. The DC also increases by 10 if the rumor is about the dandy himself, since the dandy is obviously a biased source with respects to rumors about his own person.

If he succeeds, he finds himself an invitation, an invitee looking for a date, a staff member willing to look the other way, or some other way to enter the party.

The guildbreaker's bonuses from favored enemy apply against official members of this organization regardless of their creature type, but not against the organization's allies, paid mercenaries, or forced labor.

As a result, he gains an innate sense of comings and goings in the hustle around him. When in an urban environment, a guildbreaker can use the Survival skill to gather information, but only about the movements of creatures and what sort of people (races, social classes, predominant professions, and the like) occupy the community. Unlike with the normal way to gather information, the guildbreaker studies the signs of the city instead of asking around, so it doesn't spread word about the nature of his questions to others.

A guildbreaker adds a circumstance bonus equal to twice his favored organization bonus to all Bluff and Disguise checks to appear to be a member of the organization (this does not apply on Disguise checks to change his appearance and replace a specific member, but rather to checks related to appear to be a general member of the organization). The bonus on Bluff checks from deep cover stacks with the guildbreaker's overall bonus from favored organization if the person he is attempting to deceive is also a member of that organization. A guildbreaker posing as a member of one of his favored enemy organizations automatically defeats truth-telling magic (as if under the effects of glibness), but only for the purpose of claiming to be a member of the organization. Truth-telling magic can still expose him with a more indirect question, such as a member of a non-religious evil organization asking the guildbreaker for the identity of his patron deity.

At any time, she can spend 1 minute setting up this ability. Once she has done so, she must stand still, taking no other actions except to keep track of her surroundings; she can't even take free actions like talking. Her heightened senses grant her a supernatural awareness of her surroundings within %1 feet. If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends, she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination effect and can't be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme effects like mind blank). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under invisibility, silence, and negate aroma all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder's location, ignoring any Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities. This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single spot. The sentinel can use this ability for 1 hour without penalty. Using sense intruder for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage to the sentinel, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour. A sentinel who takes any nonlethal damage from using this ability becomes fatigued. Each hour the sentinel uses sense intruder also counts as 1 hour of hustling overland for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage the sentinel takes in a single day. Starting at 10th level, whenever the sentinel gains a combat style feat, she can choose to trade it for a 10-foot increase in the radius of this ability.

The transporter's shelter can hold the transporter and one additional creature for every 2 by which the transporter exceeds the DC. The created shelter incorporates scents from the local area, preventing creatures on the inside from being detected by the scent ability of creatures outside of the shelter, and vice versa. Additionally, its floor is either elevated or constructed of a different substance than the nearby ground, preventing creatures outside of the shelter from using tremorsense to detect creatures inside, and vice versa. Finally, the clever structure of the hideaway causes creatures outside of the shelter to take a -10 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures inside, as if through a 1-foot-thick wall, while only causing creatures inside to take a -2 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures outside. These bonuses do not apply if the enemy creatures are intimately familiar with the area in which the hideaway was built (such as an area right near their home).

# Rogue Talents
# ==============================
###These talents use RogueLVL rather than RogueTalentLVL because they are to be restrictred to ONLY rogues. While they are intended for Unchained rogues, it is suggested to allow them for all rogues.
Follow Along									KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Follow Along												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RogueTalent																																																																																																																																																																																																															PREVARGTEQ:RogueLVL,1																																																																																																		DESC:A rogue with this talent is familiar enough with enchantment magic to fool it, using spellcasters' complacency to set them up for a surprise attack. Whenever she succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment effect, the rogue learns the spell's effect on a failed save, allowing her to play along and pretend to have failed her save. If she does so, the spellcaster does not learn that she succeeded at her saving throw, even if she was the only target, though she must succeed at an opposed Bluff check against a spellcaster's Sense Motive check to determine whether she is under the enchantment's effects. While this ruse is in place, the spellcaster is flat-footed against the rogue's first attack. If the spellcaster sees the rogue perform (or fail to perform) an action that would be impossible if she were under the enchantment's effect, he automatically discovers her ruse.

This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts.

This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within %1 miles. A phantom thief can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the phantom thief. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that's one category worse, rather than one category better.|VigilanteTalentLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Like rage powers she selects in this way, the battle scion can grant this feat to allies under the effect of inspired rage, as long as those allies also meet the prerequisites, but she must expend 2 rounds of raging song for each round in which she grants a combat feat or teamwork feat. If the battle scion gains multiple feats from battle prowess, allies can use these feats to meet the prerequisites for other feats while they're affected by battle prowess (for example, a battle scion with Power Attack and Cleave from battle prowess could grant both, allowing allies with a +1 base attack bonus and a Strength score of 13 to gain both, since they can use Power Attack to qualify for Cleave).

The battle scion can offer a reward for the completion of the noble quest, but if she does so and fails to live up to her agreement, she becomes an ex-battle scion and loses all benefits gained from the archetype (she does not gain the abilities they replaced, either).

While in his vigilante identity, a brute becomes one size category larger, gaining no ability score adjustments but otherwise gaining all adjustments for his new size, including additional reach, if appropriate. A brute's vigilante identity is savage and dangerous. While in his vigilante identity, the brute takes a -2 penalty to AC, as well as to all ability checks and skill checks that rely on Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence. Furthermore, the brute cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). &nl;When a brute is in mortal peril, such as when combat starts, if he is in his social identity, he must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) or enter his vigilante identity. Entering his vigilante identity in this way is a horrifying and painful process that takes 1 full round, during which he is flat-footed, and it typically allows his enemies to see his transformation and learn his identity. The brute's vigilante identity can't always tell friend from foe. While he still attacks enemies preferentially during a battle, when there are no more enemies around, each round he must succeed at a Will save (DC %2) or continue fighting against his allies or bystanders. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy, as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, he slowly turns back to his social identity over the course of 1 minute (or shorter if he has a social talent that reduces that time). &nl;A brute uses his vigilante level as his base attack bonus, but only while he is in his vigilante identity.|10+VigilanteLVL/2|20+VigilanteLVL/2	DESC:While in his vigilante identity, the brute gains a +%1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls.

Magical clothes and accessories increase in size with the vigilante, however (though his magical armor and weapons initially do not, as normal). &nl;A brute can stay in his vigilante identity for up to 2 hours at a time, for a total of up to 6 hours in a 24-hour period. When threatened in his vigilante identity, he has the potential to damage bystanders or allies. After switching from his vigilante identity to his social identity, he is fatigued for the same amount of time (rounds, minutes, or hours) that he spent in his vigilante identity and cannot remove or ignore this fatigue by any means except by waiting the appropriate amount of time. If he enters his vigilante identity while fatigued, once he switches back to his social identity, he becomes exhausted for the amount of time he just spent in his vigilante identity, and he also can't remove or ignore the exhaustion by any means other than waiting the appropriate length of time. A character with immunity to fatigue or exhaustion cannot adopt a brute form at all; that immunity prevents the transformation as an effect that would cause fatigue or exhaustion. &nl;An exhausted brute can only enter his vigilante identity for %1 rounds; following these rounds, the brute immediately falls unconscious, or into a stupor if he is somehow prevented from falling unconscious. In this state, a brute can be healed as normal (and, if he has 0 hit points or more, he returns to consciousness after receiving any amount of magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check), but he cannot enter his vigilante identity for 1 hour.|max(1,VigilanteLVL/2)																																ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Temp Bonus ~ Brute Form|PREVAREQ:ActivateBruteForm,1																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												BONUS:VAR|VigilanteIsBrute|1	BONUS:VAR|BruteMeleeBonus|1+(VigilanteLVL>=13)+(VigilanteLVL>=19)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.53																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								TEMPBONUS:PC|VAR|ActivateBruteForm|1

A melee mystic bolt requires the target to be within reach, and a ranged mystic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A mystic bolt deals %1d6 points of damage. The warlock must choose one type of damage for her mystic bolt: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Attacking with a mystic bolt takes the place of one of the warlock's normal attacks, and she can make a full attack using mystic bolts. The warlock vigilante attacks with mystic bolts as though they were light one-handed weapons, and the bolts can be used for two-weapon fighting (with each hand creating one mystic bolt) and feats and abilities that apply to weapon attacks (unless they're excluded from that feat, such as with Power Attack). Weapon Focus (ray) doesn't apply to mystic bolts, but a warlock can take Weapon Focus (mystic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged mystic bolts. Creating a mystic bolt requires the hand to be free, but the bolt appears only briefly, so a warlock using mystic bolts has a free hand any time she isn't attacking with a mystic bolt. The warlock threatens with a mystic bolt, but only if she has a hand free. Because mystic bolts are impermanent, a spell that targets a single weapon (like magic weapon) can't affect it, nor can a mystic bolt be made with magic weapon special abilities. Abilities that affect all weapon attacks the warlock makes, such as the arcane striker warlock talent, function with mystic bolts. At 7th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the warlock chooses another damage type from the list above.
