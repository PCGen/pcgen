Dual Identity					KEY:Vigilante ~ Dual Identity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante's true identity revealed to the world at large. The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante's secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user's appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret. Despite being a single person, a vigilante's dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity's alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante's two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.
Seamless Guise					KEY:Vigilante ~ Seamless Guise				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:SeamlessGuiseBonus|0						SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +%1 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.|SeamlessGuiseBonus		BONUS:VAR|SeamlessGuiseBonus|20
Social Talent					KEY:Vigilante ~ Social Talent					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:SocialTalentCount|0	DEFINE:VigilanteTalentLVL|0	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.

Vigilante Specialization			KEY:Vigilante ~ Vigilante Specialization			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:VigilanteIsAvenger|0						SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:A vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker. Once this choice is made, it can't be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization.		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Vigilante Specialization|1

Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can't be changed. If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +%1 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same.|SeamlessGuiseBonus	BONUS:VAR|VigilanteTalentCount|VigilanteLVL/2		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Vigilante Talent|VigilanteTalentCount	BONUS:VAR|VigilanteTalentDC|10+VigilanteLVL/2+CHA

Startling Appearance				KEY:Vigilante ~ Startling Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:A vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante's presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante's turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a -4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante's next turn.
Frightening Appearance				KEY:Vigilante ~ Frightening Appearance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence, the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante's attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC %1). Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante's frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+VigilanteLVL/2+CHA
Stunning Appearance				KEY:Vigilante ~ Stunning Appearance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:A vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence, the foe must make a successful Will save (DC %1) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante's next turn. If the creature has more than %2 HD, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante's stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|10+VigilanteLVL/2+CHA|VigilanteLVL
Vengeance Strike					KEY:Vigilante ~ Vengeance Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:A vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante's presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. 	DESC:He automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike.|PREVAREQ:VigilanteIsAvenger,1	DESC:If the vigilante would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.|PREVAREQ:VigilanteIsAvenger,0

###Block: Vigilante Specializations
Avenger						KEY:Vigilante Specialization ~ Avenger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VigilanteSpecialization.SpecialQuality													SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:An avenger has a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.	BONUS:VAR|VigilanteIsAvenger|1
Stalker						KEY:Vigilante Specialization ~ Stalker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VigilanteSpecialization.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:HiddenStrikeDiceCount|0					SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra %1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage is reduced to %1d4. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment). A stalker can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante's presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.|HiddenStrikeDiceCount		BONUS:VAR|HiddenStrikeDiceCount|(VigilanteLVL+1)/2		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|%1d8 (or %1d4)|HiddenStrikeDiceCount

Any Guise						KEY:Social Talent ~ Any Guise					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,17		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Everyman								!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Any Guise			SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:A vigilante can use his everyman social talent to disguise himself as any specific person, even a king or high priest. Furthermore, if the actual individual wouldn't normally be able to be found via magic (such as by being dead or protected from divinations designed to locate the individual), such divinations always find the vigilante instead.
Case the Joint					KEY:Social Talent ~ Case The Joint				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Case The Joint		SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:The vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location's layout (such as a Stealth check to sneak into the location, a Disable Device check to disable an alarm, or a Sleight of Hand check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll. If the vigilante fails to return to the location within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the rerolls. A vigilante can't case the same joint more than once a week.
Celebrity Discount				KEY:Social Talent ~ Celebrity Discount			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,3		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Celebrity Discount	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:The vigilante's social identity is popular enough to receive discounts in his area of renown. Whenever he buys an item in his area of renown that costs 500 gp or less, he can buy it at 90%% of the market price, rather than the full price.|CelebrityDiscountValue	DEFINE:CelebrityDiscountValue|0	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityDiscountValue|500	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityDiscountValue|1500|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityDiscountValue|6000|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown

While within his area of renown, he can always receive common meals or lodging (worth up to %1 gp per meal or night) for free, and can avoid paying taxes or bribes of %1 gp or less. If he wants a particular nonmagical item worth %2 gp or less, he can spend 1d10 minutes interacting with people in his area of renown to receive the item from a fan (if he ever sells such a gift from a fan, he loses this social talent permanently).|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|CelebrityPerksGifts	DEFINE:CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|0	DEFINE:CelebrityPerksGifts|0	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|1	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksGifts|1	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|9|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksGifts|4|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksMealsBribes|90|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown	BONUS:VAR|CelebrityPerksGifts|20|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown
Double Time						KEY:Social Talent ~ Double Time				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Double Time		SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante's social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day's work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the Craft or Profession skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he's chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.
Everyman						KEY:Social Talent ~ Everyman					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,11		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Many Guises								!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Everyman			SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise using his many guises social talent. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50%% chance of finding the vigilante instead of the actual individual, and divination spells and abilities used on the vigilante give results as if he were the actual individual. Although this doesn't grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante's training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to properly play the part of the individual.
Feign Innocence					KEY:Social Talent ~ Feign Innocence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Feign Innocence		SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante's social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this provides a nonmagical effect identical to the innocence spell (Advanced Player's Guide p. 229.)
Gossip Collector					KEY:Social Talent ~ Gossip Collector			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Gossip Collector		SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante sits at the center of a web of gossip, granting him access to the latest scuttlebutt with baffling speed. Whenever the vigilante is presented with a topic about which he would normally need to spend 1d4 hours to gather information, he must spend only 1d2 hours instead. If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 × 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip. This ability doesn't allow him to gather information that isn't available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.
Great Renown					KEY:Social Talent ~ Great Renown				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,7		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown		SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante is known on a broader scale. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks from his renown social talent while he is in his vigilante identity increases to +6.

Goods he crafts with a Craft skill he chose with social grace are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing the cost to create. Whenever he uses a Profession skill he chose with social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money.
Incredible Renown					KEY:Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,11		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Great Renown							!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Incredible Renown	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:The vigilante is incredibly famous in both identities.

Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a +%1 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information. In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks to track him by %2. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week. Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger.|VigilanteTalentLVL/2|VigilanteTalentLVL		BONUS:SITUATION|Diplomacy=Gather Information|VigilanteTalentLVL/2
Many Guises						KEY:Social Talent ~ Many Guises				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,5																				!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Many Guises		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion).
Mockingbird						KEY:Social Talent ~ Mockingbird				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,5																				!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Mockingbird		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the ghost sound, ventriloquism, and vocal alteration spells.

Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a full-round action. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a Disguise check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 additional round adjusting and perfecting his appearance and persona to negate the need for this check.
Renown						KEY:Social Talent ~ Renown					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person's initial attitude would have at least been indifferent. While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within %1 miles. A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that's one category worse, rather than one category better.|VigilanteTalentLVL		BONUS:SITUATION|Intimidate=In Vigilante Identity|4|TYPE=Circumstance.STACK
Safe House						KEY:Social Talent ~ Safe House				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																											!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Safe House			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The vigilante can establish a safe house in his area of renown, and he can change it every time he changes his area of renown. If he doesn't have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is %1 feet per side. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can't be located by any effect that is less powerful than a discern location spell.|VigilanteTalentLVL*10	DESC: This protection from being located also applies to creatures in the safe house.|PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,7	DESC: The entire area is protected from scrying effects (though not mundane snooping) like a mage's private sanctum.|PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,13

As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as discern lies, and he can say it in effects such as zone of truth that force him to speak the truth.
Triumphant Return					KEY:Social Talent ~ Triumphant Return			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Social Talent.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		PREVARGTEQ:VigilanteTalentLVL,3		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Renown								!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Social Talent ~ Triumphant Return	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:The vigilante's tales are never truly forgotten. This makes it easier to establish his renown in a place he has established it before. In any settlement where the vigilante previously gained renown, it takes only 3 days, rather than 1 week, to gain renown again.

This does not mean the tyrant can't take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ambitions. A tyrant's code requires that he place his own sinister goals above all else, respect rightful authority even as he twists its loopholes to his own ends, impose tyranny, and punish all those who dare dissent. A tyrant can accept underlings of any alignment; he cares not who serves him, only that they are truly loyal to him. He can even work alongside good-aligned individuals, as long as he is secretly manipulating them.

When determining the kinds of cohorts the daring general can attract, he treats his Leadership score as 3 lower for each subsequent cohort (effectively taking a –3 penalty for the second cohort and a –6 penalty for the third cohort). Additionally, the daring general can grant special roles to his cohorts. Unless otherwise stated, only one cohort can fill any given role at any given time.

Wild Mischief					KEY:Feyspeaker ~ Wild Mischief				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Features.FeyspeakerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										SOURCEPAGE:p.26		DESC:A feyspeaker can fool an animal into thinking there is food, a potential mate, or a predator nearby. This ability functions just like a Bluff check to deceive a character. To determine the result of the wild mischief check, the feyspeaker rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier. As with Bluff checks, wild mischief checks are modified depending on the believability of the false information. A typical domestic animal is not particularly suspicious of the feyspeaker (no circumstance modifier), whereas wild animals are usually suspicious (–5 penalty on the check). To use wild mischief, the feyspeaker and the animal must be able to study each other, which means they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as when influencing people, it could take more or less time. A feyspeaker can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.

Whenever she confirms a critical hit against a foe that is unaware of her presence, she ignores any damage reduction the target might have and adds her Wisdom bonus to her damage roll (this multiplies on the critical hit as normal); in addition, if the target has regeneration, the creature loses regeneration on the round following the critical hit and can die normally during that round. Creatures whose regeneration always functions are immune to this ability. Finally, if the umbral stalker deals energy damage to a creature unaware of her presence with vulnerability to that energy type, she deals 2 extra points of damage per die rolled.

This ability provides no benefits against enemies that have heard or seen the coaching. Affected allies receive a +%1 morale bonus on all Bluff, Disguise, Perception, and Stealth checks outside of combat made to avoid, deceive, or notice other creatures.

As an immediate action whenever an enemy confirms a critical hit against an ally within 30 feet, the vigilant defender can choose to accept half the damage. If she does so, similar to the shield other spell, any of her damage reduction, resistances, or immunities do not apply to the damage she takes.
True Vengeance					KEY:Vigilant Defender ~ True Vengeance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Inquisitor Class Features.UmbralStalkerClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural									SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:When a vigilant defender calls true judgment down upon a foe, if the foe has killed one of the vigilant defender's allies (permanent sentient allies, such as fellow party members or cohorts, not summoned monsters, animal companions, pets, or the like), the DC of the target's Fortitude save to avoid death is 2 higher. If the foe has not damaged any of the vigilant defender's allies, the DC to avoid death is instead 2 lower. This ability alters true judgment.

A cipher removes Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform from his list of class skills, and he can never use them with inspiration, regardless of any talents or other abilities he might have. A cipher can use his inspiration on any Disguise, Escape Artist, Knowledge (local), Sleight of Hand, and Stealth check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, instead of the normal investigator ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspiration.

A creature who would become aware of a cipher's presence when the cipher is within %1 feet must succeed at a Perception check against a DC %2 or the creature ignores the investigator as though it had not become aware of his presence. The cipher can spend a use of inspiration to raise the DC by 1d6. The affected creature continues to ignore the cipher until he attacks, moves out of range, directly interacts with the creature, interacts with another creature or object in a way the affected creature notices, or otherwise specifically draws attention to himself. If the cipher does none of these things, the affected creature can attempt another Perception check at the same DC for each minute the cipher remains in range. A creature that was aware of the cipher's presence prior to being in range of his inattention blinding ability is unaffected. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A cipher can affect only %3 creature with inattention blindness at any given time. Once a cipher reaches that maximum, he can't affect an additional creature until he ends the effect for an already affected creature. If multiple creatures enter the range of inattention blindness simultaneously, they all must attempt Perception checks; the inattention blindness effect affects the creatures with the lowest Perception check results, in order, until it reaches the maximum number of creatures it can affect.

This allows the forensic physician to identify the race of creature that spilled the blood, and the creature's age and gender (if any). If the forensic physician succeeds at the Heal check but might not have heard of the creature's race before, he can attempt an automatic Knowledge check to see if he knows about the creature. If he succeeds, he identifies the blood (and gains all other benefits of the Knowledge check); otherwise, he knows that he succeeded at the Heal check but the blood is not from a creature he recognizes. If the blood is in its original setting, and the forensic physician exceeds the DC by 5 or more, he can study the blood to determine a rough estimate of when the blood was shed, and he can study the bloodstain patterns to get an approximate idea of how the creatures involved were positioned and moving.

Favored Nation					KEY:Dandy ~ Favored Nation					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.DandyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.41		DESC:Each time he would select a favored enemy (1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels), a dandy instead selects a country with whose courtly graces he is wholly versed and studied. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against courtiers, officials, nobles, and gentry from that nation. Likewise, he gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A dandy can attempt the appropriate Knowledge checks untrained to identify such people from the selected country. A dandy gains additional favored nations, and can increase the bonuses of one of his current favored nations, in the same way he would with a normal ranger’s favored enemy.
Rumor Empathy					KEY:Dandy ~ Rumor Empathy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.DandyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.41		DESC:A dandy can alter the flow and spread of rumors in his favor. This functions similarly to wild empathy, except that it takes 1 day (8 hours of work), instead of 1 minute, and it affects the general tenor of a rumor instead of a wild animal. A successful rumor empathy check allows the dandy to increase or decrease the rumor’s tone by one step. For example, he could make an indifferent rumor friendly and thus positive toward its target, or an unfriendly rumor hostile and thus even more negative toward its target than it was originally. The difficulty of influencing a rumor depends on the size of the community in which it is spreading. The DC of the check is 15 in a village or smaller settlement. This DC increases by 5 and the number of days required to attempt the check increases by 2 for every settlement size category larger than a village-to a maximum of DC 40 and 11 days to affect a rumor spreading through an entire metropolis. If the rumor is only spreading through a smaller segment of the population, such as the elven district in a larger metropolis, use the population of that smaller segment to determine the DC and number of days of work required to use rumor empathy. The DC also increases by 10 if the rumor is about the dandy himself, since the dandy is obviously a biased source with respects to rumors about his own person.
Favored Terrain					KEY:Dandy ~ Favored Terrain					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.DandyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.41		DESC:A dandy gains favored terrain (urban), and though the ability continues to increase at the same levels, he doesn’t add additional terrains.

Hobnob						KEY:Dandy ~ Hobnob						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.DandyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.41		DESC:A dandy must choose his allies as his hunter’s bond, not an animal companion. In addition to the usual hunter’s bond ability, the dandy can spend 10 minutes at a particular event or party hobnobbing and introducing his allies to the right people in order to provide them with half the skill bonuses of his favored nation (though not the bonuses on attack and damage rolls) for the duration of the event. This ability alters hunter’s bond.
Dandy Spells					KEY:Dandy ~ Dandy Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.DandyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											SOURCEPAGE:p.41		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] The dandy gains a different sort of spellcasting than most rangers. A dandy uses his Charisma instead of his Wisdom to determine spells per day, DCs, and other factors related to spellcasting. He casts spells spontaneously from the bard spell list (rather than the ranger spell list) with the same number of spells known and spells per day as a medium (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 30) of his ranger level. This ability alters the ranger’s spellcasting.
Party Crasher					KEY:Dandy ~ Party Crasher					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.DandyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.41		DESC:The dandy is able to finagle his way into fancy parties, kings’ balls, and other social events meant for the cream of society. To do so, he must attempt a DC 25 Diplomacy check, which takes 1d4 hours. If he succeeds, he finds himself an invitation, an invitee looking for a date, a staff member willing to look the other way, or some other way to enter the party. This does not allow him to break into restricted areas or to infiltrate strictly closed gatherings, such as secret meetings; it only allows him access to social events.

Favored Organization				KEY:Guildbreaker ~ Favored Organization			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.GuildbreakerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:When a guildbreaker selects a favored enemy, he can opt to select a specific organization, such as a particular thieves’ guild, in lieu of a specific creature type. The guildbreaker must select this option for his first favored enemy, but he can choose either option for his later favored enemies. The guildbreaker’s bonuses from favored enemy apply against official members of this organization regardless of their creature type, but not against the organization’s allies, paid mercenaries, or forced labor. This ability only applies if the guildbreaker knows that the target is a member of the organization. This ability alters favored enemy.
Read the City					KEY:Guildbreaker ~ Read the City				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.GuildbreakerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:A guildbreaker spends most of his time in cities and large population centers. As a result, he gains an innate sense of comings and goings in the hustle around him. When in an urban environment, a guildbreaker can use the Survival skill to gather information, but only about the movements of creatures and what sort of people (races, social classes, predominant professions, and the like) occupy the community. Unlike with the normal way to gather information, the guildbreaker studies the signs of the city instead of asking around, so it doesn’t spread word about the nature of his questions to others.
Deep Cover						KEY:Guildbreaker ~ Deep Cover					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.GuildbreakerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Supernatural								SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:Guildbreakers may work to dismantle their enemies’ power structures from within, and they know how to gather resources and the necessary trappings in order to masquerade as a member of those organizations. A guildbreaker adds a circumstance bonus equal to twice his favored organization bonus to all Bluff and Disguise checks to appear to be a member of the organization (this does not apply on Disguise checks to change his appearance and replace a specific member, but rather to checks related to appear to be a general member of the organization). The bonus on Bluff checks from deep cover stacks with the guildbreaker’s overall bonus from favored organization if the person he is attempting to deceive is also a member of that organization. A guildbreaker posing as a member of one of his favored enemy organizations automatically defeats truth-telling magic (as if under the effects of glibness), but only for the purpose of claiming to be a member of the organization. Truth-telling magic can still expose him with a more indirect question, such as a member of a non-religious evil organization asking the guildbreaker for the identity of his patron deity.
Crowd Stride					KEY:Guildbreaker ~ Crowd Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.GuildbreakerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:A guildbreaker can slip through crowded streets with ease.

If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends, she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination effect and can’t be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme effects like mind blank). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under invisibility, silence, and negate aroma all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder’s location, ignoring any Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities. This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single spot. The sentinel can use this ability for 1 hour without penalty. Using sense intruder for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage to the sentinel, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour. A sentinel who takes any nonlethal damage from using this ability becomes fatigued. Each hour the sentinel uses sense intruder also counts as 1 hour of hustling overland for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage the sentinel takes in a single day. Starting at 10th level, whenever the sentinel gains a combat style feat, she can choose to trade it for a 10-foot increase in the radius of this ability. This ability replaces the combat style feat gained at 6th level and alters combat style feats.|SentinelSenseIntruderRange		DEFINE:SentinelSenseIntruderRange|0	BONUS:VAR|SentinelSenseIntruderRange|20	DEFINE:Sentinel_Style_Feat_Improved_Sense_Intruder|0	BONUS:VAR|Sentinel_Style_Feat_Improved_Sense_Intruder|1

The transporter’s course of travel is almost never direct, as it is optimized for smuggling. Thereafter, the transporter gains a +2 bonus on initiative, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks involving traveling along his plotted course.

If the transporter ever strays from the course or attempts to plot a new course for any reason, he loses the benefits of his current course immediately. A transporter can retry his Knowledge (geography) check to plot a course as long as he spends 1d4 hours each time.

Instead of granting the transporter’s favored enemy bonus to his allies as a move action, he instead grants his plot course bonus to his allies constantly. This ability alters hunter’s bond.
Hideaway						KEY:Transporter ~ Hideaway					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Features.TransporterClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										SOURCEPAGE:p.43		DESC:A transporter can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 20 Survival check to create a hidden shelter, useful for staying unseen by patrols of enemy creatures. The transporter’s shelter can hold the transporter and one additional creature for every 2 by which the transporter exceeds the DC. The created shelter incorporates scents from the local area, preventing creatures on the inside from being detected by the scent ability of creatures outside of the shelter, and vice versa. Additionally, its floor is either elevated or constructed of a different substance than the nearby ground, preventing creatures outside of the shelter from using tremorsense to detect creatures inside, and vice versa. Finally, the clever structure of the hideaway causes creatures outside of the shelter to take a –10 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures inside, as if through a 1-foot-thick wall, while only causing creatures inside to take a –2 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures outside. These bonuses do not apply if the enemy creatures are intimately familiar with the area in which the hideaway was built (such as an area right near their home).

# Rogue Talents
# ==============================
###These talents use RogueLVL rather than RogueTalentLVL because they are to be restrictred to ONLY rogues. While they are intended for Unchained rogues, it is suggested to allow them for all rogues.
Follow Along					KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Follow Along				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RogueTalent									PREVARGTEQ:RogueLVL,1	SOURCEPAGE:p.44		DESC:A rogue with this talent is familiar enough with enchantment magic to fool it, using spellcasters’ complacency to set them up for a surprise attack. Whenever she succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment effect, the rogue learns the spell’s effect on a failed save, allowing her to play along and pretend to have failed her save. If she does so, the spellcaster does not learn that she succeeded at her saving throw, even if she was the only target, though she must succeed at an opposed Bluff check against a spellcaster’s Sense Motive check to determine whether she is under the enchantment’s effects. While this ruse is in place, the spellcaster is flat-footed against the rogue’s first attack. If the spellcaster sees the rogue perform (or fail to perform) an action that would be impossible if she were under the enchantment’s effect, he automatically discovers her ruse.

Her sneak attack counts as a hidden strike with reduced damage for the purpose of determining the effects of her vigilante talent, which means, among other things, that she can’t apply any of the vigilante talents marked with an asterisk (*) to her sneak attacks.

This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week. Finally, once per day, the phantom thief can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the phantom thief must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the phantom thief (that would be easily accessible by the ally).

This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. A phantom thief can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person's initial attitude would have at least been indifferent. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within %1 miles. A phantom thief can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval.

#FAQ (pre-errata)

#Warlock Mystic Bolts: This ability says that it lets me count it as a light weapon, but is it manufactured? Do the bolts add my Strength bonus on damage rolls?
#Warlock mystic bolts aren't manufactured weapons; they're magical effects (similar to scorching rays or the flames from produce flame), and you don't add your Strength bonus on damage rolls.
