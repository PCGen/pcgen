Recondition				KEY:Technomancer ~ Recondition			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Through constant maintenance, a technomancer can keep a single piece of still-functioning timeworn technology in good working order. Reconditioning a timeworn technological item takes 8 hours, after which the item no longer has a chance of glitching when used by the technomancer and can be recharged normally by the technomancer but no one else. Keeping the item working requires 1 hour of maintenance each day (this can overlap with the time needed to prepare spells), or the item reverts to a normal piece of timeworn technology and must be reconditioned again. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a technomancer can keep an additional item in good working order, without increasing his daily maintenance time.																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Technical Expertise		KEY:Technomancer ~ Technical Expertise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A technomancer adds his class level to Craft, Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), and Linguistics checks regarding technology.

SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Technic Spell Mastery		KEY:Technomancer ~ Technic Spell Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:[Not implemented] At 2nd level, a technomancer selects one of the following spells: antitech field, destroy robot, detect radiation, discharge, greater discharge, greater remove radioactivity, infase robot, irradiate, magic circle against technololgy, memory of fanction, rebuke technololgy, recharge, remove radioactivity, protection from technololgy, or technomancy. (Additional technology-related spells can be added to this list at the GM's discretion.) If the spell chosen isn't one that's normally on his class spell list, he adds it to his class spell list at the level a wizard casts the spell. The spell chosen must be of a spell level he would otherwise be able to cast. If he prepares spells, he can prepare this spell one additional time in excess of the normal maximum number of spells he can prepare. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds the spell to his spells known, and can cast this spell once per day without using a daily spell slot. At 5th level, he picks another spell from the list above, and at 8th level, he picks a 3rd spell from the list above.												SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Arcane Battery			KEY:Technomancer ~ Arcane Battery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 3rd level as a swift action, a technomancer can expend an unused spell slot (if he's a spontaneous caster) or a prepared spell (ifhe prepares spells) to power a technological device he touches. Each spell level expended in this way grants the device 1 charge. Any charges unused at the end of the round are lost, and any charges used by the device that round that aren't provided by the technomancer must come from the device's own power reserves. He can use tliis ability to power timeworn technology. He can't power devices that don't use charges.																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Study Technology			KEY:Technomancer ~ Study Technology			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a technomancer can study a robot, technological object, or technological trap within 30 feet as a move action and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to identify it. Ifhe succeeds, he gains a competence bonus equal to 1/2 his level on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, saving throws, and skill checks involving the studied creature, object, or trap, as well as a dodge bonus of the same amount against attacks from the subject of his study. This bonus lasts a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If he studies a new subject, he loses his bonus against the previous subject.																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Recycle Technology		KEY:Technomancer ~ Recycle Technology		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 4th level, a technomancer can dismantle existing technological items and construct new ones from the parts, though such creations are prone to malfunctioning. He trades in each item for an amount of crafting potential based on a fraction ofits crafting cost (not price), as described below. He can use tllls potential and his technological crafting feats to make a new item. For example, a technomancer could use a broken laser pistol in place of 500 gp for crafting technological items (10%% of the laser pistol's crafting cost of 5,000 gp ). He then follows the normal rules for crafting a technological item (see page 16), except that he must pay at least 50%% of tlie crafting cost using recycled technology. Ifhe pays 100%% of tlie cost in tliis fashion, he crafts tlie item at double the normal speed. In tlie process of cannibalizing the old items, the new items are destroyed and any excess gold value is lost. The item he creates is considered timeworn technology, even if new items were broken down to build it. Recycle technology cannot be used to build constructs, cybertech, pharmaceuticals, or technology tliat uses nanites.	SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Command Robot			KEY:Technomancer ~ Command Robot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 5th level, a technomancer can issue a command to a robot within 30 feet as a standard action once per day. The command must be in a language the robot can understand. The robot can resist the effects of this ability by succeeding at a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the technomancer's class level + the technomancer's Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher). At 7th level, a technomancer can use this ability twice per day, and at 9th level he can use it three times per day. This ability otherwise functions as Suggestion, save that it is not mind-affecting and can only affect constructs with the robot subtype.																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Unified Energy			KEY:Technomancer ~ Unified Energy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 6th level, a technomancer can draw power from a technological device in his possession to cast a spell he knows (if a spontaneous caster) or a spell he currently has prepared (if he prepares spells) without expending a spell slot or prepared spell. He consumes 2 charges from the device for each spell level ofthe spell being cast. In the process of casting the spell, he can apply any of his metamagic feats, using a number of charges appropriate to the increase in spell level, but he cannot exceed the highest effective level of spell he is able to cast. He can use this ability multiple times per day, but never in excess of a number of charges equal to twice his technomancer level (so at 6th level, he can consume no more than 12 charges per day using this ability).																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Applied Learning			KEY:Technomancer ~ Applied Learning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Technomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 8th level, when a technomancer succeeds at a saving throw against a technological effect that has reduced effects on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely.
