The wielder make one attack roll when firing a nuclear resonator, then resolves that roll against the Armor Class of every creature in an 80 foot line from his position. The resonator's beam tunes itself to the precise molecular structure of the first creature in the line he hits, dealing 9d6 points of sonic damage to that target. Any other targets of the same creature type in the line which are subsequently struck take 5d6 points of sonic damage, while creatures of different types than the initial target take 3d6 points of sonic damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target hit by the attack to resolve the critical confirmation against. A creature that's critically hit by a nuclear resonator must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw to resist being stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds. A creature slain by a nuclear resonator is completely disintegrated (any gear carried remains unaffected).

When making an attack with a rail gun, make a single attack roll and compare that result to the ACs of all creatures in a line extending out to the weapon's maximum range. This weapon damages all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll. However, if the attack's damage fails to penetrate any target's hardness or damage reduction, this shot is blocked and cannot damage targets that are farther away.

By activating a control in the handle as a swift action, the wielder can switch the attack between a nonlethal jolt and a lethal shock. On a confirmed critical hit, a target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt by the critical hit) or be staggered for 1 round. When it's not activated, a stun baton functions as a sap. A character who is proficient with saps is proficient with a stun baton .
Stun Gun								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Stun Gun																	TYPE:Firearm.One-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological Gear.OneHanded.Nonlethal									COST:3000	WT:3															CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8		WIELD:OneHanded								RANGE:20			SOURCEPAGE:p.28																																																								QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge	QUALITY:Special|semi-automatic, touch				SPROP:A hit by a stun gun deals nonlethal damage-on a critical hit, the gun can attempt a free trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 1 0); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
Vortex Gun								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Vortex Gun																	TYPE:Heavy Weaponry.Two-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological Gear.TwoHanded.Force								COST:182000	WT:15															CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:10d6		WIELD:TwoHanded								RANGE:100			SOURCEPAGE:p.28																																																								QUALITY:Capacity|30	QUALITY:Usage|10 charges	QUALITY:Special|slow-firing, scatter, touch		SPROP:1 00-foot-long cone-shaped vortex of devastating energy; A living creature damaged by a vortex gun must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A critical hit also allows the user of the gun to attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 15); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Flying creatures struck by a vortex gun are affected as if they were struck by hurricane force winds. A creature protected by a force field takes no damage from a vortex gun but must succeed at a DC 1 8 Reflex save or the shot automatically depletes all of the force field's remaining hit points.
X-Laser								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|X-Laser																	TYPE:Heavy Weaponry.Two-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological Gear.TwoHanded.Fire								COST:40000	WT:10															CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:5d6		WIELD:TwoHanded								RANGE:200			SOURCEPAGE:p.28																																																								QUALITY:Capacity|20	QUALITY:Usage|5 charges	QUALITY:Special|touch							SPROP:The beam is stopped if it can not penetrate the hardness, fire resistance, or fire immunity of a barrier or creature.

An HEV suit completely protects against low radiation, and reduces the effects of medium radiation to low radiation, but it offers no protection against high or severe radiation. The suit's selfrepairing polymer resin fabric automatically seals secondary punctures or tears created by physical attacks to the wearer and damage dealt specifically against the suit. It repairs damage at the rate of 2d6 points of damage per charge consumed. While repairing damage in this manner, the suit's other protective functions listed above are any taken offline. An HEV suit has hardness 2 and 30 hit points.

This bonus to touch AC only applies to attacks made by beam weapons and rays-it does not provide additional protection to other touch attacks.

When in this form, it uses the statistics of smart armor (expanded form). It can be collapsed back to breastplate form with a move action, and automatically retracts when it loses power.
Spacesuit															PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Spacesuit										TYPE:Heavy.Technological Gear.Armor.ArmorProfHeavy														COST:90000	WT:35												ACCHECK:-8												MAXDEX:0										SOURCEPAGE:p.32	SPELLFAILURE:50														BONUS:COMBAT|AC|7|TYPE=Armor										BONUS:VAR|ArmorCheckPenalty|8																					QUALITY:Capacity|25	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hour										SPROP:A spacesuit is nearly identical in function to an HEV suit (see page 31), except that as long as the spacesuit is charged, it provides a bit more armor protection as well as complete protection from all radiation and exposure to vacuum. A spacesuit repairs damage to itself at the rate of 4d6 points of damage per charge consumed. It has hardness 6 and 60 hit points. A space suit is fitted with numerous small booster jets that grant the wearer a fly speed of 20 ft. (poor) in areas of zero gravity while the spacesuit is charged. The boosters impart no benefit in areas of high, low, or normal gravity.

Powered armor has hardness 20 and 300 hit points. Powered armor is fitted with numerous small booster jets that grant the wearer a fly speed of 60 feet (with average maneuverability) in areas of no gravity and 20 feet (with poor maneuverability) in gravity. As a standard action, the wearer may activate the armor's self-repair system . The armor consumes a single charge and repairs 2d6 points of damage. Only 1 charge can be consumed per turn for this effect. In addition, the following technological wonders are integrated into a suit of powered armor-each of these devices drains power from the suit's charges as appropriate when they are activated and used. Camera (see page 40) in the helmet. Commset (see page 42) in the helmet. Fire extinguisher (see page 44) mounted on the left wrist. Flashlight (see page 45) mounted on the helmet. Gloves that can function as grippers (see page 47). Laser pistol (see page 2 5) mounted on the right forearm that leaves the hand free. Firing this laser pistol is always considered an off-hand attack, and the number of times it can be fired cannot be increased by feats like Improved Two Weapon Fighting. Magboots (see page 49). Three medlances (see page 49). Each medlance can be loaded with a single potion or pharmaceutical; activating an integrated med lance is an immediate action. Power receiver (see page 51). Prismatic force field (see page 45) located on hips; activating this force field is a swift action. Radiation detector (see page 51) on the right wrist. Custom veemods (see page 53) in the visor grant a +10 bonus on Perception checks, lowlight vision, darkvision up to 120 feet, and all-around vision.
