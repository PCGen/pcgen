DESC:It's one thing to face a dragon armed with a longsword and a suit of magic plate mail, but what if you had an atom gun and powered armor? How many zombies could you blow up with a rocket launcher? What happens if you're standing next to a graviton reactor when it explodes? All of these questions and more are answered within the pages of the Technology Guide-an invaluable manual of items, hazards, and character options for use in science-fantasy settings like Golarion's Numeria, land of savagery and super-science!
