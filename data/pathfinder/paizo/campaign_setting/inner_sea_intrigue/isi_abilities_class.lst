This functions as the familiar option of the wizard's arcane bond class feature, with the tinkerer's effective wizard level equal to her alchemist level. If a tinkerer would gain a familiar through another class, those levels stack for purposes of determining the familiar's abilities. A tinkerer's familiar can take any shape the tinkerer wishes, but its statistics and abilities are identical to a clockwork spy (Bestiary 3 58) with the normal adjustments and abilities for a familiar applied, and it is a construct with the clockwork subtype.

Doing so takes 1 hour of uninterrupted work, and allows the tinkerer to create a wondrous item that functions for %1 hours per day. When creating such a clockwork item, the tinkerer must use materials worth an amount equal to the wondrous item's construction cost. She need not meet any of the item's other creation requirements. A tinkerer cannot create a mimicry of a consumable wondrous item or a wondrous item with finite charges, and she can have only one mimicry at a time. The clockwork item never functions as a wondrous item for any other creature. The tinkerer can spend 1 hour disassembling a clockwork mimicry and reassembling it into a mimicry of a different wondrous item. When she disassembles a clockwork mimicry, she can salvage parts worth half of the mimicry's creation cost. She still must pay the full creation cost for the new mimicry. This resets the duration the mimicry functions per day.|AlchemistLVL																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.47

Infiltrating Vessel								KEY:Nexian Spellspy ~ Infiltrating Vessel						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Features.NexianSpellspyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																DESCISPI:YES	DESC:A Nexian spellspy cannot use her familiar to deliver touch spells for her. Instead, the Nexian spellspy can cast divination spells through her familiar. When the Nexian spellspy does this, she casts the spell as normal, but she treats her familiar's location as hers for purpose of determining the spell's area of effect or range. The Nexian spellspy receives the spell's results as normal. This ability does not allow her to see through her familiar's eyes; for example, the Nexian spellspy would know about a powerful magic item detected through her familiar, but she would not know its exact location or exactly what the item looked like. Whenever a familiar would be able to deliver a hex, the Nexian spellspy can use the familiar as a vessel for her divinations in this way. This alters the witch's familiar.

Prepare Results									KEY:Nexian Spellspy ~ Prepare Results						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Features.NexianSpellspyClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																																																																																DESCISPI:YES	DESC:A Nexian spellspy's familiar can store the results of divinations for the purposes of providing false results to a rival diviner who has targeted the spellspy. As a standard action, the spellspy can store the results of one or more divinations she has cast within the past 24 hours. She can store results from any number of spells with a total spell level equal to the highest spell she can cast. The next time a rival spellcaster would receive results from any of the specific divinations whose results are stored in her familiar in this manner, the stored results are transmitted to the rival caster (and are removed from the familiar) in place of any real results. The rival spellcaster receives a Will saving throw (DC %1) to recognize that the results are falsified. Depending on the spell, the stored results from the familiar might make this falsification obvious (and thus no Will saving throw is necessary to determine the falsification).|10+WitchLVL/2+INT																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.43
