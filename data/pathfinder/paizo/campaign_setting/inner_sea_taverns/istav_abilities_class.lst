Alcoholic Alchemy							KEY:Mixologist ~ Alcoholic Alchemy		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																						DESC:A mixologist can infuse potions and extracts he creates with alcohol, increasing their potency. When a mixologist brews a potion, he can spend an additional 10 gp in raw materials to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of the potion's effects, but the potion counts as a strong alcoholic drink (see the sidebar on page 55). When a mixologist creates his extracts, he can spend 1 extra minute doing so to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of that extract's effects, but the extract counts as a strong alcoholic drink. A mixologist can prepare one alcoholic extract for each level of extracts he can prepare. A mixologist can't ever gain a mutagen or discoveries that alter mutagens. This alters alchemy and brew potion.																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.57
Alcoholic Bombs							KEY:Mixologist ~ Alcoholic Bombs		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																						DESC:When the mixologist creates a bomb, he can cause the detonation to produce intoxicating fumes. A creature that takes a direct hit from an alcoholic bomb becomes tipsy (see page 54) if it fails a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1). If the creature is already tipsy, it becomes drunk instead. If the creature is already drunk, it becomes soused instead. A soused creature that fails its Fortitude saving throw passes out for 1d3 hours and wakes up with a hangover. This ability counts as a discovery that modifies bombs, so it doesn't stack with other discoveries that modify bombs.|AlchemistDiscoveryDC																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.58
Alcoholic Resistance						KEY:Mixologist ~ Alcoholic Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																						DESC:A mixologist's bonus on saving throws against poison also applies on saving throws to become less drunk and to avoid passing out. This doesn't allow a mixologist to become immune to alcohol. This alters poison resistance.																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.58
Mixologist Master							KEY:Mixologist ~ Mixologist Master		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																						DESC:A mixologist can have up to two alcoholic extracts for each level of extracts he can prepare as long as he can prepare at least two extracts of that level.

Crowd Control							KEY:Bouncer ~ Crowd Control			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																							DESC:When in a bar fight, a bouncer has her tenacity (see page 56) reduced by the crowd at the end of a round by the minimum possible amount.

SOURCEPAGE:p.58
Lesser Flexibility						KEY:Bouncer ~ Lesser Flexibility		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																							DESC:A bouncer can use her martial flexibility only a number of times per day equal to 2 + half her brawler level (minimum 3 times per day).

SOURCEPAGE:p.58
Drunk Knockout							KEY:Bouncer ~ Drunk Knockout			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																							DESC:A bouncer can use one use of her knockout ability to attempt a similar maneuver in a bar fight against a major participant who is drunk or worse. She must declare her intent before attempting her brawling check, and if she hits and reduces the target's tenacity, that target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1) or immediately be reduced to 0 tenacity.|10+BrawlerLVL/2+max(STR,DEX)																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.58
Bar Fight Mastery							KEY:Bouncer ~ Bar Fight Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																							DESC:In addition to the benefits of close weapon mastery, when a bouncer confirms a critical hit against a major participant in a bar fight, she also reduces the tenacity of the crowd by her normal brawling damage amount (this amount isn't doubled). This alters close weapon mastery.
