Mixologist				KEY:Alchemist Archetype ~ Mixologist		CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.AlchemistArchetype										SOURCEPAGE:p.57	DESC:Certain alchemists focus on mastering the chemical reactions between alcohol and the physical body. Though the powerful potions they brew can have drawbacks, they are at least pleasurable.

Alcoholic Alchemy			KEY:Mixologist ~ Alcoholic Alchemy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.57	DESC:A mixologist can infuse potions and extracts he creates with alcohol, increasing their potency. When a mixologist brews a potion, he can spend an additional 10 gp in raw materials to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of the potion's effects, but the potion counts as a strong alcoholic drink (see the sidebar on page 55). When a mixologist creates his extracts, he can spend 1 extra minute doing so to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of that extract's effects, but the extract counts as a strong alcoholic drink. A mixologist can prepare one alcoholic extract for each level of extracts he can prepare. A mixologist can't ever gain a mutagen or discoveries that alter mutagens. This alters alchemy and brew potion.
Alcoholic Bombs			KEY:Mixologist ~ Alcoholic Bombs			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:When the mixologist creates a bomb, he can cause the detonation to produce intoxicating fumes. A creature that takes a direct hit from an alcoholic bomb becomes tipsy (see page 54) if it fails a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1). If the creature is already tipsy, it becomes drunk instead. If the creature is already drunk, it becomes soused instead. A soused creature that fails its Fortitude saving throw passes out for 1d3 hours and wakes up with a hangover. This ability counts as a discovery that modifies bombs, so it doesn't stack with other discoveries that modify bombs.|AlchemistDiscoveryDC
Alcoholic Resistance		KEY:Mixologist ~ Alcoholic Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:A mixologist's bonus on saving throws against poison also applies on saving throws to become less drunk and to avoid passing out. This doesn't allow a mixologist to become immune to alcohol. This alters poison resistance.
Mixologist Master			KEY:Mixologist ~ Mixologist Master			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.MixologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:A mixologist can have up to two alcoholic extracts for each level of extracts he can prepare as long as he can prepare at least two extracts of that level.

Bouncer				KEY:Brawler Archetype ~ Bouncer			CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.BrawlerArchetype										SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:Some taverns employ bouncers to keep out undesirables or for when their customers get too rowdy.

Crowd Control			KEY:Bouncer ~ Crowd Control				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:When in a bar fight, a bouncer has her tenacity (see page 56) reduced by the crowd at the end of a round by the minimum possible amount. In addition, when she takes the mix it up action, she reduces the tenacity of the crowd by an additional amount equal to her brawler level.
Lesser Flexibility		KEY:Bouncer ~ Lesser Flexibility			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:A bouncer can use her martial flexibility only a number of times per day equal to 2 + half her brawler level (minimum 3 times per day). This alters martial flexibility.		BONUS:VAR|BrawlerMartialFlexibilityTimes|-1
Drunk Handler			KEY:Bouncer ~ Drunk Handler				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:A bouncer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate and Sense Motive checks against foes that are tipsy or worse. In addition, when in a bar fight, she ignores damage reduction against nonlethal damage her targets have from being drunk or worse.
Drunk Knockout			KEY:Bouncer ~ Drunk Knockout				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:A bouncer can use one use of her knockout ability to attempt a similar maneuver in a bar fight against a major participant who is drunk or worse. She must declare her intent before attempting her brawling check, and if she hits and reduces the target's tenacity, that target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC %1) or immediately be reduced to 0 tenacity.|10+BrawlerLVL/2+max(STR,DEX)
Bar Fight Mastery			KEY:Bouncer ~ Bar Fight Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brawler Class Feature.BouncerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:In addition to the benefits of close weapon mastery, when a bouncer confirms a critical hit against a major participant in a bar fight, she also reduces the tenacity of the crowd by her normal brawling damage amount (this amount isn't doubled). This alters close weapon mastery.
