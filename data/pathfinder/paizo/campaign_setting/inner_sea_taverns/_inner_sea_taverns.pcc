DESC:Your Adventure Starts Here! Whether they're seedy bars in a city's roughest district, upscale joints where society's elites hobnob over artisan wines, or sleepy boozing establishments in pass-through villages, taverns are a staple of every adventurer's career. They're a place to meet contacts, to collect the juiciest gossip, or simply to knock back a hearty ale in between monster-slaying sessions.
