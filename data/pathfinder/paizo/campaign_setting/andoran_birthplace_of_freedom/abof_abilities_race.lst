Fey Bargain								KEY:Candlestone Courtier ~ Fey Bargain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																						DESC:Once per week, a Candlestone courtier can grant a limited wish or a permanent +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. In exchange, the bargainer is cursed to be carried off in its dreams each night by the courtier to a never-ending fey ball that, while pleasant as often as not, affects the dreamer as nightmare, requiring a saving throw each night (Will DC 21 negates). The DC to remove this curse is reduced by 4 if the courtier is killed, and a successful coup de grace on the courtier with a cold iron weapon automatically ends the curse. Ending the curse also ends any noninstantaneous effects of the bargain. A creature can have only one fey bargain at a time.
Spellthrust								KEY:Candlestone Courtier ~ Spellthrust		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																																						DESC:When a courtier threatens a critical hit, it can trigger a spell-like ability with a range of touch against the target.

#Gremlin (Erinat)

Discordant Aura							KEY:Erinat ~ Discordant Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura																																																																																																																					DESC:An erinat radiates an aura that imparts both gullibility and susceptibility to mental influence.

This bonus also applies on opposed Charisma checks against a charmed creature within the aura.																																																																																																																																																																																																			ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(20 ft.)

Malicious Mischief						KEY:Erinat ~ Malicious Mischief			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																																						DESC:A pair of erinats working together for 1 round can present an item and compel a creature to take it. This functions as beguiling gift (DC 13), but rather than using the item in the appropriate fashion, the recipient is compelled to use the item to attack a random non-gremlin creature within 30 feet, even if the recipient must use the item as an improvised weapon. Additionally, a group of six erinats working together over the course of 1 hour can create an effect identical to malicious spite (DC 16) on any living creature. This effect functions at CL 6th, and the target creature must be either willing or helpless.

#Ragewight

Create Spawn							KEY:Ragewight ~ Create Spawn				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																																						DESC:Most humanoids slain by a ragewight rise as cairn wights (though with chaotic evil alignments) in 1d4 rounds. However, humanoids with 6 or more Hit Dice and the rage class feature instead become ragewights, retaining the rage powers they had in life. Such spawn are under the command of their creator until its death, at which point they become free-willed undead.
Savage Fury								KEY:Ragewight ~ Savage Fury				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																																						DESC:A ragewight can trigger a savage fury as a free action. It can use this fury for 24 rounds each day. These rounds don't need to be consecutive. The ragewight gains a +6 profane bonus to its Strength and Charisma and a +3 profane bonus on Will saves when using this fury. When a ragewight ends its fury, it is staggered for 1d4 rounds and can't resume its fury during this time. This ability otherwise functions as the greater rage barbarian class feature, treating the ragewight's racial Hit Dice as its barbarian level for the purposes of rage and any rage powers. NOTE: Stats given are for during a savage fury. Typical rage powers are animal fury, intimidating glare, knockback, superstition (+4 morale bonus vs. spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities), unexpected strike

Creatures beginning their turns adjacent to a sawdust slough are coated with this dust, revealing invisible creatures (as glitterdust, though without any of that spell's other effects) and dazzling creatures as long as they remain adjacent to it and for 1d3 rounds thereafter. In addition, creatures that breathe that begin their turns adjacent to the sawdust slough are sickened for the same duration (Fortitude DC %1 negates). Creatures that hold their breath before being exposed to the choking chaff aura are immune to the sickening effect for as long as they hold their breath. A sawdust slough's choking chaff aura is burned off when it takes fire damage, and does not become active again until the end of the sawdust slough's next turn.|CON+13																																																																																																														ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(5 ft., DC %1)|CON+13

When the moon is less than half full, a silverblood lycanthrope becomes fatigued during the night. On nights of the new moon, a silverblood lycanthrope becomes fatigued during the day and each night becomes exhausted and takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage.
