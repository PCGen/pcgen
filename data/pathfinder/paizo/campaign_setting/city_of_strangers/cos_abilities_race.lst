# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type										Description																																																																																																																																					Combat bonus				Vision				Source Page		Aspects
Consume Thoughts		KEY:Caulborn ~ Consume Thoughts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Caulborn Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A caulborn can consume the thoughts of a willing, helpless, or fascinated target creature with a touch attack, causing an idea or piece of knowledge to vanish forever from the target's psyche and become stored in the caulborn's own mind. The caulborn can carefully reach into the target's mind and remove one memory, as per the eliminate memory option of the modify memory spell. If the caulborn isn't careful or actively seeks to damage its prey, it can tear thoughts from the target creature and leave its mind in shambles, inflicting 1d4 points each of Wisdom and Intelligence damage. The target creature receives a DC 18 Will save to resist intrusion into its mind without losing memory or taking damage, though it must make new saves for subsequent attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.												SOURCEPAGE:p.62
