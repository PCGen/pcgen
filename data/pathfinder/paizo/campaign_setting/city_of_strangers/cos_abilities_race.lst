###Block: Caulborn
Consume Thoughts		KEY:Caulborn ~ Consume Thoughts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Caulborn Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:A caulborn can consume the thoughts of a willing, helpless, or fascinated target creature with a touch attack, causing an idea or piece of knowledge to vanish forever from the target's psyche and become stored in the caulborn's own mind. The caulborn can carefully reach into the target's mind and remove one memory, as per the eliminate memory option of the modify memory spell. If the caulborn isn't careful or actively seeks to damage its prey, it can tear thoughts from the target creature and leave its mind in shambles, inflicting 1d4 points each of Wisdom and Intelligence damage. The target creature receives a DC 18 Will save to resist intrusion into its mind without losing memory or taking damage, though it must make new saves for subsequent attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Cooperative Scrying	KEY:Caulborn ~ Cooperative Scrying	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Caulborn Race Trait.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:Three or more caulborn joining hands can scry on a place or creature as if using the scrying spell (DC 20), but with no limit to the spell's duration so long as at least three of the caulborn involved continue to join hands and concentrate. This ability functions at CL 7th (or at the highest CL available to the most powerful caulborn in the group). The save DC is Charisma-based, adjusted by the modifier of the caulborn with the highest Charisma score.
Hive Mind			KEY:Caulborn ~ Hive Mind		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Caulborn Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:Caulborn possess a partial hive mind that allows them to share thoughts and feelings instantly and telepathically as if they were one organism. As long as they are within 300 feet of their hive's brain-sack, if one caulborn in a group is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one caulborn in a group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No caulborn in a group is considered flanked unless they all are.

In addition, the brain-sack instantly acquires any piece of information learned by one caulborn that comes within 300 feet of it. This information may then be shared by any other caulborn with 300 feet.
