Part the Veil		KEY:Domain Power ~ Part the Veil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower										DESC:You can lace spells you cast with the raw madness that waits in the outer darkness. Activating this ability is a swift action that you must use as you cast a spell that targets a single creature and that allows a Will saving throw to negate or reduce the spell's primary effect. If the target fails to resist the spell, the target is also confused for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level as visions of the void cause temporary insanity. The victim can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect - these additional saving throws apply only to the additional confusion effect and not to the original spell effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.

It Came From Beyond	KEY:Domain Power ~ It Came From Beyond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DomainPower												DESC:Once per day when you cast a summoning spell, any one creature you summon is more powerful than normal. The creature gains the advanced creature simple template. If you summon more than one creature with a spell, only one of the summoned creatures gains the advanced creature simple template. A summoned creature that gains the advanced creature simple template in this manner looks unusually deformed or hideous. This ability only works on spells you cast as a cleric-it does not work on spellcasting ability gained from any other spellcasting classes you might have. This ability replaces the Guarded Mind ability of the Void domain.
Dragonbreath		KEY:Domain Power ~ Dragonbreath				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DomainPower												DESC:At 4th level, you may use a breath weapon once per day as a standard action. When you gain this ability, choose acid, cold, fire, or electricity-this determines what kind of damage your breath weapon inflicts. Once you make this choice, you cannot change it later. Your breath weapon fills a 15-foot cone, and inflicts 3d6 points of damage-this damage increases by +1d6 every even number level you gain beyond 4th level. A creature hit by your dragonbreath attack can make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half your cleric level + your Constitution modifier) to take half damage. At 9th level, you can use this ability two times per day, and at 14th level you can use it 3 times a day. This ability replaces the serpent companion ability of the Scalykind domain.
The Stars Are Right	KEY:Domain Power ~ The Stars Are Right			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DomainPower												DESC:If you prepare your cleric spells while the stars are visible to you, you may spontaneously cast any of your Stars subdomain domain spells by swapping out a spell of an equal spell level. Any Stars subdomain spells that you cast while the stars are visible to you heal you of damage equal to the spell's level as you cast the spell. This ability replaces the part the veil ability of the Void domain.
Dinosaur Companion	KEY:Domain Power ~ Dinosaur Companion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DomainPower.Animal Companion									DESC:At 4th level, you gain the service of an animal companion. Your effective druid level for this animal companion is equal to your cleric level -2. You may choose any dinosaur as your companion.
