An evangelist also gains weapon proficiency with her chosen deity's favored weapon.

Obedience				KEY:Evangelist ~ Obedience				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary													DESC:In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class, including all abilities gained from aligned class (see below), an evangelist must perform a daily obedience to her chosen deity (see page 10).																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.198
Skilled				KEY:Evangelist ~ Skilled				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:Evangelists possess a range of skills across multiple disciplines. At 1st level, an evangelist selects two skills to add to her class skill list. Once selected, these class skills can't be changed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.198
Aligned Class			KEY:Evangelist ~ Aligned Class			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary													DESC:Evangelists come from many different backgrounds, and they show an unusual range of diversity. At 2nd level, the evangelist must choose a class she belonged to before adding the prestige class to be her aligned class. She gains all the class features for this class, essentially adding every evangelist level beyond 1st to her aligned class to determine what class features she gains. She still retains the Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks of the prestige class, but gains all other class features ofher aligned class as well as those of the evangelist prestige class.																																																																																																																									BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Evangelist Aligned Class|1																													SOURCEPAGE:p.198
Protective Grace			KEY:Evangelist ~ Protective Grace			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DEFINE:AC_DodgeBonus|0		DESC:The evangelist's chosen deity rewards her with heightened awareness and reaction skills, making her more difficult to strike in combat. At 2nd level, the evangelist gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 7th level. The evangelist loses this bonus when she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC.

Divine Boon				KEY:Evangelist ~ Divine Boon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DEFINE:EvangelistBoonLVL|0	DESC:As the evangelist gains levels, she gains boons from her chosen deity. The nature of these boons varies depending on the evangelist's chosen deity. Each deity grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the evangelist gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the Deific Obedience feat on page 210 and the core deity descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these divine boons. When a divine boon grants a spelllike ability, the evangelist's caster level for the spell-like ability equals her total character level. This ability allows an evangelist to access these boons earlier than with the Deific Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|EvangelistBoonLVL|EvangelistLVL					SOURCEPAGE:p.199
Gift of Tongues			KEY:Evangelist ~ Gift of Tongues			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 4th level, the evangelist may select a new language as a gift from her chosen deity. She gains the ability to speak and write this new language fluently, so as to better communicate with those she meets in the course of her travels. At 8th level, the evangelist selects a second language to learn. The ability to comprehend these languages is an instantaneous divine gift, and spells and effects that dispel persistent effects can't remove the evangelist's gift of tongues.																																																																																																																																														BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Add Spoken Language|1+(EvangelistLVL>=8)																											SOURCEPAGE:p.199
Multitude of Talents		KEY:Evangelist ~ Multitude of Talents		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary													DESC:The evangelist finds herself in many strange situations requiring a variety of skills. Starting at 5th level, the evangelist gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on any skill check attempted with a skill in which the character has no ranks. This bonus applies only to skill checks that can be made untrained.																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.199
Spiritual Form			KEY:Evangelist ~ Spiritual Form			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural													DESC:Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist gains the ability to assume a spiritual form. Assuming this form is a standard action, and the evangelist can remain in spiritual form for a number of minutes per day equal to her character level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Returning to her normal form is a free action. The evangelist's spiritual form grants her telepathy to a range of 100 feet, as well as two variable abilities. Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist must choose the form of these two abilities, and once she has selected them they can't be changed. First, she chooses one ability score to which she gains a +4 bonus when in spiritual form. Second, she chooses one physical transformation from the following to gain when she transforms: wings (fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or a single natural attack (a claw, bite, gore, slam, or tail sting that deals damage as appropriate for the evangelist's size) as well as a temporary appendage capable of making such an attack if necessary.

To attempt to undo such a spell, the exalted must make a caster level check using her level in the spellcasting class to which she added her exalted levels (including the increases in spellcasting from her exalted levels) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the targeted effect. On a success, the exalted counters the spell or effect. On a failure, the exalted does not counter the spell or effect, though she can try again after 24 hours.

Examples of potential effects include returning a fallen ally to life and full health, teleporting the exalted and her allies to a location with no chance of error, or protecting a town from a wildfire. In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's nature is refused.	DESC:&nl;A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are calculated as if it were a 7th-level spell. When an exalted uses this ability to duplicate a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, she must provide that component.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.201

This ability allows a sentinel to access these boons earlier than with the Deific Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.

Aligned Strike			KEY:Sentinel ~ Aligned Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sentinel Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:The sentinel's righteous fervor allows him to cut through certain types of damage reduction. At 5th level, the sentinel gains the ability to bypass a specific type of damage reduction when wielding his deity's favored weapon. The type of damage reduction his weapon bypasses is based on his chosen deity's alignment. The sentinel chooses this type of damage reduction when he gains this ability and this choice can't be changed. He can choose only one of the aligned weapon types regardless of how many options he has based on his deity's alignment. For example, a sentinel of Iomedae can treat his weapon as axiomatic or holy, but not both. The choices are as follows. Lawful: The sentinel can treat his weapon as axiomatic if his deity is lawful. Chaotic: The sentinel can treat his weapon as anarchic if his deity is chaotic. Good: The sentinel can treat his weapon as holy if his deity is good. Evil: The sentinel can treat his weapon as unholy if his deity is evil.
