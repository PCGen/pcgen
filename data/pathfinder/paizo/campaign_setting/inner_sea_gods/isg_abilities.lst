SOURCEPAGE:p.198

Aligned Class			KEY:Evangelist ~ Aligned Class			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Evangelists come from many different backgrounds, and they show an unusual range of diversity. At 2nd level, the evangelist must choose a class she belonged to before adding the prestige class to be her aligned class. She gains all the class features for this class, essentially adding every evangelist level beyond 1st to her aligned class to determine what class features she gains.

Divine Boon				KEY:Evangelist ~ Divine Boon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:As the evangelist gains levels, she gains boons from her chosen deity.

At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the Deific Obedience feat on page 210 and the core deity descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these divine boons.

Spiritual Form			KEY:Evangelist ~ Spiritual Form			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist gains the ability to assume a spiritual form. Assuming this form is a standard action, and the evangelist can remain in spiritual form for a number of minutes per day equal to her character level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Returning to her normal form is a free action. The evangelist's spiritual form grants her telepathy to a range of 100 feet, as well as two variable abilities. Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist must choose the form of these two abilities, and once she has selected them they can't be changed.

Second, she chooses one physical transformation from the following to gain when she transforms: wings (fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or a single natural attack (a claw, bite, gore, slam, or tail sting that deals damage as appropriate for the evangelist's size) as well as a temporary appendage capable of making such an attack if necessary.

DESC:&nl; Potentially undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity, that require miracle to counteract. To attempt to undo such a spell, the exalted must make a caster level check using her level in the spellcasting class to which she added her exalted levels (including the increases in spellcasting from her exalted levels) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the targeted effect. On a success, the exalted counters the spell or effect. On a failure, the exalted does not counter the spell or effect, though she can try again after 24 hours.

In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's nature is refused.	DESC:&nl;A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are calculated as if it were a 7th-level spell. When an exalted uses this ability to duplicate a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, she must provide that component.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.201
