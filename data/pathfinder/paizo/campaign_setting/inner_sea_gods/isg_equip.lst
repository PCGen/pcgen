Five times per day, the wielder can as a move action create a featureless black "mask" of illusory cloth on the face of a willing target he touches. This mask obscures the wearer's identity and lasts for 10 minutes. Once per day, the wielder can activate the sword as a swift action; 1 minute afterward, the sword completely erases the wielder's memory of the previous minute (as if using Modify Memory).
Blade Of Three Fancies.MOD				TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.254		SPELLS:Blade Of Three Fancies|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=3|Color Spray,11		BONUS:SKILL|TYPE.Perform|4|TYPE=Sacred																		DESC:Three colorful silk ribbons tied at the base of this elegant, ornately chased +1 glaive flutter gracefully with every movement and never seem to get dirty. The glaive grants a +4 sacred bonus on one perform skill (chosen when the weapon is created).

Dawnfire.MOD							TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.254																																															DESC:This +1 scimitar has a twisted hilt that evokes a stylized version of Sarenrae's holy symbol. The blade is etched with a prayer to the goddess to redeem the repentant and consume the unremorseful. Once per day, the wielder can use Spell Combat (as a Magus) to make a full attack with the scimitar in one hand (with a -2 penalty on all attacks) and project a 15-foot cone of flame from the other hand that deals 3d4 points of fire damage to creatures in the area. This cone of fire does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and is otherwise identical to burning hands, except the flames are yellow-white and undead creatures in the area take 3 additional points of damage from the fire. The hand projecting the fire must be free  -  not wielding a weapon or holding an object  -  for the wielder to use this ability.

Pharasmin priests sometimes use these daggers during ceremonies sacred to the Lady of Graves, such as to cut umbilical cords of newborns or to lay beside the corpses of honored Pharasmins as their spirits travel to their resting place in the Great Beyond. A fate blade counts as a silver weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At will, the wielder can use Disrupt Undead.
Forgefather's Sledge.MOD				TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.255		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Resistance to Fire	BONUS:VAR|FireResistanceBonus|1|TYPE=Base																					DESC:This hefty +1 warhammer is crafted to resemble a dwarven face and is decorated with lavish gems. By speaking a command word, the wielder can transform the Forgefather's sledge into a blacksmithing hammer of any size suitable for the wielder's size and strength or back into its weapon form. The weapon grants the wielder fire resistance 1. If the wielder places the Forgefather's sledge in a Small or larger fire (such as a campfire, forge, or wood-burning stove) for at least 1 minute, the hammer's head glows bright red from the heat for 1d4 minutes, though the handle remains cool to the touch. If used in combat during this time, the hammer deals 1 point of fire damage to creatures struck in addition to the regular damage dealt.
Fugitive Finder.MOD						TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.255		BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Walk|10																																							DESC:This +1 human-bane light crossbow has a gold-colored metal lath and a keyhole-shaped slot for the bolt to rest in. The wielder gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his base speed. The church of Abadar typically commissions fugitive finders to aid officials in chasing down and capturing escaped criminals, but Abadarans also craft variants that have the merciful special ability instead of human-bane, giving the wielder a better opportunity to capture a fleeing target alive.

Hell's Eye.MOD							TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																															DESC:This +1 flaming light mace has an iron shaft and a polished ruby-red stone head, similar to a gemstone. Sometimes a diabolical eye or face is visible for a moment within the stone. The stone is suitable for use as a scrying device for spells such as scrying. Once per day as a swift action, the wielder can transform the mace's flames to hellfire for 1 minute. This hellfire deals half fire damage and half damage from unholy energy. Evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype take no damage from this unholy energy; good creatures and those with the good subtype take double the usual damage from it. Protection from Evil and similar effects protect against the damage from unholy energy.
Inheritor's Light.MOD					TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.256		SPELLS:Inheritor's Light|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=3|Inheritor's Smite																													DESC:This +1 longsword sheds light as a torch and when drawn emits a shining starburst around the hilt, similar to Iomedae's holy symbol. Any Cure spells or Lay on Hands effects used to heal the wielder of this blade heal an additional 1 point of damage per die, up to the effect's normal maximum healing amount. Once per day, the wielder can use Inheritor's Smite.
Kinbonded Bow.MOD						TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.256																																															DESC:This stout +1 longbow is engraved with images of leaping deer. Designed to prevent inaccuracy while hunting in a group, the bow is imbued with magic that allows the wielder to accurately shoot past an ally. At will, the wielder can spend 1 minute attuning the bow to a touched ally. Thereafter, that ally no longer provides soft cover against ranged attacks with the kinbonded bow. Only one ally can be attuned to the bow at a time.
Nail Of The Princess.MOD				TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.256																																															DESC:This +1 scythe has five onyx gems set into its blade. A creature with the ability to channel negative energy can expend one use of that ability to charge the weapon with power, causing one onyx gem per 1d6 points of channeled energy to glow (multiple channels do not stack; the wielder must be able to channel 5d6 points of negative energy to activate all five gems). Anytime the wielder deals damage to a creature with the scythe, he can activate one charged gem as a swift action, releasing its energy and dealing 1d6 points of channeled negative energy damage to the target. Alternatively, as a standard action the wielder can touch the scythe to a willing creature healed by negative energy (such as undead) and release any number of stored charges, each of which heals the target for 1d6 points of damage.
Obliviating Flail.MOD					TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.256																																															DESC:The head of this +1 heavy flail looks like a human skull with wicked spikes growing out of it. At will, the wielder can affect a creature struck by the obliviating flail with Lesser confusion as a free action (a successful DC 11 Will saving throw negates this effect). If the struck opponent fails its save against the Lesser Confusion effect, the wielder of the obliviating flail is automatically affected by this effect as well (no saving throw). If the wielder uses the flail to perform a coup de grace and successfully kills her target, she gains 1d4 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute per HD of the target slain.
Perfectionist Shavtoosh.MOD				TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.256		SPELLS:Perfectionist Shavtoosh|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=3|Cure Light Wounds|Know the Enemy		ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Improved Unarmed Strike											DESC:This long piece of cloth is so fine that it can pass through a finger ring. Delicately woven with multiple colors to spell out Iroran prayers, it is usually worn as a shawl or belt, or wrapped around the chest and shoulders - it does not use a magic item body slot. If wrapped around at least one limb, it grants the wearer the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. It may also be wielded as a +1 whip. The wearer can meditate on the shawl's sacred mantras to use Cure Light Wounds and Know the Enemy each once per day.
Quarterstaff Of Entwined Serpents.MOD	TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.256		SPELLS:Quarterstaff Of Entwined Serpents|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=3|Magic Missile			ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Eschew Materials													DESC:This +1 quarterstaff is made of wood carved and dyed to look like two entwined asps, one black and one white. At will, the wielder can use the staff to cast Magic Missile, creating two such missiles. One of the created missiles always takes the form of a glowing white snake, while the other missile always takes the form of a shadowy black snake. When held in hand, the wielder of the quarterstaff of entwined serpents can cast spells as if he had the Eschew Materials feat.
Redlust's Daughter.MOD					TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.257																																															DESC:This +1 flaming falchion is engraved with leering, long-tongued demonic faces. As a standard action, the bearer can will the weapon to transform into a +1 flaming kukri or back to its larger form. The weapon has an affinity for humanoid blood and remains slick and wet with it long after it would normally dry. If the wielder kills a humanoid with Redlust's Daughter, she can lick clean this blood as a move action to heal 1d4 hit points. Lamashtu's church also creates a similar weapon called Chillheart's Daughter, which is a +1 frost falchion that otherwise has the same properties as this weapon.
Rusting Teeth Of The Rough Beast.MOD	TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.257																																															DESC:This +1 greataxe has a corroded edge that constantly sheds metal shards and rusty powder, though the blade never gets any smaller and this doesn't weaken the weapon in any way. Whenever the axe damages a creature, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or a shard from the weapon lodges in the creature's flesh; the target is sickened until the shard is removed. Removing a shard deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the target, unless whoever is removing the shard succeeds at a DC 15 Heal check as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional shard is removed. A Rusting Grasp spell immediately destroys all shards embedded in the target.
Shooting Starknife.MOD					TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.257		SPELLS:Shooting Starknife|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=5|Jump|Color Spray,11																													DESC:This bright +1 starknife is engraved with a beautiful moth icon. When wielded, it leaves a trail of harmless starry motes that shed light as a candle in any squares the wielder occupies or moves through. These motes last for 1 round before fading away. Once per day, the wielder can speak a command word to use Jump (with a +20 bonus), but this effect immediately ends if the wielder loses its grasp on the weapon. Additionally, once per day the wielder can use it to fire a blast of motes, with the same effect as Color Spray.
Stormstrike.MOD							TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.257																																															DESC:This +1 trident has a green-blue metal head, a pole made of driftwood, and a sheaf of white human hair tied at the joint. The wielder of Stormstrike can speak one command word to use it as a frost weapon (which turns its tines blue-white), or a second command word to use it as a shock weapon (which turns its tines sea-green). Activating one of these abilities deactivates the other.
Umbral Chain.MOD						TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.257																																															DESC:This bloodstained spiked chain has a large handle-ring that glows a pale violet color when wielded in normal light. An umbral chain grows more potent in darkness. It acts as a +1 spiked chain when in dim light. In darkness, it acts as a +2 spiked chain. When surrounded by supernatural darkness (such as in an area of Deeper Darkness), it acts as a +2 spiked chain and grants the wielder the Blind-Fight feat. In daylight or bright illumination, the weapon temporarily loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and is effectively a masterwork weapon, though it resumes its magical functions once it's no longer in bright light. The violet glow from the weapon dims in response to ambient light, vanishing completely in darkness or supernatural darkness.
Vengeful Kiss.MOD						TYPE:Magic				SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCESHORT:isg		SOURCEPAGE:p.257		SPELLS:Vengeful Kiss|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=5|Invigorate																																DESC:This +1 deadly whip is made of braided black and yellow leather cords, and is as strong as a silk rope.

Once per day, a creature wielding the whip can use Invigorate.

Once per day, the wearer may use charm person. If Droskar is the wearer's patron deity, any time the wearer crafts a magic item, she may choose to pay half of the item's construction cost instead of the full cost. The wearer spends time working on the item normally, but at the time of completion there is a 50%% chance that the item turns out nonmagical and worthless. For example, if creating a magic bracer that normally costs 1,000 gp to craft, the wearer may craft it for only 500 gp, but there is a 50%% chance the wearer's shortcuts and cheap materials result in a valueless, nonfunctional item.

Clerics of Sarenrae prize glorious flame rings as facets through which they may channel their deity's divine will. Once per day, the wearer may speak the ring's command word to create a 5-foot-radius burst of flame centered on herself. This burst of flame deals 1d6 points of damage to any adjacent creatures (Reflex DC 14 halves), though the wearer is safe from this effect. If the wearer is capable of channeling positive energy, she may as a standard action expend one use of channeled energy to activate the ring's burst of flame, even if she has already spoken the ring's command word for the day. If the wearer also has the Selective Channeling feat, she may select a number of allies equal to her Charisma modifier to exclude from the burst of flame; these allies are not affected by the flame. This effect is otherwise identical to creating the ring's burst of flame by speaking the command word.
