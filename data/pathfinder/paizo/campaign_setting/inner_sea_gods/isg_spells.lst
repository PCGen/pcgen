The target mementarily takes on the semblance of a being of perfect order, like an archon or inevitable, so that all who can see the target know it is affected by the spell. This divine guise flickers over the target for only an instant and does not allow it to pass as a member of a different race.

The creature's  Intelligence becomes 2, and it gains a gore melee attack that  it can use as a primary or secondary attack. The gore attack  uses the creature's base attack bonus, and the creature gains  a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the gore attack.  The gore attack deals a number of points of damage equal to  1d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Small, 1d8 + Strength  modifier if the target is Medium, and 2d6 + Strength modifier if  the target is Large or larger.  The affected creature still retains its type, class, levels, and  Hit Dice. The creature's base attack bonus, base save bonuses,  and hit points remain unmodified. It retains all of its class  features and may still cast spells, though it must do so using  its newly modified Intelligence score. Any items equipped in  the creature's head slot meld into its body. Affected items that  grant passive bonuses continue to do so, though items that  require activation become nonfunctional for the duration of  the spell.  If the target fails to resist Baphomet's blessing, it also  becomes immune to polymorph spells (except for this one)  for the duration of the spell's effect. Undead, incorporeal, or  gaseous creatures are immune to Baphomet's blessing.

While the beacon of luck is in effect, you gain  a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws. As an immediate  action before a saving throw is made, allies within the area  can choose to benefit from this luck, rolling twice for a saving  throw and taking the better result. Once a creature benefits  from the beacon of luck in this way, it cannot gain the benefit  of this spell for 24 hours.

When you are hit with a melee attack, attempt a caster level check against your opponent's CMD. If your check succeeds, your opponent's attacking weapon or body part becomes caught in the field, as if magically affixed to your body. If your check fails, your opponent may retract its weapon. If your opponent's melee weapon becomes trapped in the field, the opponent may release the weapon and move away from you. If your opponent attacked with a part of its body (such as a fist, a horn, a tail, etc.) or it attacked with a weapon but refuses to release it, your opponent gains the grappled condition. Because you are not using any part of your body to maintain control over your opponent, you do not gain the grappled condition. Once an opponent's weapon is snared, you may attempt a new caster level check against that opponent's CMD on each of your subsequent turns to maintain the grapple. This is a standard action, during which you may make any of the usual grappling actions, but if you choose to pin the opponent, you gain the grappled condition as well. On your opponent's turn, it may try to retract its weapon or limb by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, the DC of which is equal to the spell's saving throw. While blade snare is active, you may make melee attacks and cast spells as normal, though you may not make ranged weapon attacks; the magic field thwarts such attacks. You may not snare more than one limb or weapon in the field at a time. If you already have an opponent's weapon or limb stuck in the field and you are hit by a second melee attack, you must choose which weapon or limb to snare. The other limb or weapon is unaffected by the spell.

Any time you take piercing or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood spurts from your body in the direction of the opponent who inflicted the wound, dealing 1 d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6, Reflex half). This spurt travels in a 10-foot line, damaging the first creature or object it touches, with no splash damage. After it contacts a creature or object, your acidic blood continues to burn that creature for 1 round, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 7d6).

The target must start casting this spell before your next turn, and the spell cannot have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Your alignment, prohibited wizard school, and other restrictions on your own spellcasting do not affect the target, nor do you suffer any backlash from the target's choice of spell. If you target yourself with this spell, you may spontaneously cast any prepared spell of 3rd level or lower without expending its spell slot on your next turn (this aspect of the spell has no effect if you are a spontaneous caster).

The arrow deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point per level (maximum +5). Beacon: You throw or fire the arrow straight up. When it reaches maximum range or a solid surface (such as the roof of a cave) it explodes in a peal of thunder and forms a forked bolt of electricity resembling Erastil's holy symbol, which lingers for 1 round.

Being awakened during this period interrupts the spell and cancels its effects. If you sleep with this spell prepared, you may automatically expend it while you sleep to gain the spell's benefit. This expenditure does not count as spellcasting for the purpose of determining available spell slots (you could go to sleep at midnight, expend this spell during an 8-hour period of sleep, and still prepare your full allotment of spells in the morning).

You do not choose what shape the target's face takes, and the shape is different every time you cast the spell. This transformation does not interfere with the target's senses or its ability to breathe, though it might prevent it from speaking. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. If the target does not normally have a bite attack, it gains a bite attack as a natural weapon for the duration of the spell. This bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage if the target is Medium, 1d4 points of damage if the target is Small, or 1d8 points of damage if the creature is Large.

In response to a triggering condition you determine, up to the last 5 minutes of the target's memory are eliminated and replaced with a memory of your choosing (or no memory at all). For example, you could cast this on an assassin, set it to trigger when he completes his kill, and replace his memory of the murder with the memory of him discovering the body and picking up the murder weapon. You can cast this spell multiple times on the same target, even with the same trigger, affecting different memories. A single casting of false alibi affects a creature only until the specified condition has been triggered; once a condition has been triggered and the target's memory altered, that condition no longer triggers this spell unless the victim is subject to another casting of false alibi that specifies the same trigger.

The next instantaneous area damage spell of 3rd level or lower that you cast deals only 75%% of its damage, but heals you of a number of hit points equal to the remaining 250 of the spell's damage. For example, if you cast this spell and followed it with a fireball that would normally deal 40 hit points of damage, the fireball instead deals 30 hit points of damage and heals you of 10 hit points of damage. The spell affected by this spell must be cast before the end of your next turn. This spell has no effect on spells that do not deal damage or spells higher than 3rd level. This healing is treated as if you had been affected by a cure or inflict spell (whichever would heal you), and is treated as the same spell level as the area-affecting spell for the purpose of effects that relate to the spell level of cure or inflict spells.

If the target was prone at the time of casting, you can choose for the target to be standing upon reaching the destination. Furthermore, if the target was bound with nonmagical ropes, manacles, or other restraints, those restraints are not transported with the target, effectively freeing the target from those restraints. If the target is bound by magical restraints, you can bar those restraints from being transported with the target with a successful caster level check against a DC based on the restraints' caster level (DC = 11 + the restraining magic item's or spell's caster level).

While cold to the touch, it does not harm the wearer, especially if worn over normal clothing (though it can hasten the effects of exposure in cold environments). It offers the same protection as a breastplate, except it has hardness O and 30 hit points. If the intended wearer is immersed in water when you cast this spell, you may form the armor around the wearer (who may be you); otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally. Attacks against the wearer that create heat or fire degrade the armor, reducing its armor bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when the armor's bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends. Because the ice is slightly buoyant, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Swim checks, except when swimming downward. Druids can wear ice armor without penalty.

At the end of each round within this terrifying oubliette, the target can attempt a Will saving throw in order to escape the prison. The saving throw has a penalty equal to the number of rounds the target has spent in the oubliette (minimum -1 and maximum -5). If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it returns to its former space. If that space is occupied or otherwise unavailable, the target is shunted to the nearest available space. When the target returns from the oubliette, it is confused for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds of imprisonment (minimum 1), unless it was confined in the oubliette for 10 or more rounds, in which case the target is affected as if it were subject to an insanity spell instead.

These new forms do not allow the subject to fly, run faster, or swim better; however, they do act as natural weapons of the appropriate type, and the subject can use them to make secondary attacks while making attacks with weapons as a full-attack action. The secondary attacks are made using the creature's base attack bonus -5 and adding only 1/2 the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls. The subject cannot hold a weapon or use any item that would ordinarily fit into the slot of the changed extremity. The subject can receive the benefits of this spell multiple times.

You create an immobile wall of tiny black blades that whirl and tear into creatures like a cyclone. Anyone who enters this space takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), though a successful Reflex save halves the damage.

This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though you do provoke one for casting the spell), nor are you knocked prone if you fail the check by 10 or more. Unlike with a regular trip attack, you can trip any creature touching the ground, regardless of size. Improved Trip does not affect this spell in any way.

This is similar to the secret messages ability of the Bluff skill, but no check is needed; the speaker's intended recipient always understands the hidden message perfectly, but other listeners cannot perceive the message at all. The target can send only one message at a time, though it can send that message to multiple listeners. The secret message is considered to be in the same language the target is speaking, and intended recipients hear and understand both the actual speech and the secret message. The target can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. For example, at a fancy noble's wedding, a jealous former suitor casts this spell on himself before making a speech. Everyone hears his glowing words of praise, but only his allies hear his secret message instructing them to attack the groom.

You may not eat, sleep, or cast any other spells for the duration of this ritual. After the third day of the ritual, you must succeed at a Constitution check on each remaining day of the ritual (DC 1 O + 1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hunger.

This creature takes the form of a thunder behemoth (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 39) with the advanced and entropic simple templates. Unlike with summon monster or similar spells, the caster has no control whatsoever over the called creature. The spawn immediately heads in a random direction or toward an obvious target such as a population center, destroying anything in its path, yourself and your allies included. Any creature may attempt to control the called Spawn of Rovagug via spells like dominate monster or binding. However, if such an attempt fails, it draws the spawn's attention, and the monster immediately tries to destroy the creature that attempted to control it. Because the Spawn of Rovagug are all magical beasts native to the Material Plane, spells such as banishment or dismissal have no effect on the called spawn.

Once you cast transplant visage, the creature's stolen skin magically melds with your own, making the expressions and eye color on your new face seem perfectly natural. Your new appearance grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks. Because the alteration made by transplant visage is permanent, there is no residual magical aura, and your new appearance is not recognized by detect spells. Transplant visage may be cast innumerable times, allowing a single caster to wear layers upon layers of stolen faces. However, only the topmost face is visible at any one time. Transplant visage may also be used to remove a previously stolen face. This is the only way to remove a face short of using greater polymorph, miracle, or wish. When used in this way, transplant visage causes the topmost face to flake off and crumble into dust. A face so removed may not be reused. If the caster is wearing several stolen faces when the topmost face is removed, the next face down is revealed, and may be used as normal.
Unwelcome Halo	FACTSET:Deity|(Sarenrae)		KEY:Unwelcome Halo	SOURCESHORT:ISG	SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCEPAGE:p.244	SCHOOL:evocation	DESCRIPTOR:light	CLASSES:cleric=1|paladin=1|Sorcerer,Wizard=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:medium	TARGETAREA:one nongood creature	DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:yes	DESC:This spell causes the target to glow as if surrounded by a halo of light. This halo sheds normal light in a 20-foot radius from the creature, and increases the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet. This halo makes it impossible for the creature to gain concealment in nonmagical darkness, and in dim or darker conditions, the creature's glow can be seen even if it is not within direct line of sight. If unwelcome halo is brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa), the effects of both spells are temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist within the overlapping fields of effect.
Vengeful Stinger	FACTSET:Deity|(Calistria)		KEY:Vengeful Stinger	SOURCESHORT:ISG	SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCEPAGE:p.245	SCHOOL:transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:polymorph	DESCRIPTOR:poison	CLASSES:cleric=6|Sorcerer,Wizard=5|summoner=5|witch=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (a living wasp), DF	RANGE:personal	TARGETAREA:you	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates; see text	SPELLRES:no	DESC:You grow a long, wasp-like tail complete with stinger that can strike those who dare attack you. While you are under the effects of this spell, when a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack, you can make an attack of opportunity with your stinging tail, even if your opponent's attack would not otherwise provoke an attack of opportunity. You must otherwise be eligible to make an attack of opportunity to use this ability. The attack is made with your full attack bonus, and with a +2 sacred bonus on the attack roll. The stinging tail is considered a light weapon with a critical range of 19-20/x2 . On a successful hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage plus an amount of damage equal your Strength modifier and must succeed at a Fortitude save or it takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. This poison damage is also modified on a confi rmed critical hit.
Vexing Miscalculation		KEY:Vexing Miscalculation		SOURCESHORT:ISG	SOURCELONG:Inner Sea Gods	SOURCEPAGE:p.245	SCHOOL:enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:mind-affecting	CLASSES:cleric=2|inquisitor=2|witch=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:close	TARGETAREA:one creature	DURATION:1 minute/level or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:yes	DESC:You frustrate an opponent with ill fortune that leads even its most accurate attacks astray. The target is unable to score critical threats for the duration of this spell, even if the result of its roll would normally be a critical threat. If the creature rolls a natural 20, the attack still hits regardless of its opponent's AC, but the hit is not eligible for a critical confirmation roll. Once a critical threat has been foiled by vexing miscalculation, the spell is discharged.
