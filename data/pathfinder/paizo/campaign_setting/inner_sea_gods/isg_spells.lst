Abadar's Truthtelling			KEY:Abadar's Truthtelling			CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor,Paladin=1									SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				ITEM:POTION	TARGETAREA:Creature touched																DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.228	DESC:This spell functions identically to the spell zone of truth, except as noted above. The target mementarily takes on the semblance of a being of perfect order, like an archon or inevitable, so that all who can see the target know it is affected by the spell. This divine guise flickers over the target for only an instant and does not allow it to pass as a member of a different race.
Abstemiousness				KEY:Abstemiousness				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Witch=1									SCHOOL:Transmutation											COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				ITEM:POTION	TARGETAREA:a handful of berries, grains, nuts or rice												DURATION:1 hour									SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.228	DESC:Sometimes lrori smiles on his worshipers, granting them a reprieve from physical hunger. This spell magically enhances a handful of simple food, imbuing it with enough nutrition to satisfy a Medium or smaller creature for a full day. The spell does not create food, and thus will not alone prevent someone from starving, but it can extend even limited reserves for lengthy periods.
Aspect of the Nightingale		KEY:Aspect of the Nightingale			CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Inquisitor,Paladin,Ranger=1						SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph							COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			ITEM:POTION	TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes																				SOURCEPAGE:p.228	DESC:You take on an aspect of a nightingale. Your voice becomes clear and pleasant. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Perform (sing) checks and a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks. Once per minute, if you are subject to a charm effect that allows a saving throw, you may roll twice and take the more favorable result.
Baphomet's Blessing			KEY:Baphomet's Blessing				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph							COMPS:V, M,/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One living creature															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds							SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.229	DESC:You change the target's head into that of a bull. The creature's  Intelligence becomes 2, and it gains a gore melee attack that  it can use as a primary or secondary attack. The gore attack  uses the creature's base attack bonus, and the creature gains  a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the gore attack.  The gore attack deals a number of points of damage equal to  1d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Small, 1d8 + Strength  modifier if the target is Medium, and 2d6 + Strength modifier if  the target is Large or larger.  The affected creature still retains its type, class, levels, and  Hit Dice. The creature's base attack bonus, base save bonuses,  and hit points remain unmodified. It retains all of its class  features and may still cast spells, though it must do so using  its newly modified Intelligence score. Any items equipped in  the creature's head slot meld into its body. Affected items that  grant passive bonuses continue to do so, though items that  require activation become nonfunctional for the duration of  the spell.  If the target fails to resist Baphomet's blessing, it also  becomes immune to polymorph spells (except for this one)  for the duration of the spell's effect. Undead, incorporeal, or  gaseous creatures are immune to Baphomet's blessing.
Beacon of Luck				KEY:Beacon of Luck				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric=3|Inquisitor,Paladin=4							SCHOOL:Divination												COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal; see text			TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]																				SOURCEPAGE:p.229	DESC:You send out a burst of luck with a 30-foot radius centered  around you. While the beacon of luck is in effect, you gain  a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws. As an immediate  action before a saving throw is made, allies within the area  can choose to benefit from this luck, rolling twice for a saving  throw and taking the better result. Once a creature benefits  from the beacon of luck in this way, it cannot gain the benefit  of this spell for 24 hours.

Blade Snare					KEY:Blade Snare					CLASSES:Druid,Magus,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Abjuration												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.230	DESC:This spell creates an invisible magic field that does not stop weapons (whether manufactured or natural) from moving toward you, but impedes their motion when they are retracted. When you are hit with a melee attack, attempt a caster level check against your opponent's CMD. If your check succeeds, your opponent's attacking weapon or body part becomes caught in the field, as if magically affixed to your body. If your check fails, your opponent may retract its weapon. If your opponent's melee weapon becomes trapped in the field, the opponent may release the weapon and move away from you. If your opponent attacked with a part of its body (such as a fist, a horn, a tail, etc.) or it attacked with a weapon but refuses to release it, your opponent gains the grappled condition. Because you are not using any part of your body to maintain control over your opponent, you do not gain the grappled condition. Once an opponent's weapon is snared, you may attempt a new caster level check against that opponent's CMD on each of your subsequent turns to maintain the grapple. This is a standard action, during which you may make any of the usual grappling actions, but if you choose to pin the opponent, you gain the grappled condition as well. On your opponent's turn, it may try to retract its weapon or limb by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, the DC of which is equal to the spell's saving throw. While blade snare is active, you may make melee attacks and cast spells as normal, though you may not make ranged weapon attacks; the magic field thwarts such attacks. You may not snare more than one limb or weapon in the field at a time. If you already have an opponent's weapon or limb stuck in the field and you are hit by a second melee attack, you must choose which weapon or limb to snare. The other limb or weapon is unaffected by the spell.
Blessing of the Watch			KEY:Blessing of the Watch			CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor,Paladin=1									SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:50 ft.					TARGETAREA:Caster and all allies within a 50-ft. burst centered on the caster								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.230	DESC:This spell functions like bless, except as noted. It works only in the caster's home city, and in areas under the jurisdiction of the city watch. For example, if the watch patrols a shantytown outside the city walls but not the ruined subterranean tunnels that lie beneath the city, the spell works in the former area but not the latter.

Brittle Portal				KEY:Brittle Portal				CLASSES:Antipaladin,Cleric,Druid,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Transmutation											COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:5-ft.-radius spread															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds							SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.230	DESC:This spell weakens the bonds of existence, and reduces the hardness of any nonmagical surface within its area of effect by 2 per caster level.

TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius burst, centered on you													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D; see text]				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.230	DESC:Allies in the area of this spell at the time of casting gain a + 1 sacred bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus 1 temporary hit point per caster level (maximum 20).

Any time you take piercing or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood spurts from your body in the direction of the opponent who inflicted the wound, dealing 1 d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6, Reflex half). This spurt travels in a 10-foot line, damaging the first creature or object it touches, with no splash damage. After it contacts a creature or object, your acidic blood continues to burn that creature for 1 round, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 7d6). A second successful Reflex save negates this additional damage.

The next spell the target casts of 3rd level or lower does not expend a spell slot; in effect, you are using your spell slot to power the target's spell. The target must start casting this spell before your next turn, and the spell cannot have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Your alignment, prohibited wizard school, and other restrictions on your own spellcasting do not affect the target, nor do you suffer any backlash from the target's choice of spell. If you target yourself with this spell, you may spontaneously cast any prepared spell of 3rd level or lower without expending its spell slot on your next turn (this aspect of the spell has no effect if you are a spontaneous caster). The spell that's cast after channel the gift cannot have a casting time longer than 1 full round.

Attack: You may throw the arrow up to Medium range or fire it from a bow up to the bow's maximum range. Either use is a ranged touch attack. The arrow deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point per level (maximum +5). Beacon: You throw or fire the arrow straight up. When it reaches maximum range or a solid surface (such as the roof of a cave) it explodes in a peal of thunder and forms a forked bolt of electricity resembling Erastil's holy symbol, which lingers for 1 round. The thunder and lightning are as loud and bright as natural thunder and lightning, but they do not harm any nearby creatures.

Defending Bone				KEY:Defending Bone				CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Necromancy												COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged																	SOURCEPAGE:p.232	DESC:You animate a bone with necromantic energy, giving it the power to float near your body and interpose itself against physical attacks. This gives you damage reduction 5/bludgeoning. Once the bone has prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), it is destroyed and the spell is discharged.

When she awakens, she is sated as if she had eaten a nutritious meal, regardless of what she dreamed she ate. The target must sleep for at least 1 hour to gain the benefits of this spell. Being awakened during this period interrupts the spell and cancels its effects. If you sleep with this spell prepared, you may automatically expend it while you sleep to gain the spell's benefit. This expenditure does not count as spellcasting for the purpose of determining available spell slots (you could go to sleep at midnight, expend this spell during an 8-hour period of sleep, and still prepare your full allotment of spells in the morning).

Depending on the creature's alignment and its adherence to its ethos, you can provide it a brief glimpse of the reward or punishment that waits for it when it dies by showing it a mental image of its destined plane in the Great Beyond. If the target is good-aligned, it is fascinated for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is neutral-aligned, it is confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is evil-aligned, it is shaken for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.

The alcohol is of middling quality but perfectly drinkable. The spell also serves to remove poisons, diseases, minerals, and other toxins from the water as it transforms. The more contaminants that exist in the water, the darker the ale or the more full-bodied the wine becomes. The beverage's alcohol content is not affected by the presence or absence of contaminants. This spell does not work on unholy water, potions, or other liquids with magical power.

You do not choose what shape the target's face takes, and the shape is different every time you cast the spell. This transformation does not interfere with the target's senses or its ability to breathe, though it might prevent it from speaking. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. If the target does not normally have a bite attack, it gains a bite attack as a natural weapon for the duration of the spell. This bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage if the target is Medium, 1d4 points of damage if the target is Small, or 1d8 points of damage if the creature is Large. The target may use this bite as a primary attack or a secondary attack.

In response to a triggering condition you determine, up to the last 5 minutes of the target's memory are eliminated and replaced with a memory of your choosing (or no memory at all). For example, you could cast this on an assassin, set it to trigger when he completes his kill, and replace his memory of the murder with the memory of him discovering the body and picking up the murder weapon. You can cast this spell multiple times on the same target, even with the same trigger, affecting different memories. A single casting of false alibi affects a creature only until the specified condition has been triggered; once a condition has been triggered and the target's memory altered, that condition no longer triggers this spell unless the victim is subject to another casting of false alibi that specifies the same trigger.

Fractions of Heal and Harm		KEY:Fractions of Heal and Harm		CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation											COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:Instantaneous																						SOURCEPAGE:p.234	DESC:This spell channels a portion of the next spell you cast into magic that heals you. The next instantaneous area damage spell of 3rd level or lower that you cast deals only 75%% of its damage, but heals you of a number of hit points equal to the remaining 250 of the spell's damage. For example, if you cast this spell and followed it with a fireball that would normally deal 40 hit points of damage, the fireball instead deals 30 hit points of damage and heals you of 10 hit points of damage. The spell affected by this spell must be cast before the end of your next turn. This spell has no effect on spells that do not deal damage or spells higher than 3rd level. This healing is treated as if you had been affected by a cure or inflict spell (whichever would heal you), and is treated as the same spell level as the area-affecting spell for the purpose of effects that relate to the spell level of cure or inflict spells.

If the target was prone at the time of casting, you can choose for the target to be standing upon reaching the destination. Furthermore, if the target was bound with nonmagical ropes, manacles, or other restraints, those restraints are not transported with the target, effectively freeing the target from those restraints. If the target is bound by magical restraints, you can bar those restraints from being transported with the target with a successful caster level check against a DC based on the restraints' caster level (DC = 11 + the restraining magic item's or spell's caster level).

If the target can't fulfill this urge on its next turn, the spell fails. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.

You wield this spear-like bolt as if it were a trident (you are considered proficient with the bolt). Attacks with Gozreh's trident are melee touch attacks. The bolt deals 1d8 points of electricity damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). Since the bolt is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. The bolt can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

Hommer of mending can fix destroyed magic items (items with 0 hit points or fewer), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way.

If the intended wearer is immersed in water when you cast this spell, you may form the armor around the wearer (who may be you); otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally. Attacks against the wearer that create heat or fire degrade the armor, reducing its armor bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when the armor's bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends.

The target can send only one message at a time, though it can send that message to multiple listeners. The secret message is considered to be in the same language the target is speaking, and intended recipients hear and understand both the actual speech and the secret message. The target can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. For example, at a fancy noble's wedding, a jealous former suitor casts this spell on himself before making a speech.

The spawn immediately heads in a random direction or toward an obvious target such as a population center, destroying anything in its path, yourself and your allies included. Any creature may attempt to control the called Spawn of Rovagug via spells like dominate monster or binding. However, if such an attempt fails, it draws the spawn's attention, and the monster immediately tries to destroy the creature that attempted to control it. Because the Spawn of Rovagug are all magical beasts native to the Material Plane, spells such as banishment or dismissal have no effect on the called spawn.

Your new appearance grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks. Because the alteration made by transplant visage is permanent, there is no residual magical aura, and your new appearance is not recognized by detect spells. Transplant visage may be cast innumerable times, allowing a single caster to wear layers upon layers of stolen faces. However, only the topmost face is visible at any one time. Transplant visage may also be used to remove a previously stolen face. This is the only way to remove a face short of using greater polymorph, miracle, or wish. When used in this way, transplant visage causes the topmost face to flake off and crumble into dust. A face so removed may not be reused. If the caster is wearing several stolen faces when the topmost face is removed, the next face down is revealed, and may be used as normal.

Unwelcome Halo				KEY:Unwelcome Halo				CLASSES:Cleric,Paladin,Sorcerer,Wizard=1								SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Light				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:One nongood creature															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.244	DESC:This spell causes the target to glow as if surrounded by a halo of light. This halo sheds normal light in a 20-foot radius from the creature, and increases the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet. This halo makes it impossible for the creature to gain concealment in nonmagical darkness, and in dim or darker conditions, the creature's glow can be seen even if it is not within direct line of sight. If unwelcome halo is brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa), the effects of both spells are temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist within the overlapping fields of effect.

Vengeful Stinger				KEY:Vengeful Stinger				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5|Cleric=6								SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	DESCRIPTOR:Poison				COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds							SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates; see text		SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.245	DESC:You grow a long, wasp-like tail complete with stinger that can strike those who dare attack you. While you are under the effects of this spell, when a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack, you can make an attack of opportunity with your stinging tail, even if your opponent's attack would not otherwise provoke an attack of opportunity. You must otherwise be eligible to make an attack of opportunity to use this ability. The attack is made with your full attack bonus, and with a +2 sacred bonus on the attack roll. The stinging tail is considered a light weapon with a critical range of 19-20/x2 . On a successful hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage plus an amount of damage equal your Strength modifier and must succeed at a Fortitude save or it takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. This poison damage is also modified on a confi rmed critical hit.

Vexing Miscalculation			KEY:Vexing Miscalculation			CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor,Witch=2									SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One creature																	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until discharged			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.245	DESC:You frustrate an opponent with ill fortune that leads even its most accurate attacks astray. The target is unable to score critical threats for the duration of this spell, even if the result of its roll would normally be a critical threat. If the creature rolls a natural 20, the attack still hits regardless of its opponent's AC, but the hit is not eligible for a critical confirmation roll. Once a critical threat has been foiled by vexing miscalculation, the spell is discharged.

Geas/Quest (Asmodean).MOD		OUTPUTNAME:Geas/Quest (Will negates)			DESC:This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw. If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas/quest for 24 hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas/quest. A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do. Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Knock (Caydenite).MOD			OUTPUTNAME:Knock (welds, shackles, or chains)		DESC:Opens welds, shackles, or chains used to imprison or hobble someone. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, knock opens up to two means of closure. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Whispering Wind (Gozren).MOD		OUTPUTNAME:Whispering Wind (works through water)	DESC:You send a message or sound on the wind or through the water to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air or water. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sympathy (Shelynite).MOD		OUTPUTNAME:Sympathy (works of art only)			DESC:You cause a work of art to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named. Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 x 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object. Sympathy counters and dispels antipathy.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
