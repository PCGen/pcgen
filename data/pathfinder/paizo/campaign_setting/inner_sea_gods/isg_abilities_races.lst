###Block: Spawn of Rovagug Subtype Abilities
# Ability Name						Unique Key									Category of Ability				Type										Define			Description																																																																																												Ability							Modify VAR																					Source Page		Aspects
Hibernation						KEY:Spawn of Rovagug ~ Hibernation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:Spawn of Rovagug can sleep for years, decades, or even centuries and do not need to eat or breathe during these periods of dormancy. If a spawn of Rovagug is forced into an environment where it cannot breathe and would suffocate, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, a spawn of Rovagug's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.
Regeneration					KEY:Spawn of Rovagug ~ Regeneration			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyHP				DESC:All spawn of Rovagug possess regeneration, and no form of attack can suppress this regeneration; they regenerate even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If a spawn of Rovagug fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug has yet to be discovered.
Unstoppable Force				KEY:Spawn of Rovagug ~ Unstoppable Force	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:A spawn of Rovagug can always charge, even if its movement is impeded or its path is blocked by another creature. It receives a +20 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to overrun and Strength checks to break or destroy objects, and can make one such check as a free action as part of a charge. In addition, the natural weapons of a spawn of Rovagug ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.														BONUS:VAR|CMB_Overrun|20|TYPE=Racial

If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than the Maw. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while the Maw does not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon, or it can just try to escape the grapple. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the Maw's mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

###Block: Sarcovalt Abilities
Detach Head						KEY:Sarcovalt ~ Detach Head					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:A sarcovalt can survive without its head. Attacks that sever its head (such as those of a vorpal weapon) do not kill it. If attacked by multiple creatures, it grapples one opponent, detaches its head (which continues to drain blood), and uses its body to continue attacking with spell-like abilities. Its head and body share a common pool of hit points but are otherwise treated as different creatures while separated. The head is AC 19, touch 15, flat-footed 16 (+3 Dex, +4 natural, +2 size) and can fly at the creature's normal speed. The head cannot initiate attacks on its own, and if removed from a target, it flies back to the body on its next turn. The body cannot see, but it can perceive through the head's eye cavities if it has line of effect to the head.
Disease Swarm					KEY:Sarcovalt ~ Disease Swarm				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:A sarcovalt's vomit swarm ability summons a cloud of flies instead of spiders, which has a fly speed of 40 feet (good) and infects its target with filth fever instead of poison.

###Block: Lampadarius Kyon Abilities
Regeneration					KEY:Lampadarius ~ Regeneration				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyHP	DEFINE:RegenerationRate|0	DESC:Lampadarii are difficult to kill. They heals damage at %1 points per round, as with fast healing, but cannot die as long as their regeneration is still functioning (although they still falls unconscious when their hit points are below 0). Good weapons and effects or silver weapons cause their regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack. During this round, they cannot heal any damage and can die normally. Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage are not healed by regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. You can regrow lost portions of you body and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.|RegenerationRate		BONUS:VAR|RegenerationRate|2		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|%1 (good weapons and effects or silver weapons)|RegenerationRate
Semi-Incorporeal				KEY:Lampadarius ~ Semi-Incorporeal			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:Some of a lampadarius's body is composed of incorporeal shadow.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
