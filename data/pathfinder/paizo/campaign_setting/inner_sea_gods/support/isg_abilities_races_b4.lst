Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage are not healed by regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. It can regrow lost portions of its body and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.|RegenerationRate		BONUS:VAR|RegenerationRate|5			ASPECT:Ability Benefit|%1 (adamantine)|RegenerationRate
