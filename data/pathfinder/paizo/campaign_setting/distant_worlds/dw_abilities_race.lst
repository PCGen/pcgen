###Block: Aballonian
Rebuild			KEY:Aballonian ~ Rebuild			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Aballonian Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:Aballonian machines are capable of improving and adapting their designs. Each Aballonian starts out with one of the abilities listed below. For every two additional abilities it possesses, its CR increases by +1. Aballonians may also add the customizable abilities of animated objects (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14, Pathfinder Adventure Path #43 80), increasing their CRs by +1 for every 2 Construction Points spent in this way. (They are already considered metal.) Aballonians may adapt of their own volition, but it takes 1 day to add each additional ability beyond the first, and they must also possess the rare materials necessary to make such improvements. An ability can only be gained once unless stated otherwise.	DESC:&nl;Gain a plasma cutter that deals 1d6 points of fire damage on a melee touch attack.	DESC:&nl;Gain advanced treads that increase base speed to 60 feet.	DESC:&nl;Modify chassis to gain a burrow, climb, or swim speed of 60 feet. This ability may be taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time it is taken, it applies to a new movement type.	DESC:&nl;Add a radar dish that grants blindsight 120 feet.	DESC:&nl;Gain an additional claw or slam melee attack (1d6 damage).	DESC:&nl;Lengthen arms to extend reach by 5 feet.	DESC:&nl;Gain the rend special attack (2 claws, 1d8+6).	DESC:&nl;Add armor plating to gain a +4 natural armor bonus to AC.	DESC:&nl;Harden systems to gain resistance 10 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). This ability may be taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time it is taken, it applies to a new energy type.
Shortwave			KEY:Aballonian ~ Shortwave			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Aballonian Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:An Aballonian can communicate with nearby Aballonians via invisible waves. This functions as telepathy 100 ft., but only with other Aballonians. In combat, if any allied Aballonians within range can act in a surprise round, all of them can.
Spark				KEY:Aballonian ~ Spark				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Aballonian Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:As a standard action, an Aballonian can launch an arc of electricity at a nearby creature. This attack has a range of 20 feet with no range increment. In addition, whenever an Aballonian makes a check to maintain a grapple, it can use its spark attack against the creature it is grappling as a free action.
Sunlight Dependency	KEY:Aballonian ~ Sunlight Dependency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Aballonian Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:Aballonians gain their energy from light. In areas of darkness, they gain the sickened condition.

###Block: Brethedan
Adaptation	KEY:Brethedan ~ Adaptation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brethedan Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:A Brethedan's body is extremely mutable, and can adapt to respond to virtually any situation. Once per round as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a Brethedan can reshape its body and chemistry to adopt any of the following qualities. • Resistance 5 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). • An additional natural attack (tentacle, bite, etc.) with damage appropriate to the Brethedan's size. • Change its slam damage type to slashing or piercing. • Increase its slam damage die by one step (from 1d6 to 1d8 for most Brethedans). • Gain a +4 natural armor bonus to AC. • Extend its reach to 20 feet. A Brethedan can only have one modification in effect at any one time—a Brethedan that selects a new adaptation loses any other in effect. More extreme adaptations are also possible (at the GM's discretion) but generally take days or even months to adopt.
Combine	KEY:Brethedan ~ Combine		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brethedan Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:Thanks to their perfect communication, Brethedans can combine to work together as parts of a larger organism. As a swift action, a Brethedan adjacent to another can merge with it, becoming a single creature occupying both spaces. The merging Brethedan forfeits its actions to augment the other, and adds its hit points (though not its Hit Dice) to the new creature's collective total. At this time, it also chooses one adaptation—the combined creature gains this benefit, and it cannot be changed unless the combined creature uses its single adaptation action each round to do so. Any number of Brethedans can merge in this fashion, but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation each round (not once per component creature). Splitting into the component creatures again is a full-round action, in which all component creatures are released and the remaining hit points are divided evenly. For the purposes of Hit Dice-related effects, the Hit Dice of a combined Brethedan are equal to those of the component creature with the highest CR.
Constrict	KEY:Brethedan ~ Constrict	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brethedan Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:(1d6+4)
Engulf	KEY:Brethedan ~ Engulf		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Brethedan Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:(DC 17, 1d6 acid and paralysis)

###Block: Dragonkin
Rider Bond		KEY:Dragonkin ~ Rider Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonkin Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:A dragonkin can form a permanent bond with its rider. Once this bond is made, a dragonkin cannot form another rider bond until its current rider dies. A dragonkin and its rider can communicate with each other as if they both had telepathy 100 ft. In combat, when a rider is mounted on his dragonkin, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest result as their single result.
Breath Weapon	KEY:Dragonkin ~ Breath Weapon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonkin Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:(30-ft. cone, 9d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 20 half, usable every 1d4 rounds)

###Block: Oma
Capsize	KEY:Oma ~ Capsize		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Oma Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:An oma can attempt to capsize a spacecraft or airship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the oma's size, the oma takes a cumulative –10 penalty on this combat maneuver check.
Carrier	KEY:Oma ~ Carrier		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Oma Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:A creature swallowed whole by an oma can forgo attempts to cut itself out and instead make a DC 20 Reflex save on its turn. Success allows the creature to move into the creature's larger second stomach, where it can ride safely for an indefinite period without taking damage. When a passenger wishes to leave, it can cut its way free using the normal rules, or make an additional DC 20 Reflex save to be safely excreted in an adjacent square. An oma's carrier stomach can hold up to one Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of the next smallest size, so two Huge creatures, four Large, etc.). At its option, an oma can choose to forgo the normal bite damage of swallowing whole, but not the acid damage of the first stomach.
Starflight	KEY:Oma ~ Starflight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Oma Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:An oma can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip between two planets within a single solar system should take 3d20 days, while a trip to another solar system should take 3d20 weeks (or more, at the GM's discretion), provided the oma knows the way to its destination.


Spell-Like Abilities		KEY:Contemplative of Ashok ~ Spell-Like Abilities	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Contemplative of Ashok Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.60	DESC:(CL 4th; concentration +9) Constant—detect magic, mage hand, read magic, tongues At will—daze (DC 15), detect thoughts (DC 17), ghost sound (DC 15), magic missile 3/day—telekinesis (DC 20)
