###BLOCK: General Items
# Equipment Name			Output Name						Type									Contains						Cost		Weight		Source Page															Special Properties
Air Tank											TYPE:Goods.General													COST:5	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:Price and weight is per gallon of air. Tanks full of normal air don't last long as breathing devices, but a large air tank is excellent for ensuring a character has a swiftly rising buoyancy, and a savvy diver can adjust her air tank just enough to give her a neutral buoyancy, making it much easier to explore underwater. Every 6 gallons of air is enough to breathe for roughly 1 minute underwater; it takes far less air for a Medium creature to achieve neutral buoyancy unless it's carrying a significant amount of metal and other dense material.
Air Tank (Pressurized)		OUTPUTNAME:Air Tank, Pressurized		TYPE:Goods.General													COST:25	WT:30		SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:An air-breathing adventurer would need to bring over a dozen tanks full of air with her to have enough to breathe for even a single hour. Since this is impractical, alchemists developed a technique to store greater amounts of air in a smaller volume using pressure. Each pressurized air tank is a little smaller than half the size of a tank, but it contains enough air for a swimming character to breathe for 1 hour (the pressurized air itself weighs 7 pounds, so an empty tank weighs only 23 pounds). When a small crank is manipulated as a standard action, the tank releases just enough air for a breath, which the diving character breathes in through a straw-like tube with a semipermeable end piece that allows air out but not water in. The process of refilling the air tank requires 5 gp of materials and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check (failure destroys the tank) or the services of a kineticist with basic aerokinesis.
Bottom-Walker's Anchor									TYPE:Goods.General													COST:5	WT:50		SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:This dense anchor is attached to a sturdy but easily detachable chain (removing the chain is a move action). Wearing a bottomwalker's anchor all but guarantees an undersea explorer a swiftly sinking buoyancy, though it also increases her armor check penalty by 1 and decreases her maximum Dexterity bonus by 1 (or sets it at +6, if the wearer didn’t have a maximum Dexterity bonus). Compared to simply carrying plenty of dense items, it’s unwieldy, but the advantage is that the undersea explorer can detach the anchor in a hurry in order to float to the surface, while unloading a number of dense objects might be a slow process (and could deprive the explorer of valuable gear).
Hippocampus											TYPE:Mount.Goods.Transportation.Container			CONTAINS:*690|Any					COST:500	WT:1000	SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:Though somewhat rarer than horses on the surface world, hippocampi are roughly as easy to train as horses, despite being magical beasts.
Hippocampus (Combat-Trained)	OUTPUTNAME:Hiipocampus, Combat-Trained	TYPE:Mount.Goods.Transportation.Container			CONTAINS:*690|Any					COST:750	WT:1300	SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:Though somewhat rarer than horses on the surface world, hippocampi are roughly as easy to train as horses, despite being magical beasts. Even combat-trained hippocampi rarely wear barding, and even then nothing heavier than leather, as it interferes with their swimming.
Jellyfish (Luminous)		OUTPUTNAME:Jellyfish, Luminous		TYPE:Goods.Lightsource													COST:2	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.56	QUALITY:Increases light level by one step|5 ft.	QUALITY:Duration|1 year		SPROP:This tiny jellyfish has a crown roughly 4 inches in diameter, and it glows with bioluminescence as brightly as a candle, typically in a blue or green color, but various species allow an array of possible colors (though generally this commands greater prices). When trapped in a container with small holes to allow in the plankton the creature eats, these creatures can serve as living lanterns, especially for creatures with lowlight vision. In some places, like Talasantri, they drift freely ascmobile light sources. A luminous jellyfish lives up to 1 year incthis stage of its life cycle before dying.
Masterwork Flippers									TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable.Boot.Masterwork									COST:50	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:These sleek and aquadynamic flippers grant their wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on Swim checks to perform complex maneuvers underwater or swim through rough waters. This bonus doesn’t stack with racial bonuses on Swim checks from having a swim speed.
Poison Sealant										TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable											COST:20			SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:Applying poison sealant to a poisoned weapon takes the same amount of effort as applying a poison. Once applied, the sealant protects the poison from the elements, keeping the weapon poisoned underwater. Poison sealant dissolves in blood, allowing the poison's delivery (and also meaning that it doesn’t prevent accidental poisoning).
Pressure Pill										TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable											COST:75			SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:When you swallow this marble-shaped alchemical pill as a full-round action, it instantly adjusts your body to the surrounding water pressure, though you take 3 points of nonlethal damage for every 100 feet of adjustment necessary (see Aquatic Adventures page 48 - Pressure).
Scent Salts											TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Consumable											COST:0.1			SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:Stored in a waterproof pouch, these salt crystals dissolve slowly in water, producing a pleasing scent in the nearby water for roughly 1 hour.
Sureseal Bladder										TYPE:Goods.General.Consumable.Container			CONTAINS:1|Liquid=1				COST:0.1	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:A sureseal bladder is made of a thin membrane that won’t allow liquid through. By passing a solid spout or tube through the membrane, you can fill the bladder without allowing in any ambient seawater, and the membrane seals behind the spout. Once the bladder is full, the drinker can nip on the end of the membrane in order to sip the drink at her leisure, slowly crumpling the bladder for eventual disposal. The cheaper mundane sureseal bladders hold about 2 cups of liquid and work best for enjoying a favorite drink; the listed weight assumes the mundane sureseal bladder is full.
Sureseal Bladder (Potion)	OUTPUTNAME:Sureseal Bladder, Potion		TYPE:Goods.General.Consumable.Container			CONTAINS:1|SpellComponent=1|Poison=1	COST:8			SOURCEPAGE:p.56														SPROP:Potions rely on drinking the entire dose, so potion sureseal bladders, while much smaller (just large enough for a potion), are pressurized in order to expel the entire potion at once without losing any of it, allowing the drinker to drink them as a standard action just like drinking a potion above the waves.
Underwater Goggles									TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable.Eyegear										COST:5			SOURCEPAGE:p.57														SPROP:These inexpensive, watertight goggles are essential protection for land-dwellers' eyes, particularly in salt water or water high in particulates. Any land-dweller wearing goggles can use visual Perception like an aquatic native (see Aquatic Adventures page 46).
Wet Suit											TYPE:Goods.Clothing.Resizable												COST:8	WT:4		SOURCEPAGE:p.57														SPROP:This relatively aquadynamic wet suit is designed for surfacedwellers exploring the deeps, with waterproof pockets to help keep important items dry.
