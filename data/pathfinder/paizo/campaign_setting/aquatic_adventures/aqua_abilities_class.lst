Aquachymist					KEY:Alchemist Archetype ~ Aquachymist		CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.AlchemistArchetype														SOURCEPAGE:p.49		DESC:The principles of alchemy work equally well underwater and on land, but mixing solutions and keeping them pure is a tougher task beneath the waves. Aquachymists are those rare few alchemists of land-dwelling and aquatic races alike who strive to unlock new and fantastic secrets of alchemy that can be discovered only in the water’s depths.

Sureseal Alchemy				KEY:Aquachymist ~ Sureseal Alchemy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.AquachymistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						SOURCEPAGE:p.49		DESC:An aquachymist’s extracts and mutagens self-generate a flexible outer shell of sureseal, similar to sureseal bladders (see page 57), allowing the aquachymist to craf a waterproof supply without expending a plethora of sureseal bladders. This ability alters alchemy
Underwater Bombs				KEY:Aquachymist ~ Underwater Bombs			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.AquachymistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						SOURCEPAGE:p.50		DESC:An aquachymist’s fire bombs deal steam damage, allowing them to deal damage underwater or on land. Since thrown weapons don’t work well underwater, when the aquachymist creates abomb, he either weights it or includes excess air as part of the action of creating the bomb, granting the bomb his choice of swifly rising or swifly sinking buoyancy and allowing him to target foes directly above or below him. If the attack misses, the bomb doesn’t deal splash damage, but instead continues to travel up or down until it loses potency at the end of the alchemist’s turn; the exception is when the aquachymist throws a swifly sinking bomb close to the bottom, in which case it might reach the bottom and explode there. Because of the strange aquadynamic features of the aquachymist’s underwater bombs, they have a range increment of only 5 feet above the water. This ability alters bombs.
Amphibious Mutagen			KEY:Aquachymist ~ Amphibious Mutagen		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.AquachymistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						SOURCEPAGE:p.50		DESC:An aquachymist’s mutagen allows him to breathe both air and water for its duration, in addition to its other effects.

This ability alters sneak attack.
Tidal Distortion				KEY:Tidal Trickster ~ Tidal Distortion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Features.TidalTricksterClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						SOURCEPAGE:p.55		DESC:While making a full attack underwater, you can give up one attack to create a tidal distortion. When you create a tidal distortion, you move up to 10 feet. If any part of your movement includes a square adjacent to one or more foes, you can choose one of those foes and attempt a Bluff check with a DC of 11 + either the enemy's Sense Motive or Swim modifier, whichever is higher. Your Bluff check is subject to any penalties the attack roll you sacrificed would have taken, and if you trade an iterative attack gained from having a high base attack bonus, you also takes a penalty based on that attack's lower base attack bonus (a -5 penalty for the second iterative attack, a -10 penalty for the third iterative attack, and a -15 penalty for the fourth iterative attack, if you manage to gain one). If you succeed at the Bluff check, the movement doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from that foe and the foe becomes off-balance (see Aquatic Adventures page 45) until its next turn. You can give up any number of your attacks in a given full attack to create tidal distortions, but you can't give up two consecutive attacks.
