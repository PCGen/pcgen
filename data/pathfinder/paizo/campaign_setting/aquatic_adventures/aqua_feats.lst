# Ability Name				Category of Ability	Type			Required Ability											Required Deity		Required Lvl	Multiple Requirements														Required Skill		PRETOTALAB		Var. Min. Value				Define								Innate Spells													Description																							Ability									Bonus to skill						Modify VAR											Source Page		Aspects												Benefits																																																																																																																																																																									FACT
Aquadynamic Focus				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Focus																																			PRETOTALAB:1																															DESC:Your skill with your chosen weapons is so great that you can use them underwater without impediment.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.57														BENEFIT:You don't take additional penalties on attack and damage rolls for fighting underwater with bludgeoning and slashing melee weapons for which you have taken the Weapon Focus feat.
Aquadynamic Shot				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Far Shot,Point Blank Shot																																	PRETOTALAB:4																															DESC:You use projectiles and special trick shots that lose less accuracy when underwater.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.57														BENEFIT:Your projectile attacks take a -1 penalty per 5 feet of water between you and the target. You still can't use thrown weapons effectively underwater except in special circumstances (see Aquatic Adventures page 44).
Deep Breath					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																													PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CON,15																									DESC:You can hold your breath for twice as long.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.57														BENEFIT:You can hold your breath for twice as long as usual (4 rounds times your Constitution score instead of 2).
Dolphin Circle				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dolphin Dart,Dolphin Style,Improved Unarmed Strike								PREMULT:1,[PRETOTALAB:10],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=10]										PRESKILL:1,Swim=10																																		DESC:You circle your foes like dolphins, forcing them to play into your attacks.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.57														BENEFIT:While in Dolphin Style, as a full-round action underwater you can choose a circular path starting and ending in your current space whose length is no longer than you could swim with a single move action. You circle around that path until your next turn, and this movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You are considered to be in every space along the path for the purpose of threatening squares and providing flanking for other allies (but not yourself), as well as whether you are in the area of an area effect. Other creatures can attack you (and touch you with beneficial touch spells) as if you were in every space along the path. However, you don't count as being in any of the spaces for the purpose of other creatures moving through an occupied space. At the beginning of your next turn, choose any space along the path to stop circling.
Dolphin Dart				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dolphin Style,Improved Unarmed Strike										PREMULT:1,[PRETOTALAB:6],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=6]										PRESKILL:1,Swim=6																																			DESC:Like a dolphin, you can quickly dart at a foe and retreat.																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.58														BENEFIT:While in Dolphin Style, as a standard action underwater you can move up to half your swim speed, make a single melee attack against a creature within your reach, and then retreat back to your previous position. Your movement and attack don't provoke attacks of opportunity, even if your foe has an ability that allows attacks of opportunity with triggers other than moving out of a threatened area.
# Benefits of Dolphin Style should only apply when the style is active.
Dolphin Style				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike												PREMULT:1,[PRETOTALAB:3],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=3]										PRESKILL:1,Swim=3																																			DESC:You fight like a dolphin, bunching your enemies up together to make it easier to pick them off.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.58														BENEFIT:You gain a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls against any creature adjacent to at least two of its other allies as long as you aren't flanking that creature, and your melee attacks ignore any bonus to AC gained by use of the aid another action.

Murky Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																											DESC:You can call upon murky sediments in the water to transform a mist spell underwater.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.58														BENEFIT:You can apply Murky Spell only to a mist or fog spell that normally doesn't work underwater, such as cloudkill, fog cloud, mind fog, obscuring mist, or solid fog. When cast underwater, a murky spell clouds the water with sediments, producing roughly the same effects as the normal spell would above water except as follows. Due to the dilution, a murky spell has only one-tenth of the duration of a normal spell (generally 1 minute per level, though mind fog lasts 3 minutes), but this reduction doesn't affect the duration of secondary effects like mind fog's mental penalties. Abilities that see through mist and fog can't see through a murky spell unless they also specifically see through murky water (like the mistsight universal monster rule). Instead of wind, currents can disperse a murky spell; any current with a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a murky spell in 1 round. A murky spell has no effect above the water. A murky spell uses up a slot the same spell level as the spell's actual level.	FACT:AppliedName|Murky
Pressure Adept				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																						PRESKILL:1,Swim=5																																			DESC:You've spent so much time at unusual pressures that you've extended your native range beyond the norms of your species.																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.58														BENEFIT:Add one oceanic zone to your native range when calculating pressure (meaning that you don't take pressure damage in that range unless instantaneously transported up or down, and even then you adapt to the change all at once rather than 100 feet at a time). Surfacedwellers taking this feat must select the sunlight zone, and aquatic creatures can select any zone either directly above or directly below their native range.
Shark Leap					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shart Tear,Shark Style,Improved Unarmed Strike								PREMULT:1,[PRETOTALAB:10],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=10]										PRESKILL:1,Swim=10																																		DESC:Like a deadly predator, you bolt at unsuspecting foes from below.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.58														BENEFIT:While in Shark Style, when you're underwater with neutral, rising, or swiftly rising buoyancy, you can perform a terrifying leap to attack opponents directly above you. This works similarly to the charge action, except you can move only straight up, and you make a single piercing unarmed strike or bite attack. If the attack hits, it deals double damage; if the attack roll's result is also higher than 11 + the target's Swim modifier, the attack knocks the target off-balance until its next turn. Like with a charge, you can perform a partial version when limited to a single standard action (such as in the surprise round); in addition to moving half as far as normal for a partial charge, the attack doubles only the damage dice (as per Vital Strike) rather than the full damage roll.
# Benefits of Shark Style should only apply when the style is active.
Shark Style					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike												PREMULT:1,[PRETOTALAB:3],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=3]										PRESKILL:1,Swim=3																																			DESC:You fight like a shark, shredding your foes.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.59														BENEFIT:You can deal piercing or bludgeoning damage with your unarmed strikes. Your piercing unarmed strikes and bite attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of bleed damage.
Shark Tear					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shark Style,Improved Unarmed Strike										PREMULT:1,[PRETOTALAB:6],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=6]										PRESKILL:1,Swim=6																																			DESC:You tear into bleeding foes and can smell their blood in the water.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.59														BENEFIT:While in Shark Style, you gain scent while in water, but only against bleeding creatures. You also gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against bleeding creatures.
Steam Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																											DESC:You've built off of some of the closely-guarded secrets of the undine steamcasters, allowing you to use fire magic underwater easily.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.59														BENEFIT:You can apply Steam Spell only to a spell with the fire descriptor. A steam spell works underwater without a caster level check, but it requires a caster level check to function above water. A steam spell uses up a slot the same spell level as the spell's actual level.																																																																																																																												FACT:AppliedName|Steam
Touch of the Brackish Emperor		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General														PREDEITY:1,Kelizandri	PRELEVEL:MIN=5																															DEFINE:TouchOfTheBrackishEmperorUses|0																		DESC:Your touch can suppress spells that aid in breathing water.																																BONUS:VAR|TouchOfTheBrackishEmperorUses|1+((TL-5)/5)				SOURCEPAGE:p.59														BENEFIT:%1 times per day while underwater, you can touch a creature in order to suppress any spells that allow the creature to breathe underwater (air bubble, life bubble, water breathing, and so on) for 5 minutes. Suppressing the spells requires you to roll 1d20 + %2; the DC for each spell is 11 + the spell's caster level (if the spells affecting the creature have differing caster levels, you might dispel some but not the others) This is a spell-like ability.|TL|TouchOfTheBrackishEmperorUses

Child of Two Worlds									CATEGORY:FEAT			TYPE:Story		PRELEVEL:MAX=1	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Whether through an elixir of two worlds (Aquatic Adventures page 62) or other means, one of your parents was aquatic and the other was a land-dweller. You are mostly a normal member of your race, except as stated in this feat. You must select this feat at 1st level, and you can't have other feats, traits, or abilities that specify your bloodline such as Racial HeritageAPG. Thematically appropriate backgrounds include Adopted Outside Your Race, Bastard Born, Death in the Family, One of a Kind, and The Relative. These backgrounds are found in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.57
CATEGORY=FEAT|Child of Two Worlds.MOD																																																																																																																						DESC:[Not Implemented] You are the child of a land-dwelling creature and an aquatic creature, struggling to reconcile your dual heritage.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Child of Two Worlds.MOD																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				BENEFIT:You gain a land speed of 10 feet if you are aquatic; if you aren't aquatic, you gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks that doesn't stack with the bonus for having a swim speed. Goal: You must live among your other parent's race (the aquatic parent if you are a land-dweller or the land-dwelling parent if you are aquatic), learning to adapt to their strange world and culture until others of that race truly accept you. It isn't enough to simply find a member of the appropriate race and badger or sweet-talk them until they agree to accept you; you must perform significant rites of passage and form real bonds with members of your other parent's race. Completion Benefit: You gain the amphibious subtype (and the aquatic subtype, if you don't have it) and can breathe both water and air with equal ease. As a swift action, you can transform your feet into a tail fin (gaining a swim speed of 40 feet) or your tail fin into feet (gaining a land speed of 30 feet), changing back and forth as often as you wish.
