False Casting		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Magical Aptitude],[PRESKILL:2,Bluff=1,Sleight of Hand=1]				DESC:When using a magic item, you can trick onlookers into thinking you used spellcasting instead.			SOURCEPAGE:p.10	BENEFIT:When you use a magic item or a spell-like ability to create a magical effect, you may add additional magic-seeming words and hand gestures to trick onlookers into believing you cast the spell yourself. If using an item that is recognizable as a magical implement (such as a wand or ring), you can trick viewers into thinking you are just using the item as a focus component. Onlookers who have no ranks in Spellcraft have no knowledge of what is genuine spellcasting, and automatically believe you are casting a spell.&nl;If an onlooker attempts a Spellcraft check to identify your "casting," his check is opposed by your Bluff check. If he succeeds, he realizes the deception. If he fails, he believes you cast the spell. Regardless of the result of that opposed check, he uses the result of that Spellcraft check to identify the "spell" you cast, except the DC is 20 + the spell's level instead of 15 + the spell's level.
False Focus			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PREMULT:2,[PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Religion)=1],[PRESPELLCAST:TYPE=Arcane]							DESC:You can use a divine focus to cast arcane spells.										SOURCEPAGE:p.10	BENEFIT:By using a divine focus as part of casting, you can cast any spell with a material component costing the value of that divine focus (maximum 100 gp) or less without needing that component. For example, if you use a silver holy symbol worth 25 gp, you do not have to provide material components for an arcane spell if its components are worth 25 gp or less. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than the value of the divine focus, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal. &nl;Normal: A divine focus has no effect when used as a component in arcane spells.
Shadow Gambit		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (Illusion)],[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5]					DESC:You can tap into the Plane of Shadow to momentarily lend reality to one of your illusion (figment) spells.	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can draw upon energies from the Plane of Shadow to cause an ongoing figment spell you cast to damage a foe as if the illusion were real. The illusion must be one you retain ongoing control of, such as minor image, and the target must be both visible to you and within or adjacent to the area of your illusion. Using this feat immediately ends the figment's duration. &nl;You must either make a melee touch attack or give the target a saving throw (Fortitude or Reflex) to resist the damage (see below). If you choose a melee touch attack, you use your own melee touch attack bonus, and if you miss, the spell deals no damage. If you choose to allow the target a saving throw, a successful save means it takes half damage. The shadowy attack deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level. If the target disbelieves or sees through the illusion, reduce the damage by half. The shadowy attack can deal acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing damage, but the damage must be appropriate to the illusion. For example, an illusory wall that collapses deals bludgeoning damage with a Fortitude save for half, an illusory swordsman strikes with a melee touch attack deals slashing damage, and an illusory wall of fire deals fire damage with a Reflex save for half.
Shadow Grasp		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Tenebrous Spell,Umbral Spell																				DESC:Your darkness spells have substance and bind your foes.									SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you cast a spell with the darkness descriptor that affects an area, creatures in the area are entangled. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the entangle effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save, a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell's DC if it had a saving throw) to negate the effect. If the spell allows spell resistance, failing to overcome a creature's spell resistance means it is not entangled. &nl;An entangled creature remains so as long as it is in the area of the spell and for 1 round after it leaves. A creature that leaves and reenters the area must make a new saving throw to avoid becoming entangled. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being entangled do not have to make additional saves if they stay within the darkened area. &nl;You are never impeded by the effects of your spells modified by this feat. A Shadow Grasp spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Tenebrous Spell		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																															DESC:You blend shadow into your spells, increasing their efficacy at the price of susceptibility to light.		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you cast a tenebrous spell in darkness or dim light, the spell's effective caster level and any associated save DCs are increased by 1. Any attempts at dispelling a tenebrous spell in darkness or dim light take a -2 penalty on the dispel check. &amp;nlCasting a tenebrous spell in bright light is difficult, and requires a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the tenebrous spell's effective spell level). Attempts to dispel a tenebrous spell in bright light gain a +4 bonus on the dispel check. &amp;nlYou cannot use this feat on spells with the light descriptor. A tenebrous spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level, except in the case of spells with the darkness or shadow descriptor or of the illusion (shadow) subschool; this feat does not change the effective level of those spells (but still counts as using a metamagic feat for all other purposes).
Umbral Spell		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Tenebrous Spell																						DESC:Targets of your darkness spells radiate darkness.										SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:An umbral spell gains the darkness descriptor. As long as the spell is in effect, the creature or object affected radiates darkness in a 10-foot radius, reducing illumination similar to the effects of the darkness spell. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light level in this area. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected by an umbral spell if they are of a higher level than the umbral spell's unmodified spell level. This effect does not stack with itself or with any other effect that creates darkness. An umbral spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. &nl;You cannot use this feat on a spell with an instantaneous duration or a spell that does not target a creature or object.
Inscribe Magical Tattoo	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:ItemCreation											PREMULT:2,[PRESKILL:1,Craft (Calligraphy)=5,Craft (Paintings)=5,Craft (Tattoos)=5],[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5]	DESC:You can craft magical tattoos.														SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:You can create magical tattoos, magic items inked directly into the flesh of a willing or helpless creature. Both you and the recipient of the tattoo (if the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process. Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots. &nl;Magical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of dispel magic. The spell erase can permanently destroy a magical tattoo, but the bearer of the tattoo can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to erase the tattoo. Physically removing a magical tattoo with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or helpless, but also provokes attacks of opportunity. At least 2 points of damage per caster level of the tattoo must be dealt to destroy a magical tattoo in this manner. &nl;Magical tattoos follow the rules for magic item creation as though they were wondrous items, except that they can use the Craft (calligraphy, paintings, tattoos) skill. New magical tattoos can be researched and designed using the guidelines for pricing new magic items. Magical tattoos are treated as slotless magical items for pricing purposes.
