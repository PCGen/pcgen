It can be removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the curse's level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event--an event triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade.

Scathing Tirade					KEY:Chelish Diva ~ Scathing Tirade						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.BardDirgeOfDoom																																																																			DESCISPI:YES	DESC:A Chelish diva can use her performance to verbally lash out at another creature, causing it to become frightened unless it succeeds on a Will save (DC %1). To be affected, the target enemy must be within 30 feet and be able to see and hear the diva's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the diva continues her performance, plus 1d4 rounds.&nl; Although the diva can only direct the effect at one creature at a time, its effects persist for as long as she continues the performance, even if directed at a different creature. For example, she could direct her tirade at an innkeeper, who becomes frightened, then focus her wrath on the captain of the guard, and the innkeeper remains frightened for 1d4 more rounds even though her attention is no longer directed at him.&nl; This performance cannot cause a creature to become panicked, even if the target is already frightened from another effect. Scathing tirade is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible and visual components.|10+BardLVL/2+CHA																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.33

Battle Dance			KEY:Dawnflower Dervish ~ Battle Dance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality																								DESCISPI:YES	DESC:A Dawnflower dervish is trained in the use of the Perform skill, especially dance, to create magical effects on himself. This works like bardic performance, except that the Dawnflower dervish's performances grant double their normal bonuses, but these bonuses only affect him. He does not need to be able to see or hear his own performance. Battle dancing is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, and effects that affect bardic performance, except that battle dancing does not benefit from the Lingering Performance feat or any other ability that allows a bardic performance to grant bonuses after it has ended. The benefits of battle dancing apply only when the bard is wearing light or no armor. Like bardic performance, battle dancing cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities. Starting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires the Dawnflower dervish to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move action. Like a bard, a Dawnflower dervish's performance ends immediately if he is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round. A Dawnflower dervish cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a Dawnflower dervish can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action. When the Dawnflower dervish uses the inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics bardic performance types as battle dances, these performance types only provide benef it to the Dawnflower dervish himself. All other types of bardic performance work normally (affecting the bard and his allies, or the bard's enemies, as appropriate). This ability alters the standard bardic performance ability.																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.34

By spending a move action focusing on his whirling, the dervish can apply the Quicken Spell feat to any cure spell he is about to cast (effectively spending a move action and swift action to cast the spell).

Her sorcerer levels stack with any wizard or witch levels she possesses when determining the powers of her familiar--this ability does not allow her to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Unlike most familiars, her familiar can transform itself into a tattoo that she carries in her flesh. Transforming into a tattoo or back to normal familiar form is a move action for her familiar. In tattoo form, the familiar looks like a stylized version of itself, but does not count as a creature separate from the tattooed sorcerer. In tattoo form it continues to grant its special familiar ability, but otherwise has no abilities and can take no actions except to transform from tattoo into creature. A familiar tattoo cannot be erased or dispelled. This ability replaces the 1st-level bloodline power.

To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell's effects take place, she makes a concentration check (DC 20 + double the spell's level). If she fails this check, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its actual effects are replaced by a CR %1 primal magic event and she is staggered for 1 round per level of the spell she was attempting to cast. If she makes this check, she casts the spell normally and it is not expended from her prepared spell slot, allowing her to cast that spell again at a later point.&nl; You may use primal magic in this manner %2 per day.|CASTERLEVEL|PrimalMagicTimes																																														BONUS:VAR|PrimalMagicTimes|1+WizardLVL/5			SOURCEPAGE:p.38	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|Channel primal magic as a swift action (concentration DC 20 + double spell level)	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|PrimalMagicTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per day
Enhance Primal Magic Event							KEY:Primalist ~ Enhance Primal Magic Event	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WizardBonusFeat5																																																																				DESC:When a primalist triggers a primal magic event, as a swift action she can increase or decrease its CR by 1. If she makes a concentration check (DC 15 + the primal magic event's CR), she can instead increase or decrease the CR by 2. If she reduces a primal magic event's CR to less than 1, the event is negated. She can choose to use this ability after she determines what primal magic event she triggers, but before she resolves the effects of that event.																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Primal Surge									KEY:Primalist ~ Primal Surge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WizardBonusFeat10																																																																				DESC:Whenever a primalist triggers a primal magic event, she rolls the percentile dice twice to determine to event that occurs and chooses which one of the two possible events occurs. She becomes resistant to the effects of primal magic events. Anytime an event would affect her, the GM rolls 1d20 + the event's CR against DC %1. If this roll fails, the event does not affect her, similar to a creature with spell resistance ignoring magical effects with an SR check. If the primal magic event is duplicating the effects of a spell that does not allow spell resistance (such as create pit), this resistance does not apply.|11+WizardLVL																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.38

Shadow Spells									KEY:Shadowcaster ~ Shadow Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WizardArcaneBond																																																																				DESC:A shadowcaster uses his shadow to prepare additional spells. He must spend his entire period of spell preparation in dim illumination to use this ability. He may prepare a number of additional spell levels of spells equal to the level of the highest-level wizard spell he can cast. For example, if he can cast 6th-level wizard spells, he could prepare six 1st-level spells, two 3rd-level spells, or any similar combination that adds up to a total of six spell levels. These spells are stored in his shadow. He can only cast these spells when he is in an area of normal light or dim light. He gains Shadowtongue as a bonus language.																																														AUTO:LANG|Shadowtongue																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.39

For example, shadow evocation and shadow conjuration deal 40%% normal damage on a successful save instead of 20%%.
