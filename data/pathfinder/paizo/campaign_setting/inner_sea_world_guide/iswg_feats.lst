MULT:YES	CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFICIENCY|TYPE=Crossbow|TYPE=Firearm																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:ISWG p.288																BENEFIT:The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow), a move action (for a heavy crossbow or one-handed firearm), or a standard action (for a two-handed firearm). Reloading a crossbow or firearm still provokes an attack of opportunity. If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
