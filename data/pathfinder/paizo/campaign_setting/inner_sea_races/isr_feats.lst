DESC:You're so loyal to your family or friends that you're willing to suffer for them.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.207	BENEFIT:Whenever an opponent makes a melee or ranged attack against one of your allies who is adjacent to you and who also has this feat, you can spend an immediate action to shield the ally with your own body. You become the target of the attack, and the opponent gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll. For the purpose of determining distance, cover and concealment, you count as being in your ally's square when the attack is resolved. If the attack misses you due to concealment, blink, or a similar effect, it instead targets your ally as if you had not used this feat's ability.

Your shapes occasionally appear to blend into each other, making it impossible to distinguish you and granting you and any affected allies a 20%% miss chance due to concealment. This is an illusion (figment) effect. Spells and effects that don't require an attack roll, such as area spells, affect you normally. An attacker must be able to see and reach both you and your ally to be fooled. If you're invisible or the attacker is blind, the feat has no effect. Because this feat relies on the fact that both you and your ally are blending together to create the visual illusion, it doesn't function with effects like the inquisitor's solo tactics class feature; both you and the ally must possess the feat. If you have more than one adjacent ally with this feat, this feat applies to all allies who qualify.

DESC:The concept of ownership is rather flexible among you and your friends.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.209	BENEFIT:Whenever you're within 30 feet of a halfling ally who also has this feat, as a move action you can draw an item in that ally's possession as if it were on your person. This is not a magical effect-you just conveniently happen to remember that you had borrowed that item earlier. The item must be something that easily fits in a pocket or sleeve, such as a dagger, potion, wand, or scroll. When you or an ally draw an item (whether or not you do so using Shared Ownership) or otherwise definitively establish who is holding the item, you can't use Shared Ownership to draw the item in this manner until you have had at least 1 hour to mingle with your companions.
