Air of Authority										TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Medium,Mesmerist=3|Psychic=5								SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer										COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Background,Taldan						SOURCEPAGE:p.218	DESC:You gain an unmistakable air of authority, which clouds creatures' minds and causes them to believe that you are their direct superior. Each creature with whom you attempt to leverage your newfound authority receives a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. Otherwise, it treats you as it would its direct superior. Creatures with different direct superiors see you in different ways, which can potentially lead to conflicts that allow additional saving throws (for instance, if a cook sees you as the head chef, he might be quite perplexed to see the vizier treating you as if you were the king).
Bleaching Resistance									TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Alchemist,Spiritualist=4|Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6				SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You												DURATION:24 hours																												PRERACE:1,Gnome%		SOURCEPAGE:p.218	DESC:Ability score drain from the Bleaching doesn't affect your ability score modifiers while you're affected by this spell. This spell does not remove the Bleaching's effect on your appearance, nor does it prevent you from suffering further ability penalties, dying, or becoming a bleachling as a result of the Bleaching.

Creatures (and foliage) in the area take %1d8 points of fire damage unless they are outsiders with the chaotic and evil subtypes or are otherwise tainted by demons, in which case they instead take %2d6 points of fire damage. This fire damage ignores the fire resistance granted by the demon subtype, but it does not penetrate any other form of fire resistance or immunity.|min(7,CASTERLEVEL/2)|min(15,CASTERLEVEL)
Carve Passage										TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=5									SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Earth						COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:Dirt or loose rock in (CASTERLEVEL) five-ft. cubes				DURATION:Instantaneous									SAVEINFO:See text				SPELLRES:No											PRERACE:1,Kobold		SOURCEPAGE:p.218	DESC:You can excavate and move an amount of snow, earth, dust, sand, and loose or packed rocks or ice chunks (each no more than 5 feet in diameter) whose volume fills %1 five-foot cubes.

The two creatures must be willing in order for the spell to work. After you cast this spell, any creature attempting to aid or hinder either of the two targets in any way must succeed at a Will save or lose its action instead (spell resistance applies). A creature that fails its Will save against champion's bout cannot attempt to interfere again. If a creature successfully interferes with the bout, the spell ends immediately.
Damnation of Memory									TYPE:Arcane.Psychic		CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist=6|Psychic=9									SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Long				TARGETAREA:All living creatures within range							DURATION:Permanent									SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Background,Garundi						SOURCEPAGE:p.218	DESC:You name one creature and excise all memory of that creature's involvement in events the targets remember. The targets either forget who exactly performed the named creature's deeds or assume some other individual performed them. Alternatively, you can name either one event lasting no more than %1 minutes or a single topic (defined at the GM's discretion) such as a shameful secret of the king that was recently revealed or a small revolt that was quelled messily, and erase all recollection of that subject from the minds of all creatures within the area.

The flames cast light as a torch. Any creature that attacks you with a non-reach melee weapon or that begins its turn engaged in a grapple with you takes 1d6 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. The creature can negate the damage (and avoid catching fire) with spell resistance.

No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.

In addition to its normal abilities, the crow gains the Improved Steal feat as a bonus feat and gains an eye rake attack. If both of its claw attacks hit the same living foe in a single round, that foe must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be blinded as the bird scratches and tears at the foe's eyes.

A creature that begins its turn in the wall is ejected in the direction of the current just before it acts. The wall provides cover against attacks from out of the water, as usual for a body of water. The water and the currents deflect physical ranged attacks into or through the wall, unless a weapon used is exceptionally massive (such as a siege engine). A creature submerged in the wall takes the usual penalties for underwater combat. The wall blocks gases and liquids and prevents water from mixing at its edges.
