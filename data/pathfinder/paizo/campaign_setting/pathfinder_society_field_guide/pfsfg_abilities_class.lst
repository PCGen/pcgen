# Scroll Scholar (Cleric or Wizard) #
#####################################
# p.26  A scroll scholar values knowledge and learning as much as her other abilities, trading a portion of her potential in her chosen class for
#       greater breadth of skill at deciphering old texts, piecing together strange fragments of esoteric lore, and deciphering the hidden qualities
#       of strange and unusual magical items. The scroll scholar archetype can be taken by either clerics or wizards they give up different class
#       abilities for the new abilities granted by this archetype. A wizard must either be a universalist wizard or a diviner wizard in order to take
#       this archetype other types of school specializations are not suited to this archetype's focus. A scroll scholar has the following class features.
# p.26  Diligent Student (Ex): At 1st level, a scroll scholar chooses one Knowledge skill. This becomes a class skill if it is not already one.
#       The scroll scholar adds half her class level to all Knowledge checks of this type (minimum 1). At 5th level and every five levels thereafter,
#       a scroll scholar chooses 1 additional Knowledge skill to receive this bonus. For clerics, this ability replaces one of the 1st-level granted
#       powers from her domains-the character gets to choose which of her two 1st-level granted powers it replaces. For wizards, this ability replaces
#       diviner's fortune (if a diviner) or hand of the apprentice (if a universalist).
# p.26  Secrets Revealed (Sp): At 5th level, a scroll scholar gains the ability to cast comprehend languages and identify as spelllike abilities.
#       Her caster level is equal to her character level in whatever class she took the scroll scholar archetype for. She can cast these spells
#       once per day each at 5th level, twice per day each at 7th level, and three times per day each at 9th level. At 11th level, one of these
#       spell-like abilities (scholar's choice) becomes a constant spell-like ability, and at 13th level, the second one becomes a constant spell-like
#       ability. If the scholar is a cleric, this ability replaces the increase to her channel energy damage normally gained at 5th level   her channel
#       energy damage increases to 3d6 at 7th level instead, and for the rest of her career as a cleric lags 1d6 behind normal. If the scholar is a
#       wizard, this ability replaces her bonus feat for 5th level.
# p.27  Flash of Insight (Su): At 10th level, once per day, a scroll scholar can gain a +5 bonus on a single attack roll, caster level check, or
#       saving throw as an immediate action. This decision must be made before the results of the roll are known, but can be made after the die is
#       rolled. This ability can be used twice per day at 15th level, and 3 times per day at 20th level. This ability replaces the normal addition of
#       a new 4th-level spell slot to the character's spells per day   from this point on, the cleric or wizard has one fewer 4th level spell slot than
#       other clerics or wizards.

# Scroll Scoundrel (Rogue) #
############################
# p.27  The scroll scoundrel is a rogue archetype that relies on cunning and quick wits to stay alive. He excels in exploiting overconfidence
#       and predictability, using knowledge he's gained from his extensive research and field experience combined with hearsay and recent
#       observations to react to problems as soon as they arise with swift but unnaturally accurate guesswork. A scroll scoundrel is often
#       called upon by the Pathfinders to undertake missions where killing a foe isn't nearly as important as humiliating them in public duels
#       or similar conf licts. A scroll scoundrel has the following class features.
# p.27  Fast Talker (Ex): At 2nd level, a scroll scoundrel's penalty on Bluff checks that are unlikely, farfetched, or impossible to achieve is
#       reduced by 5. When he makes a Diplomacy check to adjust a creature's starting attitude, he gains a +3 competence bonus on the skill
#       check. This ability replaces the rogue's 2nd-level rogue talent.
# p.27  Adaptive Learning (Ex): At 3rd level, a scroll scoundrel gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against abilities and spells he has already
#       successfully saved against within the past minute (even if the spells or abilities in question were used by different creatures). This
#       bonus increases by +1 when the scroll scoundrel reaches 6th level, and by an additional +1 for every three levels thereafter, to a
#       maximum of +6 at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.
# p.27  Pay It Back (Ex): At 4th level, a scroll scoundrel receives a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against foes who made
#       melee attacks against him in the previous round. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
# p.27  Elusive Gambit (Ex): At 6th level, a scroll scoundrel's movement can leave a foe off-balance. If a scroll scoundrel provokes an attack
#       of opportunity by moving past an opponent and that opponent then misses with the attack, that foe is considered to be flat-footed against
#       the scroll scoundrel's next melee attack, provided that melee attack comes within 1 round of the missed attack of opportunity. This ability
#       replaces improved uncanny dodge.
# p.27  Spot Weakness (Ex): At 10th level, a scroll scoundrel can discover a weakness in his enemy's defenses as a swift action. His next successful
#       hit in the same round ignores 5 points of the foe's damage reduction or hardness. At 15th level, he ignores the first 10 points, and at 20th
#       level, the first 15 points. If the attack deals any sneak attack damage, he ignores all of the foe's damage reduction or hardness for that
#       attack. He cannot use this ability on foes that are immune to critical hits. This ability replaces the scroll scoundrel's 10th-level rogue talent.

# Dimensional Occultist (Witch) #
#################################
# p.28  While dimensional occultist witches are not all associated with the Pathfinders, enough of them are to warrant mention here. A dimensional
#       occultist sacrifices some of her mastery over hexes in return for increased planar lore  she spends much of her time researching and
#       communing with otherplanar spirits, often through her familiar or via the study of ancient texts, and has an increased mastery over
#       various conjurations and other extraplanar effects. She can even travel between dimensions as she gains power. A dimensional occultist has
#       the following class features.
#       Patron: A dimensional occultist witch does not have the same freedom of choice among her patrons as do other witches she must select the
#       Dimensions patron when she gains this archetype. The Dimensions patron provides the following bonus spells: 2nd hold portal, 4th rope trick,
#       6th blink, 8th dimensional anchor, 10th lesser planar binding, 12th planar binding, 14th banishment, 16th  greater planar binding, 18th gate.
# p.28  Dimensional Augmentation (Su): At 2nd level, a dimensional occultist can augment her spells by incorporating complex mathematical equations
#       and formulae into the casting, typically by inscribing these equations with chalk or charcoal onto a solid surface (although scribing them
#       on paper or into wet sand works fine as well). Augmenting a spell in this way adds both a somatic component (the actual scribing of the
#       equations) and a material component (the writing stylus and ink, chalk, charcoal, or other medium) to the spell, and increases its casting
#       time to a number of rounds equal to the spell's level (if the spell's casting time is already 1 minute or more, the casting time is not altered).
#       As a result, using dimensional augmentation to cast a spell isn't a good option in the heat of combat. Augmenting a spell in this manner
#       increases its effective caster level by +1. A dimensional occultist can augment her spells in this manner once per day at 2nd level, plus
#       one additional time per day for every even-numbered witch level she gains. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 2nd level.
# p.28  Commune with Familiar (Sp): At 8th level, a dimensional occultist can use her familiar as a link between herself and strange, otherworldly
#       intelligences on other planes. Once per week, she may use this link to cast contact other plane as a spell-like ability, at a caster level
#       equal to her witch level. The entity contacted replies to the witch via her familiar (which speaks in a strange disembodied voice), via
#       telepathic contact, or by some similarly disconcerting method of communication. When a witch uses this method to contact other planes, she
#       gains a +4 bonus on the Intelligence check to avoid the decrease to Intelligence and Charisma. If she still fails the save, the
#       Intelligence/Charisma decrease lasts only 24 hours rather than a number of weeks. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 8th level.
# p.28  Dimensional Waypoints (Ex): At 12th level, a dimensional occultist can create a dimensional waypoint by spending 2d4 minutes inscribing a
#       number of equations on a solid surface (such as a wall, tree, stone floor, or structure) with a writing instrument. The exact configuration
#       of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so
#       without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is
#       precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even
#       that of the surface upon which it was inscribed it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th
#       level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a
#       waypoint she's already set by simply using that waypoint's unique equation at a new site. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at

A dimensional occultist sacrifices some of her mastery over hexes in return for increased planar lore  she spends much of her time researching and communing with otherplanar spirits, often through her familiar or via the study of ancient texts, and has an increased mastery over various conjurations and other extraplanar effects. She can even travel between dimensions as she gains power. A dimensional occultist has the following class features. Patron: A dimensional occultist witch does not have the same freedom of choice among her patrons as do other witches she must select the Dimensions patron when she gains this archetype. The Dimensions patron provides the following bonus spells: 2nd hold portal, 4th rope trick, 6th blink, 8th dimensional anchor, 10th lesser planar binding, 12th planar binding, 14th banishment, 16th greater planar binding, 18th gate.

Dimensional Augmentation	KEY:Dimensional Occultist ~ Dimensional Augmentation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																									DESC:At 2nd level, a dimensional occultist can augment her spells by incorporating complex mathematical equations and formulae into the casting, typically by inscribing these equations with chalk or charcoal onto a solid surface (although scribing them on paper or into wet sand works fine as well). Augmenting a spell in this way adds both a somatic component (the actual scribing of the equations) and a material component (the writing stylus and ink, chalk, charcoal, or other medium) to the spell, and increases its casting time to a number of rounds equal to the spell's level (if the spell's casting time is already 1 minute or more, the casting time is not altered). As a result, using dimensional augmentation to cast a spell isn't a good option in the heat of combat. Augmenting a spell in this manner increases its effective caster level by +1. A dimensional occultist can augment her spells in this manner once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every even-numbered witch level she gains. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 2nd level.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Commune with Familiar		KEY:Dimensional Occultist ~ Commune with Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																											DESC:At 8th level, a dimensional occultist can use her familiar as a link between herself and strange, otherworldly intelligences on other planes. Once per week, she may use this link to cast contact other plane as a spell-like ability, at a caster level equal to her witch level. The entity contacted replies to the witch via her familiar (which speaks in a strange disembodied voice), via telepathic contact, or by some similarly disconcerting method of communication. When a witch uses this method to contact other planes, she gains a +4 bonus on the Intelligence check to avoid the decrease to Intelligence and Charisma. If she still fails the save, the Intelligence/Charisma decrease lasts only 24 hours rather than a number of weeks. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 8th level.																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Dimensional Waypoints		KEY:Dimensional Occultist ~ Dimensional Waypoints	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																									DESC:At 12th level, a dimensional occultist can create a dimensional waypoint by spending 2d4 minutes inscribing a number of equations on a solid surface (such as a wall, tree, stone floor, or structure) with a writing instrument. The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was inscribed it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a waypoint she's already set by simply using that waypoint's unique equation at a new site. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 12th level.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.28

# Seeker (Oracle or Sorcerer) #
###############################
# p.29  Oracles and sorcerers gain their magical powers through strange and mysterious ways, be they chosen by fate or blood. While most might be
#       content with their strange powers, some oracles and sorcerers join the Pathfinders specifically to find out more about their mysteries and
#       bloodlines and determine the genesis and history of their eldritch talents. These spellcasters are known among the Spells as seekers, after
#       their obsession with researching ancient texts and obscure ruins for any clues they can find about their heritage and histories. A seeker
#       has the following class features.
# p.29  Tinkering (Ex): Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries
#       or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains
#       Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to
#       locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also
#       possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for
#       determining his overall bonus on these skill checks. For an oracle, this ability replaces all of the bonus class skills he would otherwise
#       normally gain from his mystery. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces his bonus Eschew Materials feat.
# p.29  Seeker Lore (Ex): By 3rd level, a seeker has already learned much about his mystery or bloodline, and is more comfortable using the bonus
#       spells gained by that mystery or bloodline. He gains a +4 bonus on all concentration checks, on caster level checks made to overcome spell
#       resistance, and on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks made on topics associated with his bonus spells. For an oracle, this ability
#       replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 3rd level.
# p.29  Seeker Magic (Su): At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his mystery or bloodline spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies
#       a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his mystery or his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat's spell level adjustment by 1.
#       Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only
#       increases the spell's effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not
#       stack with similar reductions from other abilities. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 15th level. For a sorcerer,
#       this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 15th level.

# p.30  Grenadiers train to exercise their talents in the thick of battle, even when not under the inf luence of their mutagens. They learn methods
#       of combining weapon attacks with their alchemical magic, and sacrifice skill with poisons in order to become more adept at using alchemical
#       bombs or using alchemical items in conjunction with their martial skills. As an unusual side effect of their skill at handling bombs and
#       alchemical items with increased speed, grenadiers master the ability to drink potions, elixirs, and mutagens quickly and safely, without
#       exposing themselves to peril while doing so. A grenadier has the following class features.
# p.30  Martial Weapon Proficiency: At 1st level, a grenadier picks one martial weapon to become proficient in the use of. This ability replaces Brew Potion.
# p.30  Alchemical Weapon (Su): At 2nd level, a grenadier can infuse a weapon or piece of ammunition with a single harmful alchemical liquid or powder,
#       such as alchemist's fire or sneezing powder, as a move action. This action consumes the alchemical item, but transfers its effect to the weapon
#       in question. The alchemical item takes full effect on the next creature struck by the weapon, but does not splash, spread, or otherwise affect
#       additional targets. Any extra damage added is treated like bonus dice of damage, and is not doubled on a critical hit. The alchemical treatment
#       causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off 1 minute after application if no blow is struck. At 6th level, a grenadier can use her
#       alchemical weapon ability as a swift action. At 15th level, this ability becomes a free action. This ability replaces poison resistance.
# p.30  Precise Bombs (Ex): At 2nd level, a grenadier gains the precise bombs alchemist discovery as a bonus discovery. This ability replaces poison use.
# p.30  Directed Blast (Su): At 6th level, a grenadier can detonate a bomb so that it splashes in a 20-foot cone rather than affecting a radius. The cone
#       starts at the alchemist and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by
#       the cone to be the target of the bomb and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone take splash damage. If the
#       alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead of 20 feet.
#       This ability replaces swift poisoning.
# p.30  Staggering Blast (Su): At 10th level, a grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier scores a
#       successful critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC
#       equals the bomb's Ref lex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb's
#       staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional hits from a staggering blast add to the effect's overall
#       duration. This ability replaces poison immunity.

# p.31  Quick thinking and deception can often carry the day where raw force might not. Lore wardens are the bodyguards, guardians, and soldiers of
#       the Pathfinder Society. Not only are they often called upon to protect and watch over important repositories of lore, but they themselves
#       are impressive keepers of all manner of knowledge. Lore wardens are fighters who benefit from learning to outsmart and outmaneuver their foes
#       rather than just overpower them. Even out of combat, lore wardens have a quick wit and a surprising breadth of knowledge that can often grant
#       them significant advantages over enemies even before a battle begins. Indeed, for many lore wardens, a fight that can be won without a single
#       weapon being drawn is the best kind of victory. A lore warden has the following class features.
# p.31  Scholastic (Ex): Lore wardens gain 2 additional skill ranks each level. These ranks must be spent on Intelligence-based skills. All Intelligence
#       -based skills are class skills for lore wardens. This ability replaces the lore warden's proficiency with medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.
# p.31  Expertise (Ex): At 2nd level, a lore warden gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if he would not normally qualify for this feat. This
#       ability replaces bravery 1.
# p.31  Maneuver Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, a lore warden gains a +2 bonus on all CMB checks and to his CMD. This bonus increases to +4 at 7th level,
#       +6 at 11th level, and +8 at 15th level. This ability replaces armor training 1.
# p.31  Know Thy Enemy (Ex): At 7th level, a lore warden can take a standard action to study a specific target in sight. He must make a Knowledge check
#       to determine the target's abilities and weaknesses as part of this standard action. If successful, the lore warden not only notes the appropriate
#       abilities and weaknesses, as detailed under the Knowledge skill on page 100 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, but also gains a +2 competence
#       bonus on all attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made against that enemy. Note that this bonus on attack and damage rolls applies only to that
#       specific creature. This bonus lasts for the duration of an encounter, or until the lore warden attempts a new Knowledge check to use this ability
#       on a different target. This ability replaces armor training 2.
# p.31  Hair's Breadth (Ex): At 11th level, a lore warden can attempt an Acrobatics check as an immediate action to negate a confirmation role for a
#       critical hit. The critical hit confirmation is negated (though the attack still hits and deals normal damage) if the Acrobatics check is greater
#       than the opponent's confirmation roll. This ability replaces armor training 3.
