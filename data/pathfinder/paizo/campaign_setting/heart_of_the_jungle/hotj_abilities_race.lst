Infestation		KEY:Giant Botfly ~ Infestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DEFINE:GiantBotflyInfestationDC|0	DESC:Upon each successful sting attack, the giant botfly implants an egg in the victim subcutaneously. Each implanted egg reacts to the warmth of the victim's body, triggering its hatching. One day later, the egg releases a pupa that devours the host's flesh as it develops, growing to the size of a small mouse, at which point it reaches its larval stage. If left untreated, the larva continues to develop until it kills the host or 1 week has passed, at which point it burrows out of the body and drops to the ground, where it transforms into an adult giant botfly. Individual larvae may be squeezed or cut out of the host with a DC 10 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts 1d4 points of damage whether or not it's successful. A Cure Disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm to the host. Giant botfly larvae: Infestation; Fort DC %1; Onset 1 day; Frequency 1/day for 1 week; Effect 1 Con damage per larva.|GiantBotflyInfestationDC	BONUS:VAR|GiantBotflyInfestationDC|10+(HD/2)+CON|TYPE=Base	SOURCEPAGE:p.59

The larvae may be cut out of the host with a DC 15 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts 1d8 points of damage whether or not it's successful. A Cure Disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm to the host. Botfly larvae: Infestation; Fort DC %1; Onset 1 day; Frequency 1/day; Effect 1d4 Con damage.|BotflySwarmInfestationDC																																																																																	BONUS:VAR|BotflySwarmInfestationDC|10+(HD/2)+CON|TYPE=Base	SOURCEPAGE:p.59

###Block: Togongo Treant Abilities
# Ability Name			Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type								Define					Description																																																																																																																																																																																	Modify VAR								Source Page
Animate Trees			KEY:Tobongo ~ Animate Trees		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike										DESC:A tobongo can animate any trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a standard treant (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant's animation and rockthrowing abilities). If the tobongo that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Curse of Barkflesh		KEY:Tobongo ~ Curse of Barkflesh	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			DEFINE:TobongoCurseOfBarkfleshDC|0	DESC:Following a successful grapple, a tobongo can dig its spiky branches into its victim, infecting him with a foul and potent curse. Unless he succeeds at a DC %1 Fortitude save, the victim's flesh immediately begins to harden and grow uncontrollably like tree bark, and he takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage per day until his Dexterity reaches 0. At this point, the victim turns entirely stiff, grows roots, and transforms into a new, unintelligent tree, preventing any form of resurrection short of Wish or Miracle. The effect can be slowed by pruning the victim once per hour, slicing off the strange growths. Pruning inflicts 1d6 points of damage on the victim, but it negates the need to make a new Fortitude save. If the victim goes without pruning for more than an hour, the barkflesh takes over and he must immediately make the Fortitude save for the day or suffer the Dexterity damage. Curse of Barkflesh: Grapple - Injury; Fort DC 20; Frequency 1/day; Effect 1d4 Dex damage, when Dex reaches 0, target transforms into a tree.|TobongoCurseOfBarkfleshDC	BONUS:VAR|TobongoCurseOfBarkfleshDC|10+(HD/2)+WIS	SOURCEPAGE:p.61

Living creatures within the radius must make a DC %1 Reflex save or fall prone and take 1d6 points of damage. Man-made structures within the area of effect must make a DC %1 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of structural damage. Once uprooted, the tobongo cannot use this action again until it re-roots itself. It takes the creature at least 1 hour to root effectively.|TobongoShakeTheEarthDC																																																																																													BONUS:VAR|TobongoShakeTheEarthDC|10+(HD/2)+STR		SOURCEPAGE:P.61
