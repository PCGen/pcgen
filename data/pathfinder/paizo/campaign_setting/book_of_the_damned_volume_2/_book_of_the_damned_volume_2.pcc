DESC:Gaze into the Abyss! Spawned from the darkest depths of the Abyss, the howling hordes of demonkind rise up to destroy and devour all of existence, their slavering, fiendish forms built to rend, enslave, and beguile. Whether in their horrid domains of madness in the Outer Rifts, or called forth into the material world by insane spellcasters, demons represent the fundamental immorality of the universe, evolving from sinful souls into entities both wretched and godlike, united under their vile taskmasters toward a single goal: to destroy all that mortal life holds dear.
