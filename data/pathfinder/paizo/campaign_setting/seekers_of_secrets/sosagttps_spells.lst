Questing Stone	CLASSES:Bard=4|Sorcerer,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Divination		TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, F											CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Touch and unlimited	TARGETAREA:One ioun stone touched					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell functions like arcane eye, except that it uses an ioun stone as a visible scrying sensor. The ioun stone moves at the same rate as an arcane eye, and may pass through holes or spaces  as small as 2 inches in diameter. It can enter another plane of existence using a gate or similar portal, but the caster loses contact with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced ioun stone has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone does not provide you with its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying sensor.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.17

Your insight is ineffable; you are unable to communicate your understanding to others. At the GM's option, this spell may instead give you a clue or other piece of useful information. In this case you may communicate the clue to others and retain knowledge of it after the spell's duration has expired.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Scrivener's Chant	CLASSES:Bard=0|Cleric=0|Sorcerer,Wizard=0	SCHOOL:Transmutation	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M (fine sand and a vial of ink)						CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:5 ft.				TARGETAREA:One or more written objects				DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will (harmless, object)		SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the rate of one normal-sized page per minute. The Linguistics skill can be used to make a convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is written in the hand of the caster. You must concentrate upon the material being duplicated for the spell's duration and provide new blank pages as required. The scrivener's chant requires blank paper and a quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material components. This spell cannot duplicate magical writing (including spells and magical scrolls), though it can duplicate non-magical writing from a magical source.	SOURCEPAGE:p.17

The destination must be an open space, though it does not need to have a solid surface for the target to stand upon. The spell's area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or similar means).
