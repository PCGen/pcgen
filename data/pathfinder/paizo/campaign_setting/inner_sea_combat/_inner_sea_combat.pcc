DESC:From the brink of the Worldwound, where demonic hordes lay siege to the mortal realm, to the battlefields of Mendev and Nirmathas, where soldiers distinguish themselves as heroes of ideals, battle is a common part of life in the Inner Sea region. Whether practiced by virtuous crusaders, fierce gladiators, or daring scoundrels, skill with a blade and knowledge of when to use it can mean the difference between life and death. The secrets of battle might not be etched on altars or scribed in spellbooks, but they're just as diverse and powerful as any magic-and just as available for bold heroes to claim!
