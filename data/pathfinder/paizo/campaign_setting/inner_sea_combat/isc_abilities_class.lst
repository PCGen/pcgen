Over the centuries, the monastery has fallen under Qadiran control many times, and the original seven forms for which the monastery was named have been lost to history.

While the horselords don't command the same presence as a host of Lastwall cavalry, they can get to the battle in half the time and on a third of the rations.

A gun scavenger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gun scavenger spends 1 grit point to perform a change out, she can either perform the change out as a standard action instead of a full-round action, or perform the change out on a firearm that isn't broken.

This boon can take one of two forms: the seal-breaker can choose to form a bond with his weapon, or he can choose to animate an undead mount to ride. If a bonded weapon is selected, this ability works exactly like the antipaladin's fiendish boon ability. If the undead mount ability is selected, the sealbreaker gains the ability to reanimate any Large corpse (or a Medium corpse for Small seal-breakers) as his corpse mount. If no such corpse is present, the seal-breaker cannot summon his mount. The corpse animates as a quadruped of the same size that the seal-breaker can ride, regardless of the corpse's living form. This corpse mount functions as a druid's animal companion using the seal-breaker's level as his effective druid level. The mount has the same base statistics as a heavy horse, pony, boar, camel, or dog (based on its size) with the following changes: its type changes to undead, it has a good Will save and bad Fortitude and Reflex saves, it uses the base creature's Constitution score as its Charisma score (and likewise applies all level-based advancements to Charisma instead of Constitution), and it has an Intelligence score of at least 6.

At 15th level, the seal-breaker can activate this ability as a move action. At 19th level, he can activate this ability as a swift action.

Code of Conduct	KEY:Seal-Breaker ~ Code of Conduct		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Antipaladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:The seal-breaker is dedicated to releasing the Whispering Tyrant from his prison. If a sealbreaker willingly and altruistically commits a good act, he loses all class features except proficiencies.

A seal-breaker's code requires that he place the ultimate release of Tar-Baphon above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just (provided such actions don't interfere with his ultimate goal).

Order of the Beast															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.CavalierOrder.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:OrderChallengeBonus|0	DESC:A cavalier belonging to this order seeks only destruction and chaos. Cavaliers of the order of the beast revel in destruction, and go out of their way to cause as much mayhem and disorder as possible. While some celebrate war and a victory well fought, an order of the beast cavalier fights only to taste the blood of his dying foe. Members of this order are often insane, and may venerate Rovagug or the elder gods and Great Old Ones of the Dark Tapestry. There are no colleges or universities where an aspiring cavalier can learn the ways of the order of the beast; it is a corruption of the other cavalier orders, and its secrets are whispered in the dreams of unbalanced youths by dark beings and passed down in forbidden rituals. On Golarion, order of the beast cavaliers are most often found leading ore tribes on raids from within the Hold of Belkzen, commanding small bands of brigands or raiders in the Mana Wastes, or sowing chaos anywhere a destructive leader is welcomed or venerated, particularly in lands where the law holds little sway.

Havoc									KEY:Order of the Beast ~ Havoc				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:At 8th level, the cavalier's mount gains the trample monster special ability. If the cavalier's mount has trample from another source, damage from the mount's trample attack instead increases as though the mount were one size category larger (see Table 3-1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary); this does not alter the damage dealt by the mount's slam attack. A creature that attempts a Reflex saving throw to avoid damage from the mount's trample attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier.																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Unstoppable Ravager						KEY:Order of the Beast ~ Unstoppable Ravager		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavalier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:At 15th level, the cavalier becomes an unstoppable engine of destruction. If the cavalier's current hit points drop below o, he does not fall unconscious. Instead, he continues to act so long as his negative hit point total does not exceed the amount of damage he dealt to an enemy on a single melee attack during the last round. The cavalier receives no Constitution check to stabilize while using this ability, and automatically takes 1 point of damage each round. When his current negative hit points exceed his negative Constitution score, the amount of damage he must deal to continue to act is now equal to the difference between his current negative hit point total and his negative Constitution score. Additionally, the cavalier can no longer benefit from magical healing (save for a wish or miracle spell), and he immediately dies once he can no longer take an action due to this ability.

Order of the Guard															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CavalierClassFeatures.CavalierOrder.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:OrderChallengeBonus|0	DESC:A cavalier belonging to this order seeks only destruction and chaos. Cavaliers of the order of the beast revel in destruction, and go out of their way to cause as much mayhem and disorder as possible. While some celebrate war and a victory well fought, an order of the beast cavalier fights only to taste the blood of his dying foe. Members of this order are often insane, and may venerate Rovagug or the elder gods and Great Old Ones of the Dark Tapestry. There are no colleges or universities where an aspiring cavalier can learn the ways of the order of the beast; it is a corruption of the other cavalier orders, and its secrets are whispered in the dreams of unbalanced youths by dark beings and passed down in forbidden rituals. On Golarion, order of the beast cavaliers are most often found leading ore tribes on raids from within the Hold of Belkzen, commanding small bands of brigands or raiders in the Mana Wastes, or sowing chaos anywhere a destructive leader is welcomed or venerated, particularly in lands where the law holds little sway.
