Blood of the Martyr	TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=2|Inquisitor=3				SCHOOL:Necromancy																						COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One living creature		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:You cause the target to bleed from every orifice, and her organs and blood become suffused with positive energy. If the subject fails her Fortitude save, she takes %1d6 points of bleed damage when you cast this spell. Any creature that takes a full-round action to sup the blood of the bleeding subject heals a number of hit points equal to twice as many as the subject lost that round due to the bleed effect. The subject must be willing or helpless to sup her blood, which provokes attacks of opportunity. Only one creature can be healed in this way per round. The subject can lick her own wounds in this way to regain half as many hit points as she lost that round. If the bleeding effect is stopped or the spell's duration ends, the subject's blood no longer heals those who drink it, though in the latter case the subject continues to bleed until the bleeding is stopped via magical healing or a successful DC 15 Heal check.|min(4,(CASTERLEVEL/4))
Charitable Impulse	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting												COMPS:V,S,F/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One humanoid creature		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:An affected creature practices nonviolent combat behaviors according to the following list of priorities, beginning with the first priority. The subject continues to perform a priority until he can no longer fulfill its demands (at which point he moves to the next priority) or until the spell ends, whichever comes first. 1st Priority: Heal injured creatures within 30 feet. 2nd Priority: The subject gives his weapon away to the nearest creature within 30 feet. 3rd Priority: Cast beneficial spells and/or use beneficial magic items on creatures within 30 feet, starting with the closest creatures. 4th Priority: The subject gives away his non-worn possessions-the contents of a backpack or similar item count as one item each, as does the container itself-to creatures within 30 feet. 5th Priority: The subject gives away his remaining possessions to creatures within 30 feet. If the subject fulfills all five priorities, the spell effect ends. The subject cannot attack or take attacks of opportunity, but can defend himself as normal. If the subject is attacked, the spell's effect immediately ends.
Elemental Assessor	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Acid|Cold|Electricity|Fire										COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One elemental ray			DURATION:1d4+1 rounds (see text)	SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:A ray of spiraling colors springs from your hand and streaks to its target. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit your target with the ray, which deals 2d6 points of acid damage, 2d6 points of cold damage, 2d6 points of electricity damage, and 2d6 points of fire damage. The type of energy that does the most points of damage to the target then persists, dealing another 4d6 points of that type of damage per round for 1d4 rounds.
Sanctify Weapons		TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=3|Cleric=5				SCHOOL:Transmutation																					COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius spread		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:Choose a specific subtype of evil outsider when you cast this spell, such as daemon, demon, devil, or div. All manufactured weapons in the area of effect bypass the DR of that type of outsider. The weapons do not become aligned or change composition.
Summon Stampede		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Summoner=4|Cleric,Druid=6			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Healing																		COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius herd of animals	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds		SAVEINFO:Reflex half (see text)		SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.51	DESC:You conjure a herd of aurochs or similar herd animal that immediately stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd takes up a 20-foot-radius space and moves at a rate of 120 feet per round in a straight line. Any creatures caught in the herd's path take 4d6+9 points of damage that round as they are trampled beneath dozens of animals' hooves. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. If the stampede's path would put it in an obviously dangerous area or force it to move through a solid barrier, the herd stops at the obstacle and moves in a new randomly determined direction until it reaches another obstacle or the spell's duration ends.
Vinetrap			TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=5					SCHOOL:Conjuration												VARIANTS:Blessed Thorns|Noxious Vines|Swift Vines	COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long		TARGETAREA:One creature				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates (see text)		SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.51	DESC:Vines choked with thorns, blossoms, leaflets, and other floral debris burst to life on and around the subject of this spell, winding around limbs and armor and making it progressively more difficult for the subject to maneuver. When this spell is cast, the subject may attempt a Reflex save. Success indicates that the vines fail to take root and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the subject's base speed is immediately reduced by 5 feet. Each round thereafter, the subject must make another successful Reflex save or his speed is reduced by another 5 feet. This occurs each round until he is reduced to a speed equal to half of what it was before the spell was cast. As a full-round action, the subject or an adjacent creature can tear the vines off the subject's body, resetting the speed penalty to just 5 feet, though the vines continue to grow each round thereafter for the spell's duration, requiring additional checks, unless it is actually dispelled. The spell's effects can also be prematurely ended by dealing at least 20 points of fire damage to the subject. When the spell's duration ends or the effect is terminated, the vines immediately wilt and the subject's speed returns to normal. Regardless of the subject's base speed, the vines cannot reduce a creature's speed below 5 feet. This spell has additional effects depending on which version you cast, chosen when you cast the spell. Blessed Thorns: The vines sprout vicious thorns made of celestial steel. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the subject takes 2d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage for each round since the creature last took a full-round action to tear the vines off. When you cast this version of the spell, you can also choose to make the thorns either cold iron or silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Noxious Vines: The vines emit noxious fumes that act as a lung and eye irritant. The subject and any creatures adjacent to the subject must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude check each round at the beginning of their turn. On a failed save, the creatures becomes blinded for that round and can't cast spells with verbal components. Swift Vines: The vines act twice as quickly as normal, and slow the creature by 10 feet per round instead of 5 feet (though they still can't decrease the creature's speed to less than half). In addition, once the creature is slowed to half­speed, it becomes staggered until the vines are torn off or the spell ends.
