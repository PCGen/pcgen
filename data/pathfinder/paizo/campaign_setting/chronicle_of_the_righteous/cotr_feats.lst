Celestial Obedience		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREFACTSET:1,DEITY,PANTHEON=Empyreal Lords	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=3			PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks, must worship an empyreal lord.			DESC:Your reverence for an empyreal lord is so great that daily prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons.						SOURCEPAGE:p.5	BENEFIT:Each empyreal lord requires a different daily obedience, but all obediences take no more than 1 hour per day to perform. Once you've performed the obedience, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the "Obedience" entry for the empyreal lord. If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your empyreal lord upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the empyreal lord's second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the empyreal lord's third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon's effects are constant. Mystery cultists gain access to these boons at lower levels as a benefit of their prestige class. If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience.
