Retrieve Item			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Calling										TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Long		TARGETAREA:Unattended object of 1 lb. or less whose longest dimension is 6 inches or less		DURATION:Permanent until discharged		SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:27		DESC:You call a specific nonliving item directly to your hand from a nearby location. First, you must cast the spell on the item while holding it. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and snapping your fingers. The item appears instantly in your hand. If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell fails.
Spherescry				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Divination			SUBSCHOOL:Scrying										TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 hour				RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:Shere of annihilation that previously devoured portion of caster's body			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:45		DESC:This spell allows remote viewing through spheres that have previously consumed some portion of the spellcasterâ€™s body: a single digit of a finger or toe at a minimum. The caster can view and listen to events within a 20-foot radius of the associated sphere; this radius follows the sphere if the sphere moves. Unlike a true scrying spell, no other spells operate through the associated sphere, but spherescry produces no indication of its activity on the target and cannot be discovered by normal methods of magical detection.
