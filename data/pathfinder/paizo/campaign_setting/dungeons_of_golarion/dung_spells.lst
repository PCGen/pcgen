Battering Blast	TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3					SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Force	COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature or unattended object		DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:Reflex partial; see text		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	DESC:You hurl (CASTERLEVEL/5) fist-sized ball(s) of force resembling a sphere of spikes to ram a designated creature or object. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. On a successful hit, you deal min(5,CASTERLEVEL/2)d6 points of force damage. A creature struck by any of these is subject to a bull rush attempt. The force has a Strength modifier equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). The CMB for the force's bull rush uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, adding the force's Strength modifier and a +10 bonus for each additional blast directed against the same target. Each sphere of force makes its own separate bull rush attempt-if multiple spheres strike one target, you make multiple CMB checks but only take the highest result to determine success. If the bull rush succeeds, the force pushes the creature away from you in a straight line, and the creature must make a Reflex save or fall prone. This spell pushes an unattended object struck by it 20 feet away from you, provided it weighs no more than 25 pounds per level (maximum 250 pounds). This spell cannot move creatures or objects beyond your range. Used on a door or other obstacle, the spell attempts a Strength check to destroy it if the sheer damage inflicted by the spell doesn't do the job.
Undeath Ward	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Inquisitor=4|Cleric=5|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6	SCHOOL:Abjuration				COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]	SAVEINFO:None or Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:You create a pale silver barrier that repels undead. Mindless undead and intelligent undead with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level cannot enter the area or penetrate the barrier. Undead of Hit Dice equal to or greater than your caster level can pass through this barrier by making a successful Will save against the spell, but as they do so, they take 3d6 points of damage. Once an undead creature makes its save against this spell and takes this damage, it can come and go without further penalty. This spell may only be used defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an undeath ward against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier. [Material Component] powdered silver
