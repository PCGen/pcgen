#Dream Eater
Dream Eating			KEY:Dream Eater ~ Dream Eating		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.DreamEater		SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a dream eater can consume a creature's subconscious dreams if the victim fails to resist with a Will save (DC %1). A sleeping victim takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against this ability, but automatically wakens if the save is successful. On a failed save, the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and the dream eater gains a number of psychic points equal to the Charisma drained, to a maximum amount of %2 psychic points.|10+HD/2+CHA|HD
Psychic Assault			KEY:Dream Eater ~ Psychic Assault		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.DreamEater		SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:As a swift action, a dream eater can imbue any melee attack he makes with a psychic assault, infusing the mind of the creature struck with hideous nightmare visions and hallucinations. The magnitude of the effect depends on how many psychic points the dream eater spends in the assault. By expending 1 point, the dream eater can cause the victim to become dazzled for 1d6 rounds. By expending 3 points, he can make a victim become staggered for 1d6 rounds. By expending 5 points, he can make the victim nauseated for 1d6 rounds. By expending 7 points, he can make the victim confused for 1d6 rounds. And by expending 9 points, he can stun the victim for 1d6 rounds. The victim can resist the psychic assault entirely by making a Will saving throw (DC %1).|10+HD/2+CHA

#Gallowdead
Chain of the Dead			KEY:Gallowdead ~ Chain of the Dead		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Gallowdead		SOURCEPAGE:p.21	DESC:As a standard action, a gallowdead can use its chain to attack its enemies. This acts as a ranged touch attack against any foe within 20 feet. If the attack hits, the target takes %1d6 points of damage. In addition, if the attack hits, the gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check against its target with a +4 racial bonus. If the check succeeds, the target becomes grappled, but the gallowdead does not gain the grappled condition in this case. The gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check each round to maintain its grip on the victim, but cannot take any of the special grapple actions against the victim if the check is a success.|min(10,HD/2)
Whispers				KEY:Gallowdead ~ Whispers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Gallowdead		SOURCEPAGE:p.22	DESC:A gallowdead constantly whispers vile secrets and blasphemous chants. Any creature within 30 feet of a whispering gallowdead must make a Will save (DC %1) or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Shaken creatures that fail this saving throw become nauseated by the secrets revealed. Each round, an affected creature may make a new Will save to recover from the effect-once a creature recovers from a gallowdead's whispers, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Each additional overlapping whisper aura from additional gallowdead increases the save DC by +2.|10+HD/2+CHA

#Shriezyx
Fear of Fire			KEY:Shriezyx ~ Fear of Fire			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Shriezyx		SOURCEPAGE:p.32	DESC:A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must make a Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round.
Poison				KEY:Shriezyx ~ Poison				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Shriezyx			SOURCEPAGE:p.32	DESC:Bite-injury; save Fort DC %1; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.|10+HD/2+CON
Slowing Toxin			KEY:Shriezyx ~ Slowing Toxin			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Shriezyx			SOURCEPAGE:p.32	DESC:A shriezyx's web is coated with a supernatural toxin that numbs and deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx's web must make a DC %1 Fortitude save or become slowed (as per the spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC %1 Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs-it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs, while they remain sticky and tangled, do not have this slowing effect.|10+HD/2+CON
