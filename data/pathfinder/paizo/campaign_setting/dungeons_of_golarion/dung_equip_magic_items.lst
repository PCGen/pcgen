Gem of Dreams	KEY:Gem of Dreams					TYPE:Artifact.Major			COST:0	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.43	QUALITY:Aura|strong necromancy	QUALITY:Caster Level|20nd	QUALITY:Slot|none	QUALITY:Destruction|The gem must absorb the dreams of a slumbering Spawn of Rovagug, whereupon it shatters into dust and releases a particularly powerful animate dream (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 29); the power of this animate dream is left to you, but it should be advanced in Hit Dice to a point where its CR is equal to 3 points above the party's average level. Needless to say, the animate dream immediately attacks-if not slain, it reforms as a new Gem of Dreams after 24 hours.	DESC:The Gem of Dreams can be used once per month to absorb the dreaming mind of any sleeping creature it is in contact with-this ability must be activated as a full-round action. The sleeping creature can resist this doom by making a DC 20 Will save-with a success, he is afflicted by a nightmare spell (CL 20th) but is otherwise unharmed. If he fails the save, his dreaming mind is stolen, warped, and then siphoned back into his body in the space of an hour. If the victim is awakened before this process completes, his body twists and transforms into a creature known as a dream eater (see above), at which point only wish or miracle (or the destruction of the Gem of Dreams) can restore him to his true form. At the point the transformation occurs, the creature that activated the gem's power ceases to age for a month. By using the gem every month (and creating more and more dream eaters), a person can effectively become immortal in this manner. While this is technically nothing more than a beneficial side effect, it is this power that has generated the majority of the gem's legendary fame.	DESCISPI:YES
Horns of Naraga	KEY:Horns of Naraga	NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Artifact.Major.Head.Helm		COST:0	WT:8		SOURCEPAGE:p.23	QUALITY:Aura|overwhelming varied	QUALITY:Caster Level|22nd	QUALITY:Slot|head	QUALITY:Destruction|The helm can be destroyed by crushing it between the jaws of an ancient black dragon's skull in the middle of a desert with the sun at its zenith.																																																						DESC:When worn by an undead creature, the Horns of Naraga reduce all damage taken from positive energy by half. In addition, whenever the wearer touches a living creature while wearing this helm (even if the touch is part of casting a spell or another touch attack), the touch deals an additional 5d6 points of negative energy damage and the wearer gains these hit points, just as if he had cast vampiric touch. The wearer of the helm is immune to acid and can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by magic. Once per day, on command, the helm can be ordered to transform into an ancient black dragon that obeys the creature that summoned it unquestioningly for 1 hour before reverting to a helm. Slaying the dragon does not destroy the helm, but it does prevent this ability from being used for 1 week. While the helm is in dragon form, the helm's owner does not receive any of the helm's other benefits.																														DESCISPI:YES

Raven Bracers	KEY:Raven Bracers					TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Wrist.Bracer	COST:16600	WT:4		SOURCEPAGE:p.62																																																																																																DESC:While worn, these bracers can be used as a swift action to grant the throwing and returning magic weapon qualities to any held melee weapon; these qualities persist for 1 round. This ability can be used three times a day. In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action, where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to silver raven figurines of wondrous power. Like those items, these ravens obey the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the animal messenger spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously for up to 24 hours. Once both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or once the 24-hour limt is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return unerringly to the owner's hands via teleportation.
