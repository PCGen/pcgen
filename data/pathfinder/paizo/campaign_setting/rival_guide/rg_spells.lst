Dazzling Blade							TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Pattern						COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One metal weapon						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.5				DESC:Dazzling blade makes a weapon appear dazzlingly shiny, as if crafted from pure silver and heavily polished. In combat, the flashing movements of a dazzling blade become almost hypnotic. The wielder of a weapon under the effects of dazzling blade gains a +min(5,(1+CASTERLEVEL/3)) competence bonus on all Bluff checks made to feint in combat. The wielder also gains a +min(5,(1+CASTERLEVEL/3)) competence bonus on all CMB checks made to disarm a foe, and a +min(5,(1+CASTERLEVEL/3)) competence bonus to his CMD against disarm attempts made against the weapon bearing the dazzling blade effect. The wielder of a dazzling blade can discharge the spell into a blinding burst of silvery light as a free action. The wielder selects an adjacent opponent as the focal point of this burst of light-that creature must make a Will save to avoid being blinded for 1 round (with a successful save, the creature is instead dazzled for 1 round). Despite its shiny appearance, a dazzling blade grants no extra benefit against creatures that are vulnerable to silver.
Dazzling Blade (Mass)						TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3					SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Pattern						COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) weapons, all within 30 ft.		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.5				DESC:Dazzling blade makes the target weapons appear dazzlingly shiny, as if crafted from pure silver and heavily polished. In combat, the flashing movements of a dazzling blade become almost hypnotic. The wielder of a weapon under the effects of dazzling blade gains a +min(5,(1+CASTERLEVEL/3)) competence bonus on all Bluff checks made to feint in combat. The wielder also gains a +min(5,(1+CASTERLEVEL/3)) competence bonus on all CMB checks made to disarm a foe, and a +min(5,(1+CASTERLEVEL/3)) competence bonus to his CMD against disarm attempts made against the weapon bearing the dazzling blade effect. The wielder of a dazzling blade can discharge the spell into a blinding burst of silvery light as a free action. The wielder selects an adjacent opponent as the focal point of this burst of light-that creature must make a Will save to avoid being blinded for 1 round (with a successful save, the creature is instead dazzled for 1 round). Each wielder of a dazzling blade can discharge the weapon's effect to attempt to blind a foe independently of the others. Despite its shiny appearance, a dazzling blade grants no extra benefit against creatures that are vulnerable to silver.
Echean's Excellent Enclosure		NAMEISPI:YES	TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9					SCHOOL:Abjuration						DESCRIPTOR:Force		COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Immobile 10-ft.-radius emanation			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]		SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:See text				SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed and creatures are affected as by antimagic field. An immobile sphere of impenetrable force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a spherical wall of force, including its immunity to dispel magic and vulnerability to a sphere of annihilation or rod of cancellation. The barrier has hardness 40 and (CASTERLEVEL*20) hit points, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from outside the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell's duration ends. Spells cannot be cast within, into, or out of the enclosure, and teleportation effects that ignore a wall of force (such as dimension door or teleport) are thwarted by the enclosure's field of antimagic. Echean's excellent enclosure has the same effect on summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead that an antimagic field does, causing them to wink out of existence for the duration of Echean's excellent enclosure unless their spell resistance, if any, allows them to remain where they are within the field. [Material Components] a sphere of glass worth 100 gp and an iron nail, with which you pierce the glass on casting
Greensight								TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Transmutation									COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched						DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL) minutes		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.23				DESC:Upon casting this spell, the recipient is empowered to see up to 60 feet through thick plant matter as though it were transparent. Leaves, vines, and greenery - even moss, lichen, and slime - offer no concealment to the recipient's sight, though her vision still can be blocked by solid wood, as if from trees or wooden structures. Undergrowth does not grant concealment to a creature against a recipient of the effects of greensight. [Material Component] a leaf
Sheet Lightning							TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity	COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius spread					DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.23				DESC:You create a dazzling flash of electricity that fills the target area. Sheet lightning inflicts 1 point of electricity damage to all creatures within the area of effect (no save). The true power of the spell, though, lies not in the damage it inflicts but in the overwhelming pain the lightning creates. The sudden flash and jolt dazes living creatures for 1 round if they fail a saving throw. Creatures that save are instead dazzled for 1 round. Any creature wearing metal armor takes a -2 penalty to its saving throw against this spell.
Staggering Fall							TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Transmutation									COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One falling creature					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds; see text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.35				DESC:This spell must be cast on a creature as it falls, either from a height or after being knocked prone or tripped. The magic of this spell causes the creature to hit the ground particularly hard, knocking the wind from it. The creature takes an additional 1d6 points of damage from the fall. In addition, the creature becomes staggered for the duration of the spell unless it makes a Will save. Each round the spell's effects persist, the creature may attempt a new Will save as a free action to end the staggered effect early. A creature under the effects of this spell must take a standard action to stand up.
Summon Accuser							TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	DESCRIPTOR:Evil|Lawful	COMPS:V,S,F/DF	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:1 accuser devil						DURATION:(10*CASTERLEVEL)			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.59				DESC:This spell summons a single accuser devil from Hell to do the spellcaster's bidding, similar to how summon monster spells function. Accuser devils, known to diabolists as zebubs, are hideous flying creatures with the torso of a plump human infant and the body and wings of an enormous fly. They make excellent spies, for they have the ability to grant visions of what they have witnessed to others-the Queen's Hands sometimes use summoned zebubs to observe suspects from afar. Accuser devils are detailed on page 84 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2. [Spell Focus] chunk of rotten meat
Summon Infernal Host						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	DESCRIPTOR:Evil|Lawful	COMPS:V,S,F/DF	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:1d4+1 lesser host devils or 1 greater host devil	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.59				DESC:This spell functions as summon monster V, save that it can only be used to summon host devils. These noxious flying devils, known also as gaavs and magaavs, are detailed on page 58 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Princes of Darkness, Book of the Damned, Vol. 1. [Spell Focus] strip of rune-inscribed parchment
