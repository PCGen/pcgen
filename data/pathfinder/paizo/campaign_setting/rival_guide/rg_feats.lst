# Ability Name			Category of Ability	Type				Required Ability								Required Lvl	Required Race			Required Template		Required Text					PRETOTALAB		Var. Min. Value				Req. Weapond Prof.	Define					Description																									Bonus to skill					Modify VAR					Allowed Companions																																											Source Page		Aspects									Benefits
Circling Offense			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility																							PRETOTALAB:3																	DESC:You are skilled at approaching large foes with an ally in a way that makes it difficult for your foes to find an advantage against you or your ally.																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.35											BENEFIT:You receive a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through a creature's reach, provided the creature is of a larger size category than you and provided at least one other ally with Circling Offense is within the creature's reach. If a creature that you're receiving this dodge bonus against attacks you and misses with the attack, it provokes attacks of opportunity from any of your allies who possess Circling Offense.
Footslasher				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																																			DESC:You are trained to strike at a large foe's feet to impede its movement and cause great pain.																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.35											BENEFIT:If you damage a foe that is of a larger size category than you with a weapon that does piercing or slashing damage, you can attempt to damage the creature's feet in a way that impedes its movement. Attacking a foe in this way is a standard action-you cannot use Footslasher as part of a full-attack action. When you use Footslasher, you take a -2 penalty on your attack roll, but if you hit and deal at least 1 point of damage to the target, it is affected as if by caltrops-its speed is reduced by half. This penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Footslasher does not stack with itself-once a foe has been wounded by this attack, its speed cannot be further reduced by additional attacks (or by damage from caltrops).
Greater Serpent Lash		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Serpent Lash																							PRETOTALAB:4																	DESC:Your ability to disarm and pull foes off balance with your whip is impressive.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.23											BENEFIT:When you make a successful disarm or trip maneuver using the Serpent Lash feat, you can make your additional disarm or trip attempt against any target within your whip's reach. With a reposition maneuver, you can move the target creature to any point within your whip's reach.
Jackal Heritage			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General												PRELEVEL:MAX=1	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Humanoid																															DESC:A jackalwere crouches somewhere in your family tree.																	BONUS:SKILL|Perception|2|TYPE=Racial																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.41	ASPECT:SaveBonus|+2 on saves vs. mind-affecting effects.	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects, and a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.
Serpent Lash			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat			PREVAREQ:HasWeaponFinesseFeat,1							PREWEAPONPROF:1,Whip																							DESC:You are adept at vexing multiple foes with your whip.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a disarm or trip maneuver with your whip. If it succeeds, you can make an additional disarm or trip maneuver with the same bonus against a target adjacent to the first and also within your whip's reach. In addition, you can use your whip to perform reposition maneuvers, though you take a -4 penalty on your CMB and you may only move the target toward you from its original position.
Slaying Sprint			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility,Spring Attack																				PRETOTALAB:13																	DESC:With swift feet and deadly intent, you finish off your target before anyone sees your blade.																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.11											BENEFIT:You can move up to half your speed instead of taking a 5-foot step when taking a full-round action to perform a coup de grace. Performing a coup de grace does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use this feat only when wielding a light or one-handed weapon.
Topple Foe				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise,Improved Trip																																							DESC:You and your allies can work together to trip larger foes.																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.35											BENEFIT:If you attempt to trip a foe that is larger than you, you gain a +1 bonus on your CMB check to trip the foe as long as an ally with Topple Foe is flanking the foe with you. If multiple allies with Topple Foe are flanking the foe with you, you gain an additional +2 bonus on your CMD check for each additional ally that's flanking the target. The bonuses granted by this feat stack with those granted by Improved Trip and Greater Trip. Each time you attempt to trip the same foe in consecutive rounds, the bonus granted to your trip attempt increases by +1 per ally, to a maximum bonus of +4 per flanking ally on the 4th round of consecutive trip attempts.
Vampiric Animal Companion	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Animal Companion									PRETEMPLATE:1,Vampire	PRETEXT:Sufficiently high level; see text				PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_CHA,18					DEFINE:VampiricAnimalCompanion|0	DESC:As a vampire, you may use your create spawn ability to transform a dire bat, dire rat, or wolf into a more powerful vampiric companion.										BONUS:VAR|VampiricAnimalCompanion|1	COMPANIONLIST:Animal Companion|Companion (Dire Rat)|PREVARGTEQ:AnimalCompanionMasterLVL,4	COMPANIONLIST:Animal Companion|Companion (Wolf)|PREVARGTEQ:AnimalCompanionMasterLVL,6	COMPANIONLIST:Animal Companion|Companion (Bat (Dire))|PREVARGTEQ:AnimalCompanionMasterLVL,9	SOURCEPAGE:p.47											BENEFIT:A vampire with this feat can elect to use its create spawn ability on an animal summoned using the child of the night ability (such as a dire bat, dire rat, or wolf) to create a vampiric animal companion. This decision must be made as a free action as the vampire slays the animal with its blood drain or energy drain ability. The animal rises from death in 1d4 days as a vampiric animal bonded with the vampire who spawned it. Thereafter, the vampiric animal advances in abilities like a normal animal companion as the vampire gains further class levels in the class that granted the animal companion. In order to gain a dire rat as a vampiric companion, a vampire's effective druid level must be 4th. To gain a wolf as an vampiric companion, the vampire's effective druid level must be 6th. To gain a dire bat vampiric companion, the vampire's effective druid level must be 9th. At your option, additional animals could be added to this list - use these examples as guides to set minimum levels. Vampiric animal companions count toward the total number of Hit Dice a vampire may enslave, as well as toward the limit of animal companions the character may have at any one time. Any vampiric animal companion the vampire creates that would exceed such limits becomes a free-willed undead. A vampire may also free a vampiric companion in order to enslave a new one, but once freed, the vampiric animal cannot be enslaved again.
