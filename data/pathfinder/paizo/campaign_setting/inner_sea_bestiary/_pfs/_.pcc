DESC:This book contains dozens of new monsters found in the Inner Sea region-all invented specifically for the Pathfinder campaign setting! Some, like the gearsmen of Numeria or the moth-like star monarchs who serve the goddess of dreams, have been mentioned many times in Pathfinder Campaign Setting books, but others, like the alien vespergaunt or Rahadoum's desert-dwelling whirlmaws, have only been obliquely illustrated or mentioned before. And some-like the mysterious and ancient veiled masters, and the disturbingly alluring fungus queen-make their appearance for the first time in print after debuting in Paizo's office campaigns.
