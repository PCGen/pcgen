Caravan Guard						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait.Sandru	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Caravan Guard],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:You recently hired on to Sandru's caravan to serve as a guard, but the job, while it paid well, gave you little chance to scratch the adventuring itch, since the caravan never really ventured into dangerous territory. You understand why Sandru avoided the more dangerous  routes, of course, but that didn't help assuage your urge to seek adventure. You've just told Sandru that you're quitting the job in order to try your hand at adventuring - he seemed to understand, and even gave you some good tips on how best to survive potential challenges. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks, and Survival becomes a class skill for you.

Someday, maybe you'll be able to earn her love, but for now, you're content to spend time in her proximity, or even to do things for her that might earn you a word of thanks or a smile. Once per day, you may attempt to earn a kind word or a smile from Ameiko by making a DC 15 Charisma check. If you're successful, the elation and joy at the attention gives you a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws for the remainder of the day. If you're ever lucky enough to win Ameiko's love, this +1 trait bonus on saving throws applies at all times, as long as your relationship remains active. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten Ameiko.

Someday, maybe you'll be able to earn her love, but for now, you're content to spend time in her proximity, or even to do things for her that might earn you a word of thanks or a smile. Once per day, you may attempt to earn a kind word or a smile from Shalelu by making a DC 15 Charisma check. If you're successful, the elation and joy at the attention gives you a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws for the remainder of the day.

Foster Child						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait.Koya		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Foster Child],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:Koya Mvashti might be old enough to be your grandmother, but to you, she's always been your mom. Ever since your parents passed away, Koya's been taking care of you as if she were your mother. You never really figured out why Koya took you into her care, but you do know she's done this before - most recently with Sandru Vhiski, whom you think of as your brother. Growing up, Koya made sure that you had the best education possible, particularly in one particular topic. Choose any Knowledge skill - you gain a +2 bonus on skill checks with that Knowledge skill, and it becomes a class skill for you.

Friend of the Family					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait.Koya		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Friend of the Family],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:Your family has been close friends with the Mvashtis for as long as you've been alive. Old Niska Mvashti's recent death wasn't all that unexpected - she must have been over a hundred years old, as far as you know - but it was a sobering moment nonetheless. What no one else in your family knows, though, is that in the weeks before her death, Niska must have known that her days were numbered, because she called you to her house one day and made you make a promise: If her daughter Koya ever went on a long trip, you would go with her to ensure her safety. Although the chances of Koya going on a long trip seem remote (she must be at least 60 years old, after all), you've made a promise to Niska to accompany her daughter if such an event comes to pass. Ever since you made this promise, you've felt a strange sense of destiny looming in your future - you might even think that Niska is now watching over your shoulder, just as she asked you to watch over her daughter. As a result of this eerie sense of being watched over, you've been able to react to dangerous situations more quickly than ever. As long as Koya remains alive, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks, and Perception becomes a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten Koya.																BONUS:SKILL|Perception|1|TYPE=Trait	CSKILL:Perception	SOURCEPAGE:p.12

You, though, take this admiration to a new level - you practically worship Ameiko. This could be because you saw her perform a particularly impressive act of bravery at some point in the past, or maybe she just happened to give you the exact right words of encouragement or a kind gift at some point a few years ago when you were young and impressionable. In any case, you've done your best to emulate Ameiko's talents at spellcasting. You gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your hero.

Rescued (Koya)			NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait.Koya		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rescued (Koya)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:At some point in the past, you had a terrifyingly close brush with death. Maybe a goblin nearly killed you during an attack on the town, or perhaps a building struck by a giant's boulder collapsed around you. Whatever the peril was, you would have certainly died if not for the swift actions of Koya, who intervened just in time to save your life. You've never forgotten this, and remain fiercely loyal to her. Perhaps even more importantly, the method in which she saved you seems to have had an impact on your own skills. Koya saved you by casting a healing spell on you just before you died, and as a result you gain a +2 trait bonus whenever you use cure spells to heal damage. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your savior.

Maybe a goblin nearly killed you during an attack on the town, or perhaps a building struck by a giant's boulder collapsed around you.

You've never forgotten this, and remain fiercely loyal to her. Perhaps even more importantly, the method in which she saved you seems to have had an impact on your own skills. Shalelu saved you by pulling you to safety while simultaneously defeating the peril that almost did you in, and as a result, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Acrobatics checks and Acrobatics is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your savior.																																																																																																BONUS:SKILL|Acrobatics|1|TYPE=Trait	CSKILL:Acrobatics	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Student Survivalist					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait.Shalelu	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Student Survivalist],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:Although she is seen as something of a mystery to most of Sandpoint's citizens, Shalelu has never really seemed all that mysterious to you. Of course, that's probably because she helped raise you. You have never quite figured out why Shalelu decided to treat you as a younger sibling, but you certainly appreciated it - and you eagerly absorbed all of the survivalist tricks that she showed you over the years. As a result, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all Survival checks, and Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your mentor.

While your sister always took care of you, she never supported your desire to become an adventurer - Ameiko never explained why, only saying, "Adventuring can cause a lot of pain just as easily as it can bring success and riches." As a younger sibling to one of Sandpoint's more influential citizens, you share some of her innate talent and skill at adventuring. Your ferocious independence and self-confidence give you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your older sister.																																																																																																														BONUS:SAVE|Will|1|TYPE=Trait											SOURCEPAGE:p.13
