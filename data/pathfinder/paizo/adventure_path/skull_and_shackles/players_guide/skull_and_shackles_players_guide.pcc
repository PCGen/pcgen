DESC:The Skull & Shackles Player's Guide gives players all the spoiler-free information, inspiration, and new rules they'll need to create characters prepared for the swashbuckling adventure and piratical perils of the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path.  Within, players of this campaign will find everything they need to create character backgrounds tied to personalities and events vital to Adventure Path's expedition onto the high seas, along with new campaign-specific traits to give bold adventurers the edge they'll need to take on the varied and unpredictable dangers of the pirate isles known as the Shackles. New rules for ship-to-ship combat also give players the resources they'll need to sail pirate vessels, board enemy ships, and claim plunder as true scallywags.  Adventurers don't need to take to the seas unprepared! Gather your allies, practice your best pirate voice, and let the Skull & Shackles Player's Guide set your course for the swashbuckling adventure of the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path.
