Old salts and sea dogs nod knowingly and say that Besmara the Pirate Queen, goddess of piracy, sea monsters, and strife, has marked you for a greater destiny. You don't know anything about that, but you've always felt more at home on the sea than on land, and your keen eyes can easily pick out a sail on the distant horizon. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception and Profession (sailor) checks. In addition, once per week you can reroll a Profession (sailor) check and take the higher result (you must announce that you are using this ability before the results of the check are known).

In addition, you gain a one-time +1 trait bonus to your Disrepute and Infamy scores (see "The Life of a Pirate" in Pathfinder Adventure Path #55 for details on the Infamy system). You went to a tavern called the Formidably Maid, a notorious pirate hangout in Port Peril, eager to start your career as a buccaneer. While you were there, however, a dashing and flirtatious corsair caught your eye, and after a whirlwind night of booze and romance, you found yourself beaten senseless and stuffed in a sack, carried off to who knows where.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																																						BONUS:SKILL|Intimidate,Profession (Sailor)|1|TYPE=Trait									SOURCEPAGE:p.5

While drinking at a tavern called the Formidably Maid in Port Peril last night, you got into a brawl with some of the other patrons. You handled yourself well, but a group of rough-looking characters ganged up on you and overwhelmed you, knocking you unconscious. Fortunately, you were able to conceal your brass knuckles when you were press-ganged, and you begin the campaign with them, regardless of your starting circumstances.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																																																																																						KIT:1|DocksideBrawler	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	ASPECT:Effect|+1 damage with Brass Knuckles or Improvised Weapon.

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps). In addition, you begin the campaign with a selection mundane trade goods worth 50 gp that you were able to scrounge together during your first day on the Wormwood. You found yourself relatively well off when you got your share of your last voyage's plunder, and decided to spend a few of your hard-won coins at the Formidably Maid, a popular pirate tavern in Port Peril. Maybe the shine of your new wealth distracted you, however, because you never saw the miscreants who slipped something into your drink, knocking you out cold.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																														BONUS:SITUATION|Perception=Notice Hidden Object|1|TYPE=Trait	BONUS:SKILL|Appraise|1|TYPE=Trait									KIT:1|EyeForPlunder	SOURCEPAGE:p.6

In addition, your familiarity with the pirate's life allows you to make untrained Knowledge (local) checks regarding pirates or the region of the Shackles.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	DESC:You grew up in the city of Ilizmagorti on Mediogalti Island, a pirate port infamous for both the scoundrels who visit it and the feared Red Mantis assassins who run it. You've been around pirates all your life, but you've learned to be wary in your dealings with people, as there's no telling who might be a Red Mantis in disguise. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks, and Sense Motive is a class skill for you. In addition, your familiarity with the pirate's life allows you to make untrained Knowledge (local) checks regarding pirates or the region of the Shackles. Looking to make your fortune, you hopped aboard a pirate ship in Ilizmagorti, and decided to celebrate your safe arrival in Port Peril with a few drinks at a tavern called the Formidably Maid. There were some suspiciouslooking characters there, to be sure, and you decided to give them a wide berth, but as you left, feeling a bit woozy from drink, you were set upon by thugs in a dark alley and knocked unconscious.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																						BONUS:SKILL|Sense Motive|1|TYPE=Trait												SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Peg Leg					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Peg Leg],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]					DESC:You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves, and you also gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against sharks and other animals with the aquatic subtype.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	DESC:One of your legs was bitten off below the knee by a shark when you were just a child, and was replaced with a wooden peg leg (Pathfinder Player Companion: Pirates of the Inner Sea 20). You've long since gotten used to your prosthesis, however, and take none of the normal penalties from having a peg leg. You've had to learn to deal with the pain of your injury as well, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves. Ever since your accident you've hated sharks, and you also gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against sharks and other animals with the aquatic subtype. Your balance always gets a bit shaky after a few drinks, and last night at the Formidably Maid-a tavern in Port Peril-was no exception. That must be why you fell to the floor as soon as you tried to stand up. What happened next is hazy, but you're pretty sure you were dragged out of the bar and onto a ship at the docks. At least they didn't throw you to the sharks...|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																													BONUS:SAVE|Fortitude|1|TYPE=Trait												BONUS:SKILL|Sense Motive|1|TYPE=Trait												SOURCEPAGE:p.6	ASPECT:Effect|+1 damage vs sharks and other animals with aquatic subtype
Ship's Surgeon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ship's Surgeon],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]				DESC:You gain a +1 trait bonus on Craft (Carpentry) and Heal checks, and Heal is a class skill for you.  You Begin the campaign with a fully stocked healer's kit.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	DESC:On a ship, a sailor often has to learn multiple skills, and this rule certainly applies to you. Your father was a woodworker, and you learned your first trade from him. But on your first voyage at sea you quickly found out that a carpenter is often a ship's doctor as well-after all, who knows more about sawing off limbs than someone who saws wood for a living? People are a lot bloodier than wood, that's for sure, but you haven't had many complaints-those sailors who have enjoyed your services are either happy to be alive or dead, and there's old salts who swear the peg legs you for made them are better than the real legs they used to have. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Craft (carpentry) and Heal checks, and Heal is a class skill for you. You were between ships in Port Peril, and after stopping for a drink at a tavern called the Formidably Maid, you happened upon a damsel in distress in the alleyway outside. Thinking you could help, you didn't notice the thugs hiding nearby, and they caught you unawares. You've been on enough ships to know a press gang by the blow of the sap on the back of your neck-you just hope whatever ship you end up on needs a surgeon. Although the majority of your equipment was taken away when you were press-ganged, you managed to hang on to a fully stocked healer's kit, and you begin the campaign with it, regardless of your starting circumstances.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																			BONUS:SKILL|Heal,Craft (Carpentry)|1|TYPE=Trait				CSKILL:Heal		KIT:1|ShipsSurgeon	SOURCEPAGE:p.7

In addition, penalties on attack rolls made underwater are lessened by 1.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility	DESC:You've always felt the call of the sea and your blood surges with the ebb and flow of the tides. Perhaps one of your parents was a sailor or pirate, or maybe one of your ancestors had a bit of aquatic elf or undine blood in them. Whatever the reason, you're as comfortable in the water as you are on land. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Swim checks and Swim is a class skill for you. In addition, penalties on attack rolls made underwater are lessened by 1. You came to Port Peril in search of your destiny, and after a few drinks at a tavern called the Formidably Maid, you went down to the docks to take in a view of the sea. The last thing you remember is a blow to the back of your head and the waves rushing up to meet you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullAbility																																																																																																																																																				BONUS:SKILL|Swim|1|TYPE=Trait							CSKILL:Swim						SOURCEPAGE:p.7	ASPECT:Effect|Penalties on atk rolls underwater reduced by 1
