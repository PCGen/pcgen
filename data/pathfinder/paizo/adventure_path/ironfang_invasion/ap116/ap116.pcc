DESC:Even as the adventurers find sanctuary in the Fangwood Forest, dire threats encroach on their woodland haven. The black dragon Ibzairiak the Scar-Maker, leading a contingent of Ironfang troops, has broken the back of the legendary Chernasardo Rangers who once defended the woodsâ€”and he has claimed the southern Fangwood as his own. With the Chernasardo Rangers gone, all of Fangwood Forest's deadliest inhabitants are again free to stalk and revel as they please, with the adventurers and their vulnerable refugees trapped in the middle. Alone and desperate for allies, the adventurers must siege the Rangers' fallen fortresses one by one, taking them back from the monsters that now infest them. Can they rescue what remains of the once-unstoppable freedom fighters, or will they too fall to the ravages of Ibzairiak?
