A wielder's head hair or beard hair must be at least 2 feet long to activate this ability. Sundering the wielder's hair (hp 2) immediately causes the korrigan club to fall to the ground and renders the wielder unable to activate this special ability until the lost length regrows.

Periapt of Placebos			TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	COST:3600	WT:1																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.44	SPROP:What at first appears to be a fine gem dangling from a long, silver chain is in fact a cut and polished bezoar. This necklace—often mistaken for a periapt of health or a periapt of proof against poison—inspires its wearer with the utter conviction that he has been rendered immune to both disease and poison. While the necklace imparts no genuine protections, the strength of belief it imparts nonetheless grants its wearer a +2 morale bonus to all Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons. Unless the person identifying a periapt of placebos succeeds at her Spellcraft check by 5 or more, she mistakenly believes it to be a more powerful protective necklace rather than discerning its true nature.
Lidless Charm Bracelet			TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	COST:10000	WT:1																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	SPROP:Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can touch the bracelet to a creature with a gaze attack (requiring a successful touch attack for unwilling creatures) and become immune to natural gaze attacks from all creatures of that kind for the following 24 hours. This ability does not grant immunity to gaze attacks from spells or magic items such as eyes of doom. For the duration of this immunity, the five charms on the bracelet each appear to be closed eyes. When the wearer fails a save against a gaze attack, she can expend a charm from the bracelet as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw, but must take the second result even if it is worse. An expended charm crumbles to dust. When the last charm is expended, the lidless charm bracelet loses all magical properties.
