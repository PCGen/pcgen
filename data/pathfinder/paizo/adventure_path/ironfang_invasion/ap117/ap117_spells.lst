#Full Spell Descriptions
Barghest Feast.MOD						DESC:The target gains the ability to absorb power from devouring a humanoid corpse. To use this ability, the target must feed on the corpse of one nonevil humanoid creature, a process that takes 1 full round per Hit Die the creature had and provokes attacks of opportunity. For every 2 rounds it feeds on the corpse in this way, the target gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks (to a maximum of +5).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hobbling Bomb Admixture.MOD					DESC:Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extracts duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can have only one admixture effect (formula with the words "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a target directly, it affects up to three targets-the creature the bomb hit directly, and up to two other creatures that take damage from the splash damage (alchemists choice). Each targeted creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or have its speed reduced by 20 feet (minimum 0 feet).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Blood Armor (Hadregash).MOD					DESC:Your blood becomes as hard as iron upon contact with air. Each time you take at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, your armor gains a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. This enhancement bonus stacks with itself, but not with an existing enhancement bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +5. This spell has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lead Blades (Hadregash).MOD					DESC:Lead blades increases the momentum and density of your melee weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when the spell is cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they actually are. For instance, a Medium longsword normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if benefiting from lead blades (see page 145 of the Core Rulebook for more information). Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses one of your weapons to make an attack it deals damage as normal for its size.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Monster II (Hadregash).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list. Additionally, Hadregash's priests can summon goblins snakes (Bestiary 3 p.132) in addition to the normal creatures listed in the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Monster V (Hadregash).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list. Additionally, Hadregash's priests can summon barghests (Bestiary p.27) in addition to the normal creatures listed in the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Monster VI (Hadregash).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list. Additionally, Hadregash's priests can summon greater barghests (Bestiary p.27) in addition to the normal creatures listed in the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
