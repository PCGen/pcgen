DESC:The Carrion Crown Player's Guide gives players all the spoiler-free information, inspiration, and new rules they'll need to create characters prepared for the horrors of the Carrion Crown Adventure Path. Within, players of this campaign will find everything they need to create character backgrounds tied to the grim events that kick off Adventure Path's most horrifying series, along with new campaign-specific traits to give bold adventurers the edge they'll need to take on the frightful country of Ustalav's myriad menaces. New rules for employing the Harrow Deck also put the mystery and magic of that fateful fortunetelling device at the players' disposal when they'll need it most. Adventurers need not venture into the darkness unprepared; gather your courage and let the Carrion Crown Player's Guide be your first step into the nightmare of the Carrion Crown.
