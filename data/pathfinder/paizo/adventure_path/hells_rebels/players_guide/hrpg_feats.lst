Noble Scion (Hell's Rebels)		KEY:Noble Scion (Hell's Rebels)			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Campaign.General.FirstLevelOnly	DESC:You are a member of one of the significant noble families of Kintargo, whether or not you remain in good standing with your family. Note that the Victocora family has gone missing and its estate recently burned to the ground, so they’re not an option for this feat. Note also that the Delronge, Sarini, and Tanessen families are well known Thrune sympathizers, so that if you choose to be a member of one of these families, you should play an outcast from the family, someone who’s been shunned and perhaps even disinherited from the family for personal or political views. (In such a case, you’d still gain the monetary boon from the Child of Kintargo trait, should you take it. This boon represents all you’ve managed to get away with before being kicked out of the house.)	PRETEXT:Prerequisites&colon; Charisma 13 or Child of Kintargo trait, must be taken at 1st level.

You also gain an additional benefit, depending on which family you belong to. Special: This is a variant of the Noble Scion trait presented in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide, customized to fit more seamlessly with a Kintargo-based campaign. If you take this version of the feat, you cannot also take the version presented in The Inner Sea World Guide.
