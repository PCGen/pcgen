DESC:The Wrath of the Righteous Player's Guide gives players all the spoiler-free information, inspiration, and advice they'll need to create characters prepared for delving into an adventure of mythic proportions in the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path. Within, players of this campaign will find everything they need to create character backgrounds tied to personalities and events vital to Pathfinder Adventure Pathâ€™s fight to turn back the tide of demonic influence in the Worldwound. Inside players find campaign-specific traits to give adventurers the edge they need to take on cruel demons, evil cultists, and horrific threats encountered where the Abyss touches Golarion. This player's guide also features a brief overview of the previous crusades and a look at the city of Kenbres where the excitement begins, as well as various options for heroes ready to take up the call to fight the demonic horde! Adventurers don't need to head out unprepared! Polish your sword, rally the troops and let the Wrath of the Righteous Player's Guide start your trip into the thrill and danger of the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path.
