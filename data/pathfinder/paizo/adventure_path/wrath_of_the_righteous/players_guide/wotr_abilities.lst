Chance Encounter					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Chance Encounter],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You always tended to get in over your head as a child, but your biggest youthful misadventure was the time you "accidentally" found yourself behind enemy lines in the Worldwound. You probably never would have made it back home to Kenabres if not for the help of a mysterious woman who helped you trick your way through a group of cultists. Once per day, if you fail an Acrobatics, Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check, you may immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. Associated Mythic Path: Trickster. 																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.5
Child of the Crusade				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Child of the Crusade],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESCISPI:YES	DESC:Your parents were members of the crusade, as were their parents before them. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would possess or incapacitate you mentally, you may immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. Associated Mythic Path: Marshal. 																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.5
Exposed to Awfulness				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Exposed to Awfulness],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESCISPI:YES	DESC:When you were a child, you were nearly slain by a demon that managed to make its way through the wardstones into the lands beyond. The demon was slain before it could kill you, but you lingered at death's door in a coma for weeks before waking. Ever since then, you've been unusually hale and hearty, as if your body had endured its brush with awfulness by becoming supernaturally fit. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would kill or physically incapacitate you, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. Associated Mythic Path: Guardian. 																														SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Riftwarden Orphan					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Riftwarden Orphan],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You bear a strange birthmark on your body-something you've learned is the Sign of the Seeker's Spiral, a rune associated with the secret society known as the Riftwardens. You have researched this rune, and have learned that the mark sometimes appears on the children of Riftwardens who have been exposed to particularly strange planar energies. Unfortunately, you never knew your parents, for you were raised by a foster family in Kenabres. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all concentration checks. Associated Mythic Path: Archmage. 																																								BONUS:CONCENTRATION|ALLSPELLS|2|TYPE=Trait														SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Stolen Fury							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Stolen Fury],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]				DESCISPI:YES	DESC:You were forced to take part in a demonic ritual as a youth after having been captured by cultists. Whatever the ritual's purpose may have been, it didn't work out the way your captors envisioned-rather than corrupting your soul, you absorbed the ritual's energy and made it your own before you escaped to safety. Today, when you face demons in combat, those energies bolster your fury, granting you a +2 trait bonus on all combat maneuver checks against demons. Associated Mythic Path: Champion. 																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Touched by Divinity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:2,[PREDEITY:1,Y],[PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Touched by Divinity],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]]		DESCISPI:YES	DESC:As long as you can remember,you've had an unexplainable interest in one deity in particular. One of your parents may have been a priest of this deity, or you may have been an orphan raised by the church, but these alone cannot explain your deep connection to the faith. You've always felt calm and at ease in places holy to the deity, and often have dreams about the god or goddess visiting you-most often in the form of a sacred animal or creature. You begin play with a silver holy symbol of your chosen deity for free. In addition, choose one domain associated with your chosen deity. You gain the use of that domain's 1st-level domain spell as a spell-like ability usable once per day (CL equals your character level). Associated Mythic Path: Hierophant.
