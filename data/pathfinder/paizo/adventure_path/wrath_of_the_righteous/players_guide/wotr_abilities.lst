Chance Encounter		KEY:Trait ~ Chance Encounter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Chance Encounter],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]						DESC:Once per day, if you fail an Acrobatics, Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check, you may immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.5	ASPECT:Campaign Information|You always tended to get in over your head as a child, but your biggest youthful misadventure was the time you "accidentally" found yourself behind enemy lines in the Worldwound. You probably never would have made it back home to Kenabres if not for the help of a mysterious woman who helped you trick your way through a group of cultists. The woman never told you her name, but you remember her beauty and a deep sense of sadness she seemed to carry with her. Her skill with the bow was impressive as well, but the thing you remember most about her was the symbol of Desna she wore--she often held onto it without seeming to realize it, as if the connection to the goddess was something she clung to in a sense of need, as someone might clutch at a rope while dangling over a vast pit. She left your side a few moments before you were picked up by a patrol of crusaders, who finished the job of escorting you back to safety, and you've never seen her again. Ever since, you've just been lucky when it comes to trickery.	ASPECT:Associated Mythic Path|Trickster.	ASPECT:Multiple Characters|You and other characters were all saved by the same mysterious woman in your childhood. This could have been the same event, or she could have saved you on separate occasions--the discovery that someone else was saved by the mysterious stranger has resulted in a long friendship (or perhaps friendly rivalry) with the others she rescued.		ASPECT:SkillBonus|Once per day, if you fail an Acrobatics, Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check, you may immediately reroll that check as a free action.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Trickster
Child of the Crusade	KEY:Trait ~ Child of the Crusade	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Child of the Crusade],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]						DESC:Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would possess or incapacitate you mentally, you may immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.5	ASPECT:Campaign Information|Your parents were members of the crusade, as were their parents before them. (If you are an elf, gnome, or other long-lived race, these could be brothers or cousins instead, since it's possible that the Worldwound simply didn't exist at a time before you were born.) The righteousness of the crusades sometimes feels as if it runs in your very blood, and it bolsters you against demonic influence. Your parents may be alive still, or they may have perished on a mission--that choice is up to you. You grew up knowing them, though, and their zeal and devotion to the crusade is the primary reason you feel the same way. They've told you of other family members who have also been involved in the crusade, and it's not uncommon for you to meet a distant cousin or long-lost aunt, uncle, or other family member while traveling among the border towns of Mendev. This strong family tie bolsters your mind and sense of belonging to the crusade.														ASPECT:Associated Mythic Path|Marshal.	ASPECT:Multiple Characters|If other characters take this trait, you should all be related--you can be siblings, cousins, or even more distant relations, but you should all be aware of this shared lineage.																												ASPECT:CombatBonus|When you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would possess or incapacitate you mentally, you may immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action, 1/day.
Exposed to Awfulness	KEY:Trait ~ Exposed to Awfulness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Exposed to Awfulness],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]						DESC:Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would kill or physically incapacitate you, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.6	ASPECT:Campaign Information|When you were a child, you were nearly slain by a demon that managed to make its way through the wardstones into the lands beyond. The demon was slain before it could kill you, but you lingered at death's door in a coma for weeks before waking. Ever since then, you've been unusually hale and hearty, as if your body had endured its brush with awfulness by becoming supernaturally fit. But still, the scars (whether physical or purely mental) of your brush with death remain, and nightmares of what could have happened often plague your sleep. Something, be it your own personal force of will, some strange "infection" from the assault, or perhaps a combination of both, has made you stronger than before. You're not sure what to make of the theories that you survived this exposure to awfulness because you yourself have some trace of demonic heritage that helped give you the advantage you needed to survive--but whatever it was, you're glad for it! Your strange resistance to demonic attacks persists to this day.	ASPECT:Associated Mythic Path|Guardian.	ASPECT:Multiple Characters|You and any others with this trait are related, if only distantly. You could be siblings or cousins--a condition that perhaps lends some credence to the theory that all of you share more than just a common bloodline.																						ASPECT:CombatBonus|Immediately reroll saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would kill or physically incapacitate you, 1/day, as free action.
Riftwarden Orphan		KEY:Trait ~ Riftwarden Orphan		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Riftwarden Orphan],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]						DESC:You gain a +2 trait bonus on all concentration checks.																																			BONUS:CONCENTRATION|ALLSPELLS|2|TYPE=Trait																						SOURCEPAGE:p.6	ASPECT:Campaign Information|You bear a strange birthmark on your body--something you've learned is the Sign of the Seeker's Spiral, a rune associated with the secret society known as the Riftwardens. You have researched this rune, and have learned that the mark sometimes appears on the children of Riftwardens who have been exposed to particularly strange planar energies. Unfortunately, you never knew your parents, for you were raised by a foster family in Kenabres. Your foster family has confirmed that both of your parents were Riftwardens, and has further confirmed that your parents went missing on a secret mission into the Worldwound less than a month after you were born. You're not sure what happened to them, but you're certain they're dead--and your gut tells you that the one who murdered them yet lives! In any event, you've long felt magic in your blood, and casting spells comes easily to you.																								ASPECT:Associated Mythic Path|Archmage.	ASPECT:Multiple Characters|You should be siblings with any other character that takes this trait, so that you share the same missing parents. Your parents could even be foster parents.
Stolen Fury			KEY:Trait ~ Stolen Fury			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Stolen Fury],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]							DESC:This nagging has instilled in you a fury against demonkind. Today, when you face demons in combat, those energies bolster your fury, granting you a +2 trait bonus on all combat maneuver checks against demons.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.6	ASPECT:Campaign Information|You were forced to take part in a demonic ritual as a youth after having been captured by cultists. Whatever the ritual's purpose may have been, it didn't work out the way your captors envisioned--rather than corrupting your soul, you absorbed the ritual's energy and made it your own before you escaped to safety. Ever since, you've been haunted by strange nightmares about the ritual, and have long felt that the energies it bathed you in have changed you. Recently, those energies have changed--it's as if you've finally managed to come to terms with your past and have turned the ritual's aftereffects to your advantage, following the old adage of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. You've been unable to learn more about the ritual or what it was for, but the question lingers in the back of your head to this day.																																	ASPECT:Associated Mythic Path|Champion.	ASPECT:Multiple Characters|You and any other PC who takes this trait were all part of the same ritual, and it was only by working together that you managed to escape--further, the support of your fellow ritual survivors has played a key role in your coming to terms with it, and you retain a close bond of friendship (or perhaps a friendly rivalry) to this day.		ASPECT:CombatBonus|+2 trait bonus on all combat maneuver checks against demons.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Mythic Path ~ Champion
Touched by Divinity	KEY:Trait ~ Touched by Divinity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:2,[PREDEITY:1,Y],[PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Touched by Divinity],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]]	DESC:You begin play with a silver holy symbol of your chosen deity for free. In addition, choose one domain associated with your chosen deity. You gain the use of that domain's 1st-level domain spell as a spell-like ability usable once per day (CL %1).|TL				DEFINE:TbdTimesPerDay|0		BONUS:VAR|TbdTimesPerDay|1		KIT:1|Touched By Divinity		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Touched by Divinity Domain Choice|1		SOURCEPAGE:p.7	ASPECT:Campaign Information|As long as you can remember, you've had an unexplainable interest in one deity in particular. One of your parents may have been a priest of this deity, or you may have been an orphan raised by the church, but these alone cannot explain your deep connection to the faith. You've always felt calm and at ease in places holy to the deity, and often have dreams about the god or goddess visiting you--most often in the form of a sacred animal or creature. Your faith is strong, even if you don't happen to be a divine spellcaster--if you are a divine spellcaster, you should be a worshiper of this deity.																																																																							ASPECT:Associated Mythic Path|Hierophant.	ASPECT:Multiple Characters|If other characters choose this trait, you should all work together to decide what deity you're associated with--it should be the same deity shared by all of you. You might even share the same dreams.
