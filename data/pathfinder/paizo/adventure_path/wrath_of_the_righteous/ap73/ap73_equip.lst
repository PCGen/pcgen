Bilious Bottle									KEY:Bilious Bottle										TYPE:Goods.Alchemical.Flask.Consumable	COST:500	WT:2																								SOURCEPAGE:p.64																						QUALITY:Aura|faint conjuration	QUALITY:Caster Level|5th	QUALITY:Slot|none	QUALITY:Construction Cost|250 gp	QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, stinking cloud																																														DESC:A bilious bottle appears to be a tightly stoppered container of water. It can be thrown as a splash weapon. When a bilious bottle is opened or shatters, the foul fluid inside immediately expands into a 30-foot-radius cloud of noxious vapors. These vapors are invisible, but any creature within the area of effect of the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn or suffer one of the following random effects. The vapors created by a bilious bottle dissipate after 1 minute, or automatically if exposed to anything more than a moderate wind. The vapors created by a bilious bottle are a poison effect.
Brazen Head										KEY:Brazen Head											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous				COST:6500	WT:10																								SOURCEPAGE:p.64																						QUALITY:Aura|faint divination (evil) and enchantment (evil)	QUALITY:Caster Level|5th	QUALITY:Slot|none	QUALITY:Construction Cost|3,250 gp	QUALITY:Construction Requirements|Craft Wondrous Item, bless, augury, must worship Baphomet																																						DESC:A brazen head is an object sacred to the cult of Baphomet. Most brazen heads appear to be the head of a minotaur, but others in the shape of humans, animals, or multi-faced demons exist.&nl;When mounted on a wall in an area sacred to Baphomet, the brazen head constantly breathes out invisible vapors that fill a 60-foot spread. Any evil creature in this area gains the benefit of a bless spell.&nl;When in the area of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Baphomet, a brazen head can be used once per month to perform an augury. Rumors exist of more powerful brazen heads capable of casting divination or even commune.
Longsword (Base).COPY=Radiance						KEY:Radiance					SORTKEY:Radiance																					EQMOD:Material ~ Cold Iron.Special Ability ~ +1 ~ Weapon.Legendary Item																													QUALITY:Aura|strong abjuration	QUALITY:Caster Level|20th	QUALITY:Slot|none																																																																DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:Radiance was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert. When handled by a paladin, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a +1 cold iron longsword that radiates light as a torch on command. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the paladin's deity's favored weapon (in the hands of a paladin who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains a +1 longsword). Certain events and tasks can awaken Radiance's latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger--these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur.&nl;In addition, Radiance is a legendary item that bonds with a mythic paladin as soon as it is wielded in combat--in this adventure, Radiance bonds if a paladin uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that recharge each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic paladin. As Radiance has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.	INFO:Destruction|A paladin must knowingly slay an angel with the blade, at which point the sword can be destroyed normally with damage.

This weapon functions as a +1 ranseur that grants a +4 bonus on disarm checks rather than the typical +2 bonus a ranseur grants. Up to 5 times per day as a swift action, the wielder of a ranseur of the gargoyle can cause its skin to harden for 1 round, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor score.

A pillar of roiling clouds rises below the levitating object or creature, growing and shrinking with the target's altitude.

Wardstone Shard									KEY:Wardstone Shard										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Minor.Artifact		COST:0	WT:0.5																							SOURCEPAGE:p.65																						QUALITY:Aura|strong abjuration	QUALITY:Caster Level|20th	QUALITY:Slot|none																																																																DESC:When the final fragment of the Kenabres wardstone shatters, a few tiny shards of the stone remain behind. The magic remaining in these fragments is fleeting, usable only once before the shard becomes an inert sliver of stone. As a standard action, a wardstone shard may be rubbed along a weapon or a suit of armor to transfer the shard's magic to the weapon or armor for 1 day.&nl;Weapon: A weapon enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the evil outsider bane quality, and is treated as being made of cold iron and as a good weapon for the purposes of overcoming a demon's damage reduction. The shard cannot be used to enhance ammunition in this manner, but can be used to enhance a weapon that fires ammunition; doing so causes the weapon to impart these qualities to the ammunition as it is fired.&nl;Armor: A suit of armor enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the spell resistance (13) armor special ability, but only against evil outsiders. Against demons, this spell resistance increases to 17. A nonmagical suit of armor also gains a +1 enhancement bonus as well.
