Alabaster Outcast		KEY:Trait ~ Alabaster Outcast								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Alabaster Outcast],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]											DESC:You are a member of one of Magnimar's wealthiest families... or rather, you used to be. A falling-out left you disowned and disinherited. Now you hope to get away from the city and find fortune enough to shame your former kinsfolk--goals which led you to the Pathfinder Society. Despite your exile, your name still carries considerable weight in Magnimar, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made within the city. Additionally, you start play with a noble's outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. Your last name is probably Derexhi, Kaddren, Mindurian, Niroden, Scarnetti, Valdemar, Vanderale, or Versade (but may be another of your choosing; see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments).

The Pathfinder Society in particular recognized your wanderlust and potential as an agent, and on more than one occasion you impressed or bamboozled their agents with your street smarts and finesse. Over the years, you fell out of favor with the Sczarni, and eventually left to pursue interests outside of simple banditry, though you still remember the lessons your criminal relations taught you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to pass hidden messages. Also, anytime you deliver a coup de grace, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.

Your fascination with these relics has only grown in the years since, encouraging you to join the ranks of the Pathfinder Society so you can further quench your thirst for knowledge. Though you know little about the actual lore of the monuments, you've studied these colossal works extensively, developing an in-depth knowledge of some of the city's most famous landmarks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) checks made in Varisia due to your familiarity with its historical remnants. This bonus increases to +2 if the check relates to the city of Magnimar.
