DESC:The Shattered Star Player's Guide gives players all the spoiler-free information, inspiration, and new rules they'll need to create characters prepared for delving into the adventure and intrigue of the Shattered Star Adventure Path. Within, players of this campaign will find everything they need to create character backgrounds tied to personalities and events vital to Pathfinder Adventure Path's exploration of some of the many ancient dungeons spread throughout Varisia, along with new campaign-specific traits to give bold adventurers the edge they'll need to take on the strange and deadly threats faced in these dark places. This player's guide also features a view of Magnimar at a glance, and an introduction to the Pathfinder Society, including rewards and resources of the organization.
