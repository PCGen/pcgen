Bastard					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bastard],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		PRERACE:1,Human,RACESUBTYPE=Human	DESC:One of your parents was a member of one of the great families of Brevoy, perhaps even of the line of Rogarvia itself. Yet you have no substantive proof of your nobility, and you've learned that claiming nobility without evidence makes you as good as a liar. While you might own a piece of jewelry, a scrap of once-rich fabric, or an aged confession of love, none of this directly supports your claim. Thus, you've lived your life in the shadow of nobility, knowing that you deserve the comforts and esteem of the elite, even though the contempt of fate brings you nothing but their scorn. Whether a recent attempt to prove your heritage has brought down the wrath of a noble family's henchmen or you merely seek to prove the worth of the blood in your veins, you've joined an expedition into the Stolen Lands, hoping to make a name all your own. You take a -1 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks made when dealing with members of Brevic nobility. (The penalty aspect of this trait is removed if you ever manage to establish yourself as a true noble.)																									BONUS:SAVE|Will|1|TYPE=Trait																								SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Brigand					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Brigand],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]								DESC:You hail from the River Kingdoms or the more lawless reaches of Brevoy. Life has been hard for you. Perhaps your parents and siblings were crooks and con artists, or maybe your rough, lonely life lead you to fall in with thieves and worse. You know how to ambush travelers, bully traders, avoid the law, and camp where no one might find you. Recently, you've run into some trouble, either with the law or with other bandits, and you're looking to get away to somewhere no one would ever think to look for you. An expedition into the rugged wilderness seems like a perfect way to lie low until the trouble blows over. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks when dealing with brigands, thieves, bandits, and their ilk.

Issian		NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Issian],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]								DESC:You were raised northern Brevoy, a land of misty shores and harsh hill lands, of snowy vistas and violet-hued mountains. You are descended from an able and intelligent people, and you have grand ambitions, a mind alert for opportunity, and the tenacity to fight for your goals no matter the challenge. You care for little more than achieving your aspirations and opportunities to win wealthy and grandeur, for which few costs prove too great. You see yourself as a citizen of Brevoy through and through. The call for champions willing to help take back your country's rightful holdings in the Stolen Lands has inflamed your dreams of profit and possibilities, so you have joined an expedition to quest south. Your agile mind grants you a +1 trait bonus on all Will saves made to resist mind-affecting effects.																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.10	ASPECT:SaveBonus|+1 trait bonus on Will saves vs. mind-affecting effects
Noble Born					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Noble Born],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]							DESC:You claim a tangential but legitimate connection to one of Brevoy's noble families. If you aren't human, you were likely adopted by one of Brevoy's nobles or were instead a favored servant or even a childhood friend of a noble scion. Whatever the cause, you've had a comfortable life, but one far from the dignity and decadence your distant cousins know. Although you are associated with an esteemed name, your immediate family is hardly well to do, and you've found your name to be more of a burden to you than a boon in many social situations. You've recently decided to test yourself, to see if you can face the world without the aegis of a name you have little real claim or care for. An expedition into the storied Stolen Lands seems like just the test to see if you really are worth the title "noble."

Pioneer					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Pioneer],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]								DESC:You have long lived along the southern border of Brevoy, in the shadow of wilderness known as the Stolen Lands. Life has been hard, but through hunting, trapping, trading, and coaxing crops from the freezing earth, you've learned how to survive on the rugged frontier. With the wilderness ever at your door, you've also learned much about its denizens and the wild creatures that lurk in that unwholesome land. Your family might even claim holdings in the Stolen Lands, with elders telling stories of being driven from or robbed of a lost ancestral homestead, fertile farmlands, bountiful orchards, or a hidden mining claim. Whether because of your personal expertise and familiarity with the borderlands or in order to reclaim your family's land, you've joined the expedition into the Stolen Lands. You begin play with a horse.

Rostlander		NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rostlander],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]							DESC:You were raised in the south of Brevoy, a land of dense forests and rolling plains, of crystalline rivers and endless sapphire skies. You come from hearty stock and were raised with simple sensibilities of hard work winning well deserved gains, the importance of charity and compassion, and the value of personal and familial honor. Yours is the country of the Aldori swordlords and the heroes who refused to bend before the armies of a violent conqueror. You care little for matters of politics and nobles or of deception and schemes. As you are thoroughly Brevic, the call for champions willing to expand your land's influence into the Stolen Lands has inflamed your sense of patriotism and honor, and so you have joined an expedition to quest southward.																																																																												BONUS:SAVE|Fortitude|1|TYPE=Trait																							SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Sword Scion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Sword Scion],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]							DESC:You have lived all your life in and around the city of Restov, growing up on tales of Baron Sirian Aldori and the exploits of your home city's heroic and legendary swordlords. Perhaps one of your family members was an Aldori swordlord, you have a contact among their members, or you have dreamed since childhood of joining. Regardless, you idolize the heroes, styles, and philosophies of the Aldori and have sought to mimic their vaunted art. Before you can petition to join their ranks, however, you feel that you must test your mettle. Joining an expedition into the Stolen Lands seems like a perfect way to improve your skills and begin a legend comparable to that of Baron Aldori. You begin play with a longsword or Aldori dueling sword and gain a +1 trait bonus on all attacks and combat maneuvers made with such weapons.
