Bonded witches forsake familiars as vessels of power in favor of a specific object that grants them powers above and beyond those of their patron alone, as they tap into the powerful magic of the item itself.

Ice Magic		KEY:Winter Witch ~ Ice Magic		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																																DESC:When a winter witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A winter witch cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor at all.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Cold Flesh		KEY:Winter Witch ~ Cold Flesh		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																														DESC:At 1st level, a winter witch gains endure elements as a constant spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. At 9th-level, this increases to cold resistance 10, and at 14th level, it becomes immunity to cold. This replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.11

# Winter Witch Archetype Specific Hexes
Frostfoot		KEY:Witch Hex ~ Frostfoot		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchHex.MinorHex.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Witch Archetype ~ Winter Witch																													PREVARGTEQ:WitchHexAbilityLVL,1	DESC:This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the witch climbs must be icy. The witch can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. She can move across regular snow without penalty, and heavy snow costs her only 2 squares of movement instead of 4.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Frozen Caress	KEY:Witch Hex ~ Frozen Caress		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WitchHex.MinorHex.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Witch Archetype ~ Winter Witch																													PREVARGTEQ:WitchHexAbilityLVL,1	DESC:Whenever the winter witch casts a touch spell, she can infuse the magic with cold as a swift action. This grants the spell the cold descriptor, and adds 1d4 points of cold damage to the spell's effect. If the touch spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates this additional cold damage.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.11



###Block: Winter Witch PRESTIGE CLASS
# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type												Var. Min. Value				Description																																																																																																																																																	Source Page
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Winter Witch ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Special.ClassFeatures							DESC:A winter witch gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Spells per Day			KEY:Winter Witch ~ Spells per Day			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											DESC:At the indicated levels, a winter witch gains new spells per day and patron spells as if she had also gained a level in the witch class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained except for additional spells per day and an increased effective level of spellcasting.																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Hyperboreal Patronage		KEY:Winter Witch ~ Hyperboreal Patronage		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											DESC:A winter witch's patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the listed class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd-wall of ice, 5th-icy prisonUM, 7th-freezing sphere.																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Winter Witchcraft			KEY:Winter Witch ~ Winter Witchcraft		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											DESC:Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch levels for determining when a witch learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her witch's familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Freeze and Thaw			KEY:Winter Witch ~ Freeze and Thaw			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or a 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10%% of the snow's volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it's helpless. This ability cannot affect water that is within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds. This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Unnatural Cold			KEY:Winter Witch ~ Unnatural Cold			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold resistance when determining the damage dealt.																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Sculpt Ice and Snow		KEY:Winter Witch ~ Sculpt Ice and Snow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as stone shape, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the fabricate spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the fabricate version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.			SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Winter Hex				KEY:Winter Witch ~ Winter Hex				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality											DESC:Starting at 5th level, whenever a winter witch can choose a major hex, she must choose from the following hexes: ice tombUM, hoarfrostUM, numbing chill (see below). Once the winter witch has selected all three winter hexes, she may thereafter choose any other hex she meets the prerequisites for.																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Blizzard Sight			KEY:Winter Witch ~ Blizzard Sight			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 6th level, a winter witch can see normally in natural or magical rain, sleet, hail, fog, snowstorms, blizzards, and similar weather conditions.																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Unearthly Cold			KEY:Winter Witch ~ Unearthly Cold			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 8th level, a winter witch's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that deal cold damage become horrendously cold. Half the cold damage caused by these effects comes from an otherworldly power and is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based attacks.																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Iceglide				KEY:Winter Witch ~ Iceglide				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 10th level, a winter witch can move effortlessly at her base land speed through ice or snow. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and doesn't create any ripple or other sign of passage. While icegliding, a winter witch can breathe normally. A control water spell cast on an area containing an icegliding winter witch flings her back 30 feet in a random direction, stunning her for 1 round unless she succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. A winter witch can use this ability for 10 minutes per day. This time need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Activating this ability is a swift action.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.13
Inexorable Cold			KEY:Winter Witch ~ Inexorable Cold			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.WinterWitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 10th level, a winter witch casts spells with the cold descriptor at +1 caster level. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to counterspell, dispel, or penetrate spell resistance with these spells, and the DC to counterspell or dispel these spells increases by 1.																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.14

#MAJOR HEX!
Numbing Chill			KEY:Witch Hex ~ Numbing Chill				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.WitchHex.MajorHex.SpecialQuality				PREVARGTEQ:WitchHexAbilityLVL,10	DESC:Whenever the winter witch casts a spell that deals cold damage, she can imbue the spell with a debilitating eldritch chill as a swift action. She chooses one of the spell's targets or a creature within the spell effect. If that creature takes cold damage from the spell, it must also succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and be staggered for 1 round. The creature need only make this saving throw once per spell, even if the spell deals damage multiple times. If the target saves successfully, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.13
