Drug Addict (Addicted Friend)			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drug Addict (Addicted Friend)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]
Drug Addict (Personal Addiction)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drug Addict (Personal Addiction)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:You were once addicted to shiver, a drug distilled from the venom of dream spiders. The drug induces sleep filled with vivid dreams, during which the user's body often shakes and shivers, giving the substance its street name. Shiver is particularly dangerous for the desperate, for its promises of dreams and oblivion are often viewed as the only alternative apart from suicide for escaping a dreary life. You've always thought of shiver as a problem of the lower class, but then you a crimelord named Gaedren got you addicted, and you overdosed on the stuff. You blame Gaedren for your brush with death and hate how his drugs are causing similar problems among other youths. Unfortunately, the guards seem to be more focused on the bigger dealers. They don't have time to devote many resources to what they've called, "a bit player in a beggar's problem." It would seem that if his operation is to be stopped, it falls to you. Fortunately, your body recovers quickly from toxins, and you have a +1 bonus on Fortitude saving throws.		BONUS:CHECKS|Fortitude|1|TYPE=Trait												SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Framed (Dropout)					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Framed (Dropout)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]
Framed (Family Honor)				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Framed (Family Honor)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]				DESC:A family member, perhaps a father or brother, was accused of murder. A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed to be enough to seal the case, but the accused had enough alibis that sentencing wasn't immediate. You managed to trick the fisherman into revealing the truth with your skilled tongue and discovered he was intimidated into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the actual murderer - a local crimelord named Gaedren Lamm. Lamm's thugs killed the fisherman before he could recant his testimony. Although this removed the key witness and resulted in the accused being set free, the stigma was enough to badly damage his reputation. If you can find Gaedren, you're sure you can find evidence that ties him to the murder and can clear the accused's name. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is always considered a class skill for you.																												BONUS:SKILL|Bluff|2|TYPE=Trait	CSKILL:Bluff			SOURCEPAGE:p.15

Love Lost (Widowed)				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Love Lost (Widowed)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]
Missing Child (Missing Sibling)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Missing Child (Missing Sibling)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:You suspect that you brother or sister has been abducted by Gaedren. You've heard rumors about Gaedren's "Little Lamms," and of how the old man uses children as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. You've even heard rumors that your sibling has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of other known to be cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the Korvosan Guard has been understanding of your plight, yet it has its hands full with "more important" matters these days, it seems, and has not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren. No one else is interested in bringing Gaedren down and rescuing his victims - that task falls to you. Yet where could the old scoundrel be hiding?  Although everyone else has given up hope, you believe your sibling still lives out there. Your constant search for the missing sibling has developed into great skill at rumor mongering and finding information from others. Diplomacy and Sense Motive are class skills for you.																							CSKILL:Diplomacy|Sense Motive	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Missing Child (Missing Son or Daughter)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Missing Child (Missing Son or Daughter)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]
Unhappy Childhood (Religious)			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Unhappy Childhood (Religious)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:You spent a period of time as one of Gaedren's enslaved orphans. Maybe you were abducted from your parent's home or during a trip to the market. Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your orphanage traded you to him in return for a desperately needed loan of money. Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren's slaves, were merely a child of the street who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he said would be "a little light work." Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of his "Little Lamms" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge for the old man ever since. You found a holy symbol of the god you worship today while on a job for Gaedren and, intrigued by it, you snuck off to attend services. When Gaedren found out, he beat you to within an inch of your life and broke your holy symbol. Your faith let you block out the pain, and you escaped his control and took shelter in the church, where you spent the rest of your youth. You gain a +2 bonus on Concentration checks.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BONUS:CONCENTRATION|ALLSPELLS|2|TYPE=Trait
