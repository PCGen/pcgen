Betrayed						KEY:Trait ~ Betrayed	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drug Addict (Addicted Friend)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]	DESC:You were hardly a model citizen as a child or young adult. Your reasons for turning to a life of crime may be varied, but what matters is that you eventually fell in with a certain well-connected and notorious crime lord named Gaedren Lamm. His reputation as a snake and a treacherous scoundrel was known to you, but for reasons of your own, you chose not to turn him down when he offered you a chance to work for him. You may have assumed you were an exception, or that you'd be able to handle him, or perhaps even planned to betray him. As it worked out, though, Gaedren got the upper hand and took you down you first. You may have served time in jail, may have been beaten by his thugs and left for dead, or could simply have had your profits stolen out from under you. Whatever the cause, Gaedren wronged you, and you are eager for the chance to get revenge.	MULT:YES	STACK:NO	CHOOSE:STRING|Hungry for Revenge|Reformed Criminal	DESC:&nl;Hungry for Revenge: You've never forgiven Gaedren for his betrayal, and have vowed to make him pay for what he did. Whether that's seeing him rot in jail or a shallow grave, you hope to taste vengeance someday. Whenever you deal damage with a melee weapon on a creature that is flat-footed, you gain a +1 trait bonus on the damage roll.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Betrayed (Hungry for Revenge)	DESC:&nl;Reformed Criminal: You've given up the life of crime, and managed to talk your way out of any repercussions such as jail time or fines. You've told yourself that you would rather leave your past behind, yet the concept of seeing Gaedren Lamm pay for his crimes still appeals to you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks, and Diplomacy is a class skill for you.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Betrayed (Reformed Criminal)	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Betrayed ~ Reformed Criminal|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Betrayed (Reformed Criminal)
Drug Addict (Addicted Friend)			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drug Addict (Addicted Friend)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:A friend or lover has become addicted to shiver, a drug distilled from the venom of dream spiders. The drug induces sleep filled with vivid dreams, during which the user's body often shakes and shivers, giving the substance its street name. Shiver is particularly dangerous for the desperate, for its promises of dreams and oblivion are often viewed as the only alternative apart from suicide for escaping a dreary life. You've always thought of shiver as a problem of the lower class, but then your friend overdosed on the stuff. You blame a crimelord named Gaedren for their brush with death. Unfortunately, the guards seem to be more focused on the bigger dealers. They don't have time to devote many resources to what they've called, "a bit player in a beggar's problem." It would seem that if his operation is to be stopped, it falls to you. Your research into the drug scene and local politics has given you a respectacble education in street knowledge. You gain a +2 trait bonus on either Knowledge (Local) checks or Diplomacy checks made to gather information.

Drug Addict (Personal Addiction)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drug Addict (Personal Addiction)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:You were once addicted to shiver, a drug distilled from the venom of dream spiders. The drug induces sleep filled with vivid dreams, during which the user's body often shakes and shivers, giving the substance its street name. Shiver is particularly dangerous for the desperate, for its promises of dreams and oblivion are often viewed as the only alternative apart from suicide for escaping a dreary life. You've always thought of shiver as a problem of the lower class, but then you a crimelord named Gaedren got you addicted, and you overdosed on the stuff. You blame Gaedren for your brush with death and hate how his drugs are causing similar problems among other youths. Unfortunately, the guards seem to be more focused on the bigger dealers. They don't have time to devote many resources to what they've called, "a bit player in a beggar's problem." It would seem that if his operation is to be stopped, it falls to you. Fortunately, your body recovers quickly from toxins, and you have a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws.																										BONUS:SAVE|Fortitude|1|TYPE=Trait												SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Framed (Dropout)					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Framed (Dropout)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]				DESC:You have been accused of murder. A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed to be enough to seal the case, but you had enough alibis that sentencing wasn't immediate.  Someone confronted the fisherman and discovered he was intimidated into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the actual murderer--a local crimelord named Gaedren Lamm. Lamm's thugs killed the fisherman before he could recant his testimony. Although this removed the key witness and resulted in your being set free, the stigma was enough to badly damage your reputation. You were forced to leave your school (perhaps the Acadamae) or church. As a result you were forced to self-train and promised yourself you would become better at your chosen profession despite the spurning of your peers. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Spellcraft checks. If you can find Gaedren, you're sure you can find evidence that ties him to the murder and can clear your name.

Framed (Family Honor)				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Framed (Family Honor)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]				DESC:A family member, perhaps a father or brother, was accused of murder. A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed to be enough to seal the case, but the accused had enough alibis that sentencing wasn't immediate. You managed to trick the fisherman into revealing the truth with your skilled tongue and discovered he was intimidated into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the actual murderer--a local crimelord named Gaedren Lamm. Lamm's thugs killed the fisherman before he could recant his testimony. Although this removed the key witness and resulted in the accused being set free, the stigma was enough to badly damage his reputation. If you can find Gaedren, you're sure you can find evidence that ties him to the murder and can clear the accused's name. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is always considered a class skill for you.

Love Lost (Orphaned)				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Love Lost (Orphaned)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]				DESC:Your only surviving parent was knifed to death in a dark alley one night. You were called to the scene by the Korvosan Guard to identify the body, and as rough as that was for you, you also noticed a ring was missing from the body. Whoever murdered your loved one stole that ring--you're convinced of it. You had to grow up fast to take care of your siblings or to handle your family's matters and were forced from an early age to support yourself. You gain a +2 trait bonus on one of the following skills: Craft, Perform, or Profession. You've done some investigation on your own and recently found the ring for sale at a local merchant. Although, to your great frustration, you can't afford yet to buy it back, the merchant did tell you from whom he purchased the ring: a man named Gaedren Lamm. It seems likely this criminal is the one who killed your loved one, or at the very least knows who did. The only problem is finding him.

Love Lost (Widowed)				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Love Lost (Widowed)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]				DESC:Your lover was knifed to death in a dark alley one night. You were called to the scene by the Korvosan Guard to identify the body, and as rough as that was for you, you also noticed a ring was missing from the body. Whoever murdered your loved one stole that ring--you're convinced of it. With your lover's death, a part of you died as well, leaving you haunted, grim, and prone to dark musings. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Intimidate checks. You've done some investigation on your own and recently found the ring for sale at a local merchant.

You've heard rumors about Gaedren's "Little Lamms," and of how the old man uses children as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. You've even heard rumors that your sibling has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of other known to be cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the Korvosan Guard has been understanding of your plight, yet it has its hands full with "more important" matters these days, it seems, and has not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren. No one else is interested in bringing Gaedren down and rescuing his victims - that task falls to you. Yet where could the old scoundrel be hiding?  Although everyone else has given up hope, you believe your sibling still lives out there. Your constant search for the missing sibling has developed into great skill at rumor mongering and finding information from others. Diplomacy and Sense Motive are class skills for you.																																																CSKILL:Diplomacy|Sense Motive	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Missing Child (Missing Son or Daughter)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Missing Child (Missing Son or Daughter)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]	DESC:You suspect that your own son or daughter, a niece or nephew, or the son or daughter of your superior or employer and one you had been charged with protecting has been abducted by Gaedren. You've heard rumors about Gaedren's "Little Lamms," and of how the old man uses children as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. You've even heard rumors that your sibling has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of other known to be cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the Korvosan Guard has been understanding of your plight, yet it has its hands full with "more important" matters these days, it seems, and has not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren.

Maybe you were abducted from your parent's home or during a trip to the market. Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your orphanage traded you to him in return for a desperately needed loan of money. Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren's slaves, were merely a child of the street who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he said would be "a little light work." Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of his "Little Lamms" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge for the old man ever since. You found a holy symbol of the god you worship today while on a job for Gaedren and, intrigued by it, you snuck off to attend services. When Gaedren found out, he beat you to within an inch of your life and broke your holy symbol. Your faith let you block out the pain, and you escaped his control and took shelter in the church, where you spent the rest of your youth. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Concentration checks.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BONUS:CONCENTRATION|ALLSPELLS|2|TYPE=Trait
Unhappy Childhood (Tortured)			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Unhappy Childhood (Tortured)],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:You spent a period of time as one of Gaedren's enslaved orphans.

Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of his "Little Lamms" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge for the old man ever since. Gaedren tortured you and left you for dead on a garbage heap after you made one too many errors. Your scars and memories have honed your reaction speed and make you rather jumpy.
