###Block: Nosferatu Defensive Abilities
Defensive Abilities	KEY:Nosferatu Defensive Abilities	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A nosferatu gains channel resistance +4 and DR 5/wood and piercing (this includes all wood-shafted weapons such as arrows, crossbow bolts, spears, and javelins, even if the weapon's actual head is made of another material). It also gains resistance 10 to cold, electricity, and sonic.&nl; A nosferatu gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a nosferatu assumes its swarm form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin within 1 hour or be utterly destroyed. (In swarm form, it can normally travel up to 5 miles in 1 hour.) Additional damage dealt to a nosferatu forced into swarm form has no effect. Once at rest, the nosferatu is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.

###Block: Nosferatu Weaknesses
Vampire Weaknesses	KEY:Nosferatu Weaknesses		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Weakness				DESC:A nosferatu can't tolerate the strong odor of garlic, and won't enter an area laced with it. Similarly, it recoils from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the nosferatu--they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling nosferatu must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and can't touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a nosferatu at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a nosferatu can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save.&nl;A nosferatu cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so.&nl;Reducing a nosferatu's hit points to 0 incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay nosferatu. Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water deals an amount of damage to a nosferatu equal to one-third of its full normal hit points--a nosferatu reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless nosferatu's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless its head is also severed and anointed with holy water.	SOURCEPAGE:p.269

###Block: Nosferatu Special Attacks
Blood Drain			KEY:Nosferatu Blood Drain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption	DESC:A nosferatu can suck blood from a helpless, willing, or grappled living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, draining 1d4 points of Constitution and Wisdom each round the pin is maintained. On each round it drains blood, the nosferatu gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points).				SOURCEPAGE:p.269
Dominate			KEY:Nosferatu Dominate			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.AttackOption	DESC:A nosferatu can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the nosferatu targets must succeed at a Will save or fall instantly under the nosferatu's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). This ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some nosferatu (such as a very old one or with an unusually strong bloodline) might be able to affect different creature types with this power.		SOURCEPAGE:p.269
Telekinesis			KEY:Nosferatu Telekinesis		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DESC:As a standard action, a nosferatu can use telekinesis (caster level 12th).																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.269

###Block: Nosferatu Special Qualities
Spider Climb		KEY:Nosferatu Spider Climb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A nosferatu can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell.																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.269
Swarm Form			KEY:Nosferatu Swarm Form		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The nosferatu gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm it has transformed into. The swarm has the same number of hit points as the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu can't use its claw attacks or any of its special attacks. It retains the defensive abilities, weaknesses, and special qualities it gains from being a nosferatu, counts as an undead creature, and can use any of the swarm's abilities and defenses. It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another form or until the next sunrise.	SOURCEPAGE:p.269
Telepathy			KEY:Nosferatu Telepathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A nosferatu can communicate telepathically with any creature within 60 feet that speaks the same language it does. In addition, a nosferatu can use this ability to communicate with any animal, magical beast, or vermin.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.269
