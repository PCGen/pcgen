Extract Knowledge			TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Necromancy		COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 full-round action	RANGE:touch	TARGETAREA:one disembodied brain touched					DURATION:instantaneous									SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	DESC:You touch the disembodied brain of the corpse of any sentient being and instantly know details related to one specific person, place, or thing as the subject knew them in life. This applies only to information directly related to the particular subject at hand. For example, if the target is an aboleth's brain and the subject is its lair, you could get directions to the lair and a list of contents inside the lair. However, it will not convey things about the lair that the aboleth did not know, or about any hazards along the way, or what the contents in the lair are used for. After the application of this spell, the brain melts away into useless goo. Access to the information gained through this spell fades from the caster's mind after 24 hours.

First, against attacks made by aberrations, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Next, the subject becomes immune to any effects caused by an aberration that can be removed by remove disease or remove curse. Lastly, the subject immediately receives another save against spells or effects originating from an aberration that attempts to gain mental control over the creature, with a +2 moral bonus.

All creatures and objects within that square at the conclusion of the casting of this spell are instantly transferred to a temporary extradimensional space in which time does not pass. Creatures or objects that are only partially within the space are not transferred. Once the spell ends, the extradimensional space disappears, and any creatures or objects in the extradimensional space appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the original square exactly the same as when they left. You cannot dismiss this spell once it has been cast.																									FACT:CompMaterial|(multicolored sand)
