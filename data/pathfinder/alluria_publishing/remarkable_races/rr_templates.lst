Boggle Madness														TYPE:Disease	DESC:Type disease, inherited; Save Will DC 16; Onset venerable age; Frequency 1/hour Effect 1d4 Wisdom damage, if more than 2 Wisdom damage, the target must make an addition Will save or he will lose control and must attack the nearest mobile creature or object; Cure none Special Boggle Madness is a genetic condition that all boggles have. Symptoms do not typically appear until the boggle is of venerable age. It cannot be passed on to a non-boggle, and even goblins are immune. The disease cannot be completely cured, magically or otherwise. Instead, any effect that would remove disease removes only the symptoms for 24 hours.
