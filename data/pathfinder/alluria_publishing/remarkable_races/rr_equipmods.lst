# Modifier Name								Unique Key							Type		Plus		Visible		Source Page		Required Type		Special Property
Boggle Brew									KEY:Special Quality ~ Boggle Brew							VISIBLE:NO									SPROP:This small vial of bright green bubbly and bitter solution prevents older boggles from entering a murderous rampage. After imbibing one dose of this solution, a boggle is immune to the symptoms of Boggle Madness for 24 hours. This does not prevent further mind-altering effects. This potion has no effect on non-boggles. Boggles rarely drink this concoction straight, as it is quite bitter and unpalatable. Often, the brew is mixed with some other drink or added to food. Boggles will often purchase or create large quantities of this substance at one time; keeping it in bottles or even small casks. To create boggle brew, it requires a Craft (alchemy) skill check, DC 20.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
