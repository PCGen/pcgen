To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in Crafting and have the Alchemical Crafting feat. You can then use the stoneâ€™s quicksilver for one of two effects: &nl;-You can apply the stoneâ€™s quicksilver to an infused true elixir of life using an Interact action. This turns the elixir into an infused elixir of rejuvenation instantaneously. This doesnâ€™t require any crafting time or additional materials. &nl;-You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold.
