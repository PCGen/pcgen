# Ability Name				Source Page		Category of Ability	Type			Description
Aspis Consortium				SOURCEPAGE:435	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:The sprawling mercantile concern known as the Aspis Consortium is structured to ensure that the survival of the faction is more important than any single member. Originally founded as a private trading endeavor, the Consortium has grown to be one of the largest business ventures in the Inner Sea region. Most of the group's members are skilled merchants and mercenaries, and the organization has made a merciless and bloodthirsty name for itself when it comes to ensuring its profits. The Aspis Consortium has clashed many times with the Pathfinder Society.
Bellflower Network			SOURCEPAGE:435	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:The unsavory practice of slavery continues to be a strong economic force in diabolic Cheliax. Here, halflings are particularly valued as slaves, for they work hard and take up only half the room of a human laborer. It should come as no surprise, then, to learn of the Bellflower Network, an organization founded by halfling freedom fighters that accepts any into its ranks, provided they aid the network in its goal of freeing all slaves from servitude and helping them escape from oppressive lands like Cheliax.
Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye	SOURCEPAGE:435	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:Based in the nation of Ustalav, the scholars and philosophers of this semisecret society have long stood against the Whispering Way (page 441), but more recent events have placed them in opposition to the sinister goals of the Night Heralds. When left to their own devices, however, members of this faction prefer to explore and study dusty secrets hidden in the past, particularly those still awaiting rediscovery in the regions of the Golden Road-especially in the nation of Osirion.
Eagle Knights				SOURCEPAGE:435	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:The Eagle Knights are the protectors and defenders of the people of Andoran. The group itself consists of four subfactions- the Steel Falcons (who protect Andoran's interests beyond its borders), the Golden Legion (Andoran's defenders and the commanders of its armies), the Gray Corsairs (nautical agents who specialize in fighting the slave trade), and the Twilight Talons (spies and deep cover agents).
Firebrands					SOURCEPAGE:435	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:Not all factions have central bases of operation or organized hierarchies of command. The loosely affiliated freedom fighters, swashbuckling heroes, and entertainers known as the Firebrands are one such group. They are united by a desire to fight oppression, oppose tyrannical regimes, free slaves, rescue the wrongfully accused, and engage in jolly cooperation with like-minded heroes-all while building their own individual reputations and wealth. This group of defenders has proven surprisingly difficult for oppressive governments and cruel religions to defeat.
Free Captains				SOURCEPAGE:435	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:To an outside observer or a merchant whose ship has been looted or sunk, the pirates of the Shackles may seem like a disorganized scourge. But in truth, these pirates are bound by a complex code of, if not honor, then a mutual recognition that it's always good to have allies on the open seas. The Shackles are ruled by a council of pirate lords who call themselves the Free Captains; they sail the southern Arcadian Ocean and follow their own code of rules when it comes to who can be raided and what can be sunk-even if, to their victims, those rules seem capricious and arbitrary.
Hellknights					SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:Several different orders of the mercenaries known collectively as Hellknights operate in Avistan, with most of their number stationed in the nation of Cheliax. These mercenaries see the law of the land as inviolate and offer their services as enforcers to any who can pay their prices. They wear distinctive suits of intimidating armor and take the legends of Hell as inspiration, but they see no one but themselves as the true arbiters of law.
Knights of Lastwall			SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:For centuries, the nation of Lastwall stood as a bulwark against the orcs of Belkzen and the lingering threat of the Whispering Tyrant. But when the Whispering Tyrant escaped his prison, he brought to his enemies in Lastwall a devastating apocalypse. Now Lastwall is destroyed, and the knights who once served there are without a home. In its absence, they have formed a ragtag group known as the Knights of Lastwall, and they carry on their charge to stand against the undead legions of the Whispering Tyrant wherever their skills are needed.
Lion Blades					SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:The Lion Blades of Taldor are a secret organization committed to protecting the interests of Taldor and its ruler. They oppose Taldor's many enemies, foreign and domestic, through a program of infiltration, espionage, and assassination. One of the major goals of the Lion Blades is to rein in corruption within the empire (aside from corruption that is useful to them); another is keeping any one faction of the imperial court from becoming powerful enough to upset the status quo. Through its shadow schools, the Lion Blades intensively train new recruits before investing them with a high degree of initiative and latitude.
Magaambya					SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:Golarion reeled from the disaster of Earthfall, and its peoples took long to recover. But recover they did, and one of the first institutions to rise from the ashes of near destruction was the Magaambya, an academy of arcane learning founded by the legendary wizard known as Old- Mage Jatembe. Today, the scholars of Magaambya not only preserve ancient magical traditions founded in those early days but also protect the learning and culture of the Mwangi people as a whole.
Night Heralds				SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:The Night Heralds turn to the lure of the starlit night for guidance, seeking advice and aid from forces far removed from Golarion. The sinister aliens of the Dominion of the Black hold special importance for the Night Heralds, and many Night Heralds worship these inscrutable beings almost as gods. Night Heralds seek and collect obscure texts and mysterious lore from the ancient past and peruse the secrets they find within to unravel larger hidden meanings and obscured truths beyond reality. Their hope is that when the world inevitably falls to alien influence, they will be rewarded for their service by the world's new masters.
Pathfinder Society			SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:Many of the greatest explorers and adventurers of the modern age have recorded their discoveries in an ongoing series of chapbooks known as the Pathfinder Chronicles, published irregularly by the Pathfinder Society itself. This diverse group is devoted to exploring the world, supporting its agents in the field, and ensuring the discoveries they make are documented. The Society often finds itself in conflict with the more mercenary Aspis Consortium. The Pathfinder Society's pursuit of discovery often puts its agents in the thick of developing plots, forcing them to choose between being heroes or villains as events unfold.
Red Mantis					SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:It's easy to know if an assassination is the work of the notorious Red Mantis; they typically kill with a sacred sawtooth saber, have a knack for targeting their victims in public or in sanctuaries believed to be safe, and take steps to ensure that those they are contracted to kill stay dead. Their prices change with each mission, but no matter the offer, the Red Mantis never targets rightfully ruling monarchs, for their own deity, the mantis god Achaekek, forbids the murder of those with a divine mandate to rule.
Sczarni					SOURCEPAGE:436	CATEGORY:Faction		TYPE:Faction	DESC:The Sczarni are a collection of Varisian bandits, smugglers, and thieves. They are organized into tightly knit families, each of which has little or nothing in common with Sczarni in other locations beyond shared skills, techniques, and pursuits. Their crimes focus on thievery, scams, and other relatively nonviolent acts, but since these crimes have a tendency to spiral out of control, their schemes often result in violence anyway.
