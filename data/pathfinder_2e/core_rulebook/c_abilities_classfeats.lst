For instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four. This does not reduce the amount of alchemical reagents required or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch using advanced alchemy.

When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect. For example, you can combine two elixirs of life to create a combined elixir that heals twice the normal amount, or you can combine a lesser darkvision elixir with a lesser eagle-eye elixir to both gain darkvision and find secret doors.

Clever Counterspell				KEY:Wizard Feat ~ Clever Counterspell		SOURCEPAGE:p.212	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Wizard Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 12.WIZARD						PREVARGTEQ:WizardCL,12	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=12			PRETEXT:Prerequisites Counterspell, Quick Recognize			DESC:You creatively apply your prepared spells to Counterspell a much wider variety of your opponents' magic. Instead of being able to counter a foe's spell with Counterspell only if you have that same spell prepared, you can use Counterspell as long as you have the spell the foe is casting in your spellbook. When you use Counterspell in this way, the prepared spell you expend must share a trait other than its tradition with the triggering spell. At the GM's discretion, you can instead use a spell that has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter the triggering spell (such as using a cold or water spell to counter fireball or using remove fear to counter a fear spell). Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a -2 penalty to your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if the expended spell is especially appropriate.
Magic Sense						KEY:Wizard Feat ~ Magic Sense				SOURCEPAGE:p.212	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Wizard Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 12.ARCANE.DETECTION.DIVINATION.WIZARD		PREVARGTEQ:WizardCL,12	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=12														DESC:You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.

You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.

The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.

Spell Tinker [Two-Actions]			KEY:Wizard Feat ~ Spell Tinker			SOURCEPAGE:p.213	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Wizard Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 16.CONCENTRATE.WIZARD				PREVARGTEQ:WizardCL,16	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=16														DESC:You've learned to alter choices you make when casting spells on yourself. After casting a spell on only yourself that offers several choices of effect (such as resist energy, spell immunity, or a polymorph spell that offers several potential forms), you can alter the choice you made when Casting the Spell (for instance, choosing a different type of damage for resist energy). However, your tinkering weakens the spell's integrity, reducing its remaining duration by half. You can't use this feat if the benefits of the spell have already been used up or if the effects of the first choice would persist in any way after switching (for instance, if one of the choices was to create a consumable item you already used, or to heal you), or if the feat would create an effect more powerful than that offered by the base spell. The GM is the final arbiter of what Spell Tinker can be applied to.
Infinite Possibilities				KEY:Wizard Feat ~ Infinite Possibilities		SOURCEPAGE:p.213	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Wizard Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 18.WIZARD						PREVARGTEQ:WizardCL,18	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=18														DESC:You've found a way to prepare a spell slot that exists in your mind as many different possibilities at once. Once during your daily preparations, you can use a spell slot to hold that infinite potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. You can use this spell slot to cast any spell from your spellbook that's at least 2 levels lower than the slot you designate; the spell acts in all ways as a spell of 2 levels lower. You don't have any particular spell prepared in that slot until you cast it.

You can spend 10 minutes to prepare a spell that you already cast today, regaining access to that spell slot. The spell must be of 4th level or lower and one that does not have a duration. You can reprepare a spell in this way even if you've already reprepared that spell previously in the same day. If you have the spell substitution arcane thesis, you can instead prepare a different spell in an expended slot, as long as the new spell doesn't have a duration. Once you've reprepared a spell in that slot even once, you can use your arcane thesis to substitute only spells without durations into that spell slot.
Archwizard's Might				KEY:Wizard Feat ~ Archwizard's Might		SOURCEPAGE:p.213	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Wizard Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 20.WIZARD						PREVARGTEQ:WizardCL,20	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=20			PRETEXT:Prerequisites archwizard's spellcraft				DESC:You have mastered the greatest secrets of arcane magic.

Spell Combination					KEY:Wizard Feat ~ Spell Combination			SOURCEPAGE:p.213	CATEGORY:CLASS FEAT	TYPE:Wizard Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 20.WIZARD						PREVARGTEQ:WizardCL,20	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=20														DESC:You can merge spells, producing multiple effects with a single casting. One slot of each level of spell you can cast, except 2nd level and 1st level, becomes a spell combination slot (this doesn't apply to cantrips). When you prepare your spells, you can fill a combination slot with a combination of two spells. Each spell in the combination must be 2 or more spell levels below the slot's level, and both must target only one creature or object or have the option to target only one creature or object. Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of determining whether it has an effectboth spells must require a ranged spell attack roll, require the same type of saving throw, or automatically affect the target. When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target, even if the component spells normally affect more than one. If any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as targeting only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions. The combined spell uses the shorter of the component spells' ranges. Resolve a combined spell as if were a single spell, but apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the spell's target succeeded at the save against a combined spell, it would apply the success effect of each spell, and if it critically failed, it would apply the critical failure effect of both spells.
