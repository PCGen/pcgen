DESC:It exists inside of time and space. It is every time and every place at once. It is anchored in a sea of realities battling to assert themselves as the one true reality. Welcome to The City, the core of everything, the center of the Omniverse. Here, in a unique fluid and ever-changing role-playing game setting, mages and knights walk streets of lead and aluminum. Space-faring adventurers haggle with fantastic creatures over the price of rare gems. Cybernetic rogues hack into computer systems to get access to a temple's archives. The dead walk again as winged creatures descend from islands in the sky to learn from the most learned scholars. Steam-powered vehicles travel through the most difficult terrain, carrying gargoyles and aliens together to their final destination. Everything that can be, is, in The City. The gates stand open awaiting new visitors. Dare you venture inside?
