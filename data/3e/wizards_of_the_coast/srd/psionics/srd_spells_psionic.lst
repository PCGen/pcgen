###Block: FULL DESCRIPTIONS
# Spell Name					Description
Ablating.MOD					DESC:The manifester creates a psychokinetic shield around the subject that bolsters its powers' chance to survive a negate psionics power (or dispel magic spell). When ablating is manifested on a ? creature or object, add +6 to the DC of the negation check or dispel check for each ongoing power subject to negate psionics. Thus, the DC for each power check is equal to 11 + the power-to-be-negated's manifester level +6. Ablating ends when its duration expires or after a negate psionics is manifested on its subject. Negate psionics can negate ablating, but against a targeted negation, ablating is always checked last. Against an area negation, ablating is checked according to its level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Adamant Grasp.MOD					DESC:All the manifester's grapple checks receive a +10 competence bonus while the duration lasts.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Adapt Body.MOD					DESC:The manifester can adapt his or her body to hostile environments. The manifester chooses the environment at the time he or she manifests the power. The manifester can adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold, and even airless environments, allowing him or her to survive like a creature native to that environment, if any. The manifester can breathe and move, and takes no damage simply from being in that environment. The manifester can somewhat adapt to extreme environments such as acid, lava, fire, electricity, and other volatile areas. Any environment that normally directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per round is too extreme for this power (although it subtracts the first die of damage from the total dealt per round). An attack form does not constitute an environment.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Affinity Field.MOD				DESC:While the duration lasts, affected creatures feel all physical forces (damage and healing) that the manifester feels. Hit point gain or loss persists after this power ends. Creatures in range are also subject to magical and psionic effects of 3rd level or less, but all magic and psionic effects transferred to others fade at the end of this power's duration, although instantaneous effects remain|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Amplified Invisibility.MOD			DESC:The creature or object touched vanishes from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. If manifest on someone else, neither the manifester nor his or her allies can see the subject, unless the manifester can normally see invisible things or employ psionics to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so. Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from her becomes visible. The subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable. The power ends the second time the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this power, an "attack" includes any power targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not negate the power. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Note that powers that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. An invisible attacker gains a +2 bonus on his attack roll (for the two attacks, either melee or ranged, that are allowed before becoming visible), and the defender against such an attack loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anchored Navigation.MOD				DESC:While the duration lasts, the manifester is aware of his or her exact distance and route (physical or psychoportive) back to a fixed starting point. The manifester must designate the "anchored" starting point when first manifesting the power. To designate other anchored starting points, the manifester must manifest additional anchored navigation powers. This power also allows teleport to return the manifester to the fixed point with no chance of error. Moreover, this power allows normal telepathic communication (assuming the manifester has a power or ability that grants telepathic communication) with any receptive beings within a 60-foot radius of the fixed point, regardless of distance. Use of anchored navigation is confined to the plane of existence where it was manifest.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animal Affinity.MOD				DESC:The manifester forges a psychometabolic affinity with a chosen kind of animal ("animal" is a creature type), from which he or she emulates one ability score. The manifester can emulate only one ability score per manifestation of animal affinity, although multiple manifestations can affect the character, as long as each emulates different ability scores. Any of the six ability scores can be enhanced in this fashion. The manifester can increase his or her own ability score by a maximum of 1d4+1 points.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Apopsi.MOD						DESC:The manifester deletes 1d4 powers permanently from the subject's mind. The manifester specifies the level of each power, and the DM randomly determines which of the subject's powers is actually deleted. Psychic chirurgery may be used to restore the lost power, but it must be performed within 1 week of losing the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct I.MOD				DESC:This power creates one 1st-level astral construct of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn.  It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct II.MOD				DESC:This power creates one 2nd-level astral construct or 1d3 1st-level astral constructs of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn.  It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct III.MOD			DESC:This power creates one 3rd-level astral construct, 1d3 2nd-level astral constructs, or 1d4+1 1st-level astral constructs of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn. It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct IV.MOD				DESC:This power creates one 4th-level astral construct, 1d3 3rd-level astral constructs, or 1d4+1 astral constructs of lower level of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn. It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct V.MOD				DESC:This power creates one 5th-level astral construct, 1d3 4th-level astral constructs, or 1d4+1 astral constructs of lower level of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn. It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct VI.MOD				DESC:This power creates one 6th-level astral construct, 1d3 5th-level astral constructs, or 1d4+1 astral constructs of lower level of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn. It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct VII.MOD			DESC:This power creates one 7th-level astral construct, 1d3 6th-level astral constructs, or 1d4+1 astral constructs of lower level of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn. It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct VIII.MOD			DESC:This power creates one 8th-level astral construct, 1d3 7th-level astral constructs, or 1d4+1 astral constructs of lower level of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn. It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Construct IX.MOD				DESC:This power creates one 9th-level astral construct, 1d3 8th-level astral constructs, or 1d4+1 astral constructs of lower level of solidified ectoplasm that attacks the manifester's enemies. It appears where the manifester designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn. It attacks the manifester's opponents to the best of its ability. The manifester can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power and dissipates at the end of its turn. It is not necessary to learn a lower-level astral construct power before learning a higher-level version.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Projection (Psionics).MOD		DESC:This power allows the manifester to project an astral body into another plane altogether. The manifester can bring the astral forms of other creatures with him or her, provided the creatures are linked in a circle with the manifester at the time of the manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the manifester and must accompany him or her at all times. If something happens to the manifester during the journey, the companions are stranded wherever he or she left them. The manifester projects his or her astral self into the Astral Plane, leaving his or her physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The power projects an astral copy of the manifester and all he of she wears or carries onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon every other plane, the manifester can travel astrally to other planes. The manifester then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence he or she has chosen to enter. On the Astral Plane or any outer plane, the astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially. Very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the person's body where it rests on the Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. The manifester and companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Their bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until they choose to return their spirits to their physical bodies. The power lasts until the manifester desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as negate psionics manifested upon either the physical body or the astral form, or the destruction of the body back on the Material Plane (which kills the character).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Steed.MOD					DESC:The manifester calls a quasi-real, horselike creature from the Astral Plane. The steed can be ridden only by the manifester or by the one person for whom the manifester specifically calls the mount. An astral steed does not fight, but all normal animals shun it and refuse to attack it. The mount has an Armor Class of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per manifester level. If it loses all its hit points, the steed disappears. A astral steed has a speed of 20 feet per manifester level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per manifester level. These mounts gain certain powers according to manifester level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower manifester levels. 8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed. 10th Level: The mount can ride over water as if it were firm, dry ground. 12th Level: The mount can ride in the air as if it were firm land, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. The mount cannot simply take off and fly. It can only ride horizontally across the air. After 1 round in the air, the mount falls. 14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed. It has a maneuverability rating of average.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Attraction.MOD					DESC:The manifester plants a compelling attraction in the mind of the subject. The attraction can be toward a particular person, an object, an action, or an event. The power's subject will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend, find, or perform the object of its implanted attraction. For the purposes of this power, "reasonable" means that while fascinated, the subject doesn't suffer from blind obsession.  The subject can still recognize danger, but will not flee unless the threat is immediate. If the manifester makes the subject feel an attraction to the manifester, he or she can't command the subject indiscriminately, although he or she will be willing to listen to the manifester (even if the subject disagrees). This power grants the manifester a +4 bonus to his or herCharisma modifier when dealing with the subject.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Augury (Psionics).MOD				DESC:An augury can tell whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for the manifester in the immediate future. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%%, plus 1%% per manifester level; the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that the question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, the manifester gets one of four results: "Weal" (if the action will probably bring good results). "Woe" (for bad results). "Weal and woe" (for both). "Nothing" (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results). If the power fails, the manifester gets the "nothing" result. A psion who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it resulted from a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the augury. Thus, it might miss the long-term consequences of the contemplated action. All auguries manifested by the same person about the same action use the same die roll result as the first augury.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura Alteration.MOD				DESC:The manifester can disguise the subject's aura (alignment), level, or remove compulsions such as crisis of breath, fatal attraction, curses, geases, and quests. Aura alteration can also sever all charm and compulsion powers of 6th level or lower that might affect a target. If disguising the subject's alignment or level, the power has a duration of 10 minutes/level. The manifester may change the subject's alignment by only one degree. The manifester may adjust the subject's apparent level by a number equal to one-half the manifester's own level (rounded down). If attempting to cleanse the subject's aura, the duration is instantaneous. When aura alteration is manifested, the subject gains another saving throw against the affliction at the original DC, but with a +2 bonus on his or her roll. The manifester can remove the afflictions noted above, and may be able to remove others at the DM's discretion.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura Sight.MOD					DESC:The manifester discerns auras.  The amount of information revealed depends on how long the character studies a particular area. 1st round: Presence of good or evil auras in the area. The manifester can't pin an aura to a particular object or individual at this stage. 2nd round: Number of auras (creatures, objects, powers, or spells) in the area. 3rd round: The owner of each aura is revealed, unless the individual is somehow hidden. If the manifester's character level is 5 or more levels below a target's actual experience level or HD, the manifester is "overwhelmed" by its presence and stunned for 1 round, and the power ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aversion.MOD					DESC:The manifester plants a powerful aversion in the mind of the subject. The aversion can be toward a particular parson, an object, an action, or an event. The power's subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its implanted aversion. If a physical object, he or she will not approach within 30 feet of it. If a word, he or she will not utter or think it, if an action he or she will not perform it, and if an event he or she will not attend it. If not taking a taboo action directly threatens the subject, he or she may perform the action at a -2 morale penalty on any attack rolls, ability checks, or skill checks involved.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Baleful Teleport.MOD				DESC:The manifester psychoportively disperses minuscule portions of the subject, dealing 9d6 points of damage. Targets are protected from the effects of a baleful teleport by dimensional anchor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Banishment (Psionics).MOD			DESC:Banishment enables the manifester to force extraplanar creatures out of his or her home plane. Up to 2 HD of creatures per manifester level can be banished. To target a creature, the manifester must present at least one object or substance that it hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, he or she gains +1 on your manifester level check to overcome the target's PR (if any) and +2 on the saving throw DC. At the DM's option, certain rare items might work twice as well (+2 to penetrate resistance and +4 to the power's DC).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Biocurrent.MOD					DESC:The manifester's body produces an arc of electricity that targets a primary foe for 1d4 points of electricity damage per round that the character meets the requirements (see below). Electricity also arcs off the primary foe to strike one additional foe initially within 15 feet of the primary foe, or who subsequently moves within 15 feet of the primary foe while the duration lasts. Secondary foes also take 1d4 points of damage per round the duration lasts. Should either the primary or secondary foe fall to below 0 hit points, biocurrent's electrical arc random?ly retargets another primary and secondary foe while the duration continues. Targeted foes may move or make a saving throw each round for half damage (on that round only), but as long as they remain in range, they continue to be affected. Maintaining biocurrent is a full-round action (the manifester is limited to only 5-foot steps and no other actions). If the manifester takes damage while maintaining biocurrent, he or she must make a successful Concentration check. If any of these requirements are not met, the electrical arc winks out.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Biofeedback.MOD					DESC:The manifester takes a portion of any attack that deals damage as points of subdual damage equal to his or her Strength modifier. This power is not retroactive to wounds received prior to manifesting biofeedback.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Tiger.MOD				DESC:The power grants the manifester a bite attack (which does not draw an attack of opportunity) with a base damage of 2d8 points. This power can be used in conjunction with feats, powers, or spells allowing additional attacks in one round, and it can be used with multiple attacks gained through level advancement.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Wolf.MOD				DESC:The power grants the manifester a bite attack (which does not draw an attack of opportunity) with a base damage of 1d8 points. This power can be used in conjunction with feats, powers, or spells allowing additional attacks in one round, and it can be used with multiple attacks gained through level advancement.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body Adjustment.MOD				DESC:The manifester cures him or herself of 3d6 points of damage. Alternatively, the manifester can focus on a disease or poison. He or she must manifest body adjustment separately for each different condition. If used against a disease, the next daily Fortitude save to attempt to throw off the infection gains a bonus equal to 4 + the character's manifester level. If used against a poison, the secondary Fortitude save (usually made 1 minute after the first exposure to poison) gains a bonus equal to 4 + the character's manifester level. Multiple uses of body adjustment for use against poison or disease do not stack. Finally, a character can use body adjustment to heal 2 points of temporary ability damage. The manifester doesn't gain all three benefits from a single manifestation of this power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body Equilibrium.MOD				DESC:The manifester can adjust his or her body equilibrium to correspond with any solid or liquid that you stand on. Thus, he or she can walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider's web without sinking or breaking through (this does not con?fer any resistance to particularly sticky webs). The character can move at his or her normal speed, but cannot run (x4 speed) on an unfirm surface without sinking or breaking through. If the character falls while using this power, damage from the impact is halved.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bolt.MOD						DESC:The manifester creates a single, nonmagical, standard-size crossbow bolt, arrow, or sling bullet, which dissipates into its constituent ectoplasmic particles when the duration lapses.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Brain Lock.MOD					DESC:The subject stands mentally paralyzed, unable to take any actions. The brain locked subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage). He or she can defend against physical attacks (Dexterity bonus to AC still applies), but otherwise can't move, and can't use psionic powers. A brain locked flyer cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Breath of the Dragon.MOD			DESC:The manifester breathes forth fire, originating from his or her mouth and extending outward in a cone. This attack deals 11d4 points of fire damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Brilliant Blast.MOD				DESC:The manifester focuses ambient light into a blast dealing 9d4 points of heat damage to all creatures within the area. Unattended objects also take damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Burning Ray.MOD					DESC:A ray of burning ectoplasm projects from the manifester's brow. The manifester must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike a target with the ray, which deals 3d6 points of fire damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Burst.MOD						DESC:The subject receives a burst of speed. The subject has a speed equal to his or her original speed +10 on his or her next round of actions. A psionic character can manifest this power instantly on him or herself, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the speed increase in the same round. Manifesting the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. If manifested on another creature, the manifestation time is 1 action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Call Cohort.MOD					DESC:Call cohort teleports the manifester's cohort to him or her from any distance within a plane (but not between planes). A cohort is gained with the Leadership feat. The manifester determines the arrival point of the cohort at any point within close range. If the cohort is not separated from the character when he or she manifests this power, it instead allows the character to teleport the cohort from one point to another within close range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Call Weaponry.MOD					DESC:The manifester calls a weapon "from thin air" into his or her waiting hand (actually, it is a real weapon hailing from some other random location in the multiverse). The manifester doesn't have to see or know of a weapon to call it-in fact, he or she can't ever call a specific weapon. The character just specifies the type. If the specified weapon type is one the manifester can call at his or her level, it appears. If the character calls a projectile weapon, it comes complete with 3d6 bolts, arrows, or sling bullets, as appropriate (the ammunition does not have an enhancement bonus, even at 10th level and above). If the character relinquishes his or her grip on the weapon for 2 or more rounds, it automatically returns to wherever it originally came from. As the manifester's level increases, he or she can summon better and better weapons, although the power point cost is also greater. Weapons with enhancement bonuses are assumed to be psionic, unless the manifester specifies otherwise. Weapons gained by call weaponry are distinctive due to the low hum they emit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Catapsi.MOD						DESC:Catapsi makes it more difficult for other psionic characters to manifest their powers (the character is not affected by his or her own catapsi manifestation). All psionic activity within the area requires twice as many power points to manifest, unless opponents make a successful Will save each time they manifest a power. Freely manifesting 0-level powers takes 1 full round, instead of 1 action, in a catapsi field. If two or more fields of catapsi overlap, one field cancels out the other (determine randomly). Catfall.MOD	DESC:The manifester recovers instantly from a fall and can absorb some damage from falling. The character lands on his or her feet no matter how far he or she falls, and the first 3 points of falling damage are treated as subdual damage. A psionic character can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to save him or herself if the character unexpectedly falls. Manifesting the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Chameleon.MOD					DESC:The manifester receives a +10 enhancement bonus on Hide checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Charm Monster (Psionics).MOD			DESC:This power makes a creature regard the manifester as his or her trusted friend and ally. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the manifester or allies, however, he or she receives a +5 bonus on his or her saving throw. The power does not enable the manifester to control the charmed creature as if he or she was an automaton, but he or she perceives the manifester's words and actions in the most favorable way. The manifester can try to give the subject orders, but must win an opposed Charisma check to convince him or her to do anything he or she would not ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A charmed person never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by the manifester or apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the power. The manifester does not need to be able to speak the subject's language to communicate with him or her.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Charm Person (Psionics).MOD			DESC:This power makes a humanoid of Medium-size or smaller regard the manifester as his or her trusted friend and ally. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the manifester or allies, however, he or she receives a +5 bonus on his or her saving throw. The power does not enable the manifester to control the charmed person as if he or she was an automaton, but he or she perceives the manifester's words and actions in the most favorable way. The manifester can try to give the subject orders, but must win an opposed Charisma check to convince him or her to do anything he or she would not ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A charmed person never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by the manifester or apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the power. Note also that the manifester must speak the person's language to communicate commands, or else be good at pantomiming.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clairaudience/Clairvoyance (Psionics).MOD	DESC:Clairaudience/clairvoyance enables the manifester to concentrate upon some locale and hear or see (manifester's choice) almost as if he or she were there. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known-a place familiar to the manifester or an obvious one. The power does not allow psionically enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically or psionically dark, the manifester sees nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, the manifester can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the power's effect. Lead sheeting, magical protection or psionic protection blocks the power, and the manifester senses that the power is so blocked. The power creates an invisible sensor that can be dispelled or negated. The power functions only on the manifester's current plane of existence.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clairtangency.MOD					DESC:The manifester can emulate a far hand or far punch effect at any distance, simultaneously emulating clairaudience/clairvoyance. The manifester can concentrate upon some locale and see almost as if he or she were there. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known-a place familiar to the manifester or an obvious one. Once the manifester is gazing upon a particular location, he or she may use an effect similar to either far hand or far punch (the manifester doesn't need to manifest either power). Clairtangency's duration is up to 1 minute/level when used with a far hand effect, but it expires as soon as a far punch effect is used.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Claws of the Bear.MOD				DESC:The power grants the manifester a claw attack (which does not draw an attack of opportunity) with a base damage of 1d12. This power can be used in conjunction with feats, powers, or spells allowing additional attacks in 1 round, and it can be used with multiple attacks gained through level advancement.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Claws of the Vampire.MOD			DESC:The power grants the manifester a claw attack (which does not draw an attack of opportunity) with a base damage of 1d8. Simultaneously, the manifester heals as many points of damage as he or she deals with claws of the vampire. This power can be used in conjunction with feats, powers, or spells allowing additional attacks in one round, and it can be used with multiple attacks gained through level advancement.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Combat Precognition.MOD				DESC:The manifester gains a +1 insight bonus to AC. If he or she is caught flat-footed, this bonus to AC does not apply.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Combat Prescience.MOD				DESC:The manifester gains a +2 insight bonus on his or her attack roll.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Compression.MOD					DESC:The manifester shrink up to 10%% per manifester level, decreasing by this amount in height, width, and depth (to a maximum reduction of 50%%). Weight decreases by approximately the cube of the size decrease as follows: The character's equipment also shrinks. His or her hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but Strength decreases along with size. For every 10%% of reduction, the character's Strength score suffers an enlargement penalty of -1, to a minimum score of 1. Multiple psionic or magical effects that decrease size do not stack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Conceal Thoughts.MOD				DESC:The manifester protects his or her thoughts from analysis. While the duration lasts, the feat Psychic Inquisitor fails to operate against the character, and he or she gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks against those attempting to discern his or her true intentions with Sense Motive. The character also gains a +4 bonus on his or her saving throw against any power used to read his or her mind.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Concussion.MOD					DESC:The target is pummeled with for 3d6 points of damage. The manifester may choose to have the power deal an equal amount of subdual damage instead. Concussion always affects a subject within range that the manifester can see, even if the subject is in melee or has partial cover or concealment. Inanimate objects are also damaged by the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cone of Sound.MOD					DESC:The manifester releases a focused scream of sonic energy that deals 5d4 points of damage to each creature within its area. (Cone of sound doesn't work in an area of magical silence.) Unattended objects also take damage, and the sonic energy can break fragile items. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the sound may continue beyond the barrier if the power's range permits; otherwise, it stops there just as any other power effect does.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Confidante.MOD					DESC:The manifester forges a permanent telepathic bond with another creature, which must have an Intelligence score of 6 or higher. The bond can be established only with a willing subject, who therefore receives no saving throw and gains no benefit from power resistance. The manifester can communicate telepathically through the bond even if he or she does not share a common language with the subject. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another). XP Cost: 2,000 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Contingency (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester can place another power upon his or her person so that the latter power comes into effect under some condition the manifester dictates when manifesting contingency. The contingency power and the power it is to bring into effect are manifested at the same time. The 10-minute manifestation time is the minimum total for both manifestations; if the companion power has a manifestation time longer than 10 minutes, use that manifestation time instead. The power to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects the manifester's person and be of a power level no higher than one-third the character's manifester level (rounded down, maximum 6th level). The conditions needed to bring the power into effect must be clear, although they can be general. The contingency immediately brings into effect the second power, the latter being "manifested" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole power complex (contingency and the companion power) may fail when called on. The companion power occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether the character wants it to. Only one contingency power can be in use at a time; if a second is manifested, the first one (if still active) is negated.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Air.MOD					DESC:The manifester has some control over wind speed and direction. The speed of air within the area can be increased or decreased by up to 10 +5/level miles per hour. The manifester can alter the direction of any wind that moves at this speed or less by up to 90 degrees from its original direction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Body.MOD					DESC:The manifester controls the actions of any humanoid that is Medium-size or smaller. Control body doesn't require mental contact with the subject. The manifester can force the subject to perform, although the manifester has only rudimentary control over the subject's limbs. The manifester can make the subject stand up, sit down, walk, turn around, and so on, but operating the vocal cords is too difficult, and power manifestation is not possible. The manifester can force the subject to engage in combat, but its attack roll and AC are not its own. The controlled subject's attack bonus is equal to the manifester's base attack bonus + the subject's Strength modifier (or Dexterity modifier if a ranged attack) with a -4 circumstance penalty applied. The controlled subject cannot make attacks of opportunity against creatures the subject threatens. The controlled subject's AC gains no benefit from his or her Dexterity score, but he or she does gain a positive benefit, if any, equal to half the manifester's Dexterity modifier. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive one new saving throw with a morale bonus of +2. The manifester needs to see the subject to control it. While the subject's body is under control, the subject's mind is not. Creatures that can trigger abilities by an act of will alone can continue to do so.  Attempting to manifest powers in this fashion requires a Concentration check for each power manifested against a DC of 10 + the level of the power the subject attempts to manifest.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Flames.MOD				DESC:The manifester controls the intensity or movements of one fire source. A nonmagical fire source can be controlled if its bed or base is equal to or less than 1 square foot/level; larger fires cannot be controlled. The manifester can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the character of control, while maintaining concentration, but only one specified change can be made to one fire source in a round. When control over a fire source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been moved beyond its original bed). Increase/Decrease Flame: The manifester can increase a fire's size by up to 1 square foot/level. Each 1-square-foot expansion increases the potential damage the flames can deal by +1. The manifester can increase a fire's size beyond the original area, as long as it was equal to or smaller than the allowed size to begin with. The manifester can artificially keep a fire burning that would normally expire for lack of fuel, but dousing a controlled fire in sufficient water still puts it out. The manifester can decrease the intensity of a flame by 1 square foot/level. Each such decrease in flame intensity causes a -1 reduction to its damage potential (to a minimum of 1 point). Reducing a fire's size to zero extinguishes it ? permanently. Animate Fire: The manifester can make a fire move as if a living creature. An animated fire moves with a speed of 30 feet. It can have a crude humanoid or crude shape (or something more artistic, with an appropriate Craft [sculpting] check against a DC set by the DM), as long as the fire's overall volume does not exceed its original volume. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original bed dies as soon as control over it lapses. The animated fire can attack a target, using the controller's base attack bonus to deliver touch attacks. A successful attack has a chance to set the foe on fire (the foe must roll a Reflex save [DC 15] to avoid this). Normally the victim is allowed a Reflex save each round to put out the flames; otherwise the fire burns for another 1d6 points of damage. Additional hits by the animated fire mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the animated fire to intensify flames that are already burning (thus denying the foe Reflex saves after the first).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Light.MOD					DESC:The manifester can increase or decrease total illumination in an area by up to 20%% per manifester level. This increases or decreases overall effective range of vision for characters and creatures dependent on light by the same percentage. Decreasing the ambient light in an area by 100%% renders those with normal and low-light vision blind within the affected area.  The change in intensity can be gradual or sudden. Decreasing ambient light grants circumstance bonuses to Hide checks in the area by +1 for each 40%% graduation. The manifester can increase the ambient light in the area to such intensity that it blinds for 1 round every normally sighted creature in the area that fails a Fortitude save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Object.MOD				DESC:The manifester can move inanimate objects, almost as if they were alive. Live vegetation may not be controlled in this fashion, nor may already animate objects or undead. The controlled object moves like a puppet, with jerky and clumsy movements. If rigid, it makes creaking, groaning, or grating sounds as the character controls it. The object can move with a speed of 10 feet. A controlled object that attacks an opponent has one slam attack with an attack bonus of +0, dealing 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage. Note: The manifester may attempt to "control" a normal lock, making it move in such a way as to attempt to unlock itself. Using this power in this fashion grants a +4 competence bonus on Open Lock checks involving that particular lock.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Shadow.MOD				DESC:The manifester controls the shadow cast by anyone or anything. The controlled shadow is like a puppet that parodies imagined actions of the object or creature casting the shadow, even if the subject stands still. The manifester can even make the shadow move away from its source, so long as it is cast along a wall or flat surface and remains within range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Control Sound.MOD					DESC:The manifester shapes and alter existing sounds. The manifester can target one sound or a group of related sounds. A sound as quiet as a snapping finger can be controlled, but no quieter. The character can substitute any nonmagical sound he or she has heard for the target sound. The manifester can change the words of a speaker into inarticulate babble or into other words entirely. If The manifester attempts to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or an inherently terrifying sound, he or she must succeed at a Bluff check with a +5 circumstance bonus opposed by the defender's Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion. The manifester can muffle a sound all the way to nothing, or magnify a sound to such loudness that it can shatter nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramics, or porcelain (vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth). When a sound is destructively magnified in this manner, all applicable objects within a 3-foot radius of the originating sound are smashed into dozens of pieces. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per manifester level are not affected. Alternatively, the manifester can modulate a sound so that it affects only a single item of the appropriate material weighing up to 10 pounds per manifester level, if within 5 feet of the originating sound. Crystalline creatures of any weight take 1d6 points of damage per manifester level (maximum 10d6) if within 5 feet of the originating sound.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Create Food and Water (Psionics).MOD	DESC:This power fashions highly nourishing, if rather bland, food. The food decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours. The water created by this power is just like clean rain water. The water doesn't go bad as the food does.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Create Sound.MOD					DESC:The manifester creates a volume of sound that arises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. The character chooses what type of sound the power creates when first manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its basic character. The volume of sound created, however, depends on the character's level. A manifester can produce as much noise as four normal humans per manifester level (maximum twenty humans). The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.  If the sound created is a specific message, only a few words can be created, and they repeat over and over until the duration expires or is dismissed. If the manifester attempts to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or an inherently terrifying sound, he or she must succeed at a Bluff check with a +2 circumstance bonus opposed by the defender's Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion. Create sound can be used as a basis for control sound effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crisis of Breath.MOD				DESC:The manifester compels the subject to purge its entire store of air in one explosive exhalation, and thereby disrupt the subject's autonomic breathing cycle. The subject's lungs do not automatically breathe in again while the power's duration lasts. Those who choose to consciously control their breathing each round (in an attempt to regain some air) are limited only to partial actions during that round as they gasp for breath. Affected creatures can choose to take action normally, but each round they do so they risk blacking out from lack of oxygen. They must succeed at a Constitution check (DC 10) every round that passes without a breath to remain conscious. Every round that goes by without a breath, the DC increases by 1, but the DC drops back to 10 if a normal breath is taken. If a subject fails a Constitution check, it is staggered (0 hp). The following round it drops to -1 hit points and is dying, unless the duration lapses first. Failing a lapse in the power's duration, the subject dies on the third round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Danger Sense.MOD					DESC:The manifester gains a +4 insight bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +4 insight bonus to AC against attacks by traps.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Darkvision (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The subject gains the ability to see 60 feet even in total darkness. Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight. Darkvision does not grant one the ability to see in magical darkness.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Daze (Psionics).MOD				DESC:This power clouds the mind of a humanoid of Medium-size or smaller so that he or she takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against him or her), but he or she can't move, use psionic powers, cast spells, and so on.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Demoralize.MOD					DESC:The manifester's enemies areceive a -1 morale penalty on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks. Allies are unaffected.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Destiny Dissonance.MOD				DESC:At the manifester's touch the subject takes 1d8 points of subdual damage. This touch attack, charged with a psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Poison (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester determines whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. The manifester can determine the exact type of poison with a successful Wisdom check (DC 20). A character with the Alchemy skill may additionally try an Alchemy check at DC 20. Note: The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Psionics.MOD				DESC:The manifester detects psionic auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long he or she studies a particular area or subject: 1st Round: Presence or absence of psionic auras. 2nd Round: Number of different psionic auras and the strength of the strongest aura.  An overwhelming aura stuns the manifester for 1 round and the power ends. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, the manifester can make Psicraft checks to determine the discipline involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + half manifester level for a nonpower effect.) Psionic areas, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's psionic power and strength depend on a power's functioning power level or an item's manifester level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect psionics indicates the stronger of the two. Time Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength: Note: Each round, the manifester can turn to detect things in a new area. The manifester can tell the difference between magical and psionic auras. The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Remote Viewing.MOD			DESC:The manifester immediately becomes aware of any attempt to observe him or her by means of clairaudience/clairvoyance or remote viewing. The power's effect radiates from the manifester and moves as he or she moves. The power also reveals the use of other means of viewing, including magical scrying. The manifester knows the location of every psionic sensor within the power's area. If the viewing attempt originates within the area, the manifester also knows its location. If the attempt originates outside this range, the manifester and the remote viewer immediately make opposed Remote View checks. (A Remote View check is the same as an Intelligence check for a creature without the Remote View skill. If opposing magical scrying, the manifester's Remote View check is opposed by the opponent's Scry check.) If the manifester at least matches the remote viewer's result, the manifester gets a visual image of the remote viewer and a sense of the remote viewer's direction and distance from the manifester (accurate to within one-tenth the distance).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Thoughts (Psionics).MOD		DESC:The manifester detects surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long the manifester studies a particular area or subject: 1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher). 2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the mental strength of each. 3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's Will save prevents the manifester from reading its thoughts, and the manifester must manifest detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence have simple, instinctual thoughts that the manifester can pick up. Note: Each round, the manifester can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detonation.MOD					DESC:The target is pummeled with for 17d6 points of damage. The manifester may choose to have the power deal an equal amount of subdual damage instead. Detonation always affects a subject within range that the manifester can see, even if the subject is in melee or has partial cover or concealment.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dimensional Anchor (Psionics).MOD		DESC:A ray springs from the manifester's hand. The maniester must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck is covered with a ectoplasmic film that completely blocks bodily extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by the dimensional anchor include those granted by spells such as astral projection, blink, dimension door, dimension slide, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, phase door, plane shift, shadow walk, dream walk, teleport, and similar spell-like, magical, or psionic abilities. The dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the power is manifested, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Dimensional anchor does not prevent astral constructs from disappearing at the end of an astral construct power. Dimensional anchor protects a subject from the effects of baleful teleport.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dimension Door (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester instantly transfers him or herself from the character's current location to any other spot within range. The character always arrives at exactly the spot desired-whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. The character can bring along up to 500 pounds of nonliving matter or 250 pounds of living matter. After using this power, the manifester can't take any other actions until his or her next turn. If the character arrives in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, he or she becomes trapped in the Astral Plane. Each round that the character is trapped in the Astral Plane in this way, he or she may make a Will save (DC 25) to return to the Material Plane at a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, make a Will save each minute to appear in a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, the character is stuck on the Astral Plane until rescued.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dimension Slide.MOD				DESC:The character instantly transfers him or herself from the character's current location to any other spot within range that the character can see directly. The character arrives at exactly the spot desired, if he or she can see it. A character cannot dimension slide through solid objects; even a curtain blocks dimension slide. A character cannot bring along more than his or her medium load carrying capacity, nor can a character bring along any living matter that weighs more than 20 pounds. After using this power, the character can't take any other actions until his or her next turn. If the character somehow attempts to transfer him or herself to a location occupied by a solid body, the power simply fails to function.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Disable.MOD						DESC:The manifester broadcasts a compulsion that convinces one or more creatures that they are disabled (at 0 hit points). Roll 2d4 to determine how many total HD of creatures can be affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the power's point of origin are affected first. No creature with 5 or more HD is affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Creatures affected by the pow?er believe that they have somehow been reduced to 0 hit points, and must act accordingly.  Creatures that do attempt to take actions immediately pierce the compulsion, and may act normally. Creatures that attempt to heal themselves or who receive healing are likewise freed of the compulsion, and if they are not otherwise wounded, the healing is wasted. Creatures who are attacked and take damage are also instantly freed of the compulsion. When the duration ends, the creatures' hit points "return" to their previous level (as they perceive the true state of their health). Note: Extra hit points are irrelevant for determining how many HD a creature has.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Disintegrate (Psionics).MOD			DESC:A ray springs from the manifester's finger, causing the creature or object it strikes to glow and vanish, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. The manifester must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter is affected, so the power disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even magical and psionic matter or energy of a magical or psionic nature, but not areas that negate psionics or magic. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is only partially affected. It suffers 5d6 points of damage instead of disintegrating. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected (that is, the ray only affects one target per manifestation).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dismissal (Psionics).MOD			DESC:This power forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane. Add the creature's HD to its saving throw and subtract the manifester's level as well. If the power succeeds, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is a 20%% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dismiss Ectoplasm.MOD				DESC:The manifester dismisses creatures or objects composed of ectoplasm, or that were formerly composed of ectoplasm. The power affects everything in a 30-foot radius. Creatures that fail their saving throw dissipate into so much constituent ectoplasm, which evaporates in the course of 1 round. Unattended objects automatically fail their saving throws unless they are psionically enhanced in some fashion, in which case they save as psionic items. Characters in ectoplasmic form who fail their saving throws may be displaced. Roll d%%: On a 01-50 result they are physically shifted to a random location in the Astral Plane, and on 51-00 they are destroyed outright.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Displacement (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester appears to be about 2 feet away from his or her true location. The character benefits from a 50%% miss chance as if he or she had total concealment. However, unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the character normally. True seeing reveals the character's true location.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dissipating Touch.MOD				DESC:The manifester's mere touch can disperse the surface material of a foe or object, sending a tiny portion of it far away. A successful melee touch attack deals 1d8 points of damage. This touch attack, charged with a psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dissolution.MOD					DESC:A creature or object the manifester selects is disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. Dissolution affects up to a 50-foot cube of nonliving, nonmagical matter whose hardness is less than 15. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is only partially affected, taking 10d6 points of damage instead of disintegrating.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dissolving Touch.MOD				DESC:The manifester's touch (or bite) is corrosive. The manifester deals 7d6 points of acid damage to any creature or object he or she touches. If making an unarmed attack, or using any of the bite or claw powers, this damage is in addition to any other damage dealt. If the manifester successfully grapples or pin a foe, the manifester's grasp deals 10d6 points of acid damage. If the manifester can entirely enclose an object (or a very small creature) in the grip of both hands, the manifester deals 12d6 points of damage. This acid denatures 1 round after use, losing all efficacy and ability to deal damage. The manifester is immune to his or her own acid.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Distract.MOD					DESC:Subjects of distract make all Listen, Spot, Search, and Sense Motive checks at a -1 penalty.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divert Teleport (Psychokinesis).MOD		DESC:The manifester senses the use of various Psychoportation powers and similar spells within the area. The manifester senses the use of these powers whether or not he or she can directly see them. When sensing the use of a specified effect, the manifester knows exactly where the creature is using the power. Specified powers include dimension door, dimension slide, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, fly, spider climb, teleport, and possibly others. The manifester can divert the final destination of any teleportation made by others within the area. This is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and counts toward the limit of one quickened power per round. The manifester can divert the destination of both incoming and outgoing teleportations, both psionic and magical. The manifester must overcome the power resistance of creatures that possess it for a successful diversion, and the teleporting creature can make a Will save to foil the diversion as well. For purposes of this power, "divert" means the manifester chooses the actual destination of any teleportation he or she can affect. The destination choosen must be a location to which the manifester has previously teleported.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divert Teleport (Psychoportation).MOD	DESC:The manifester senses the use of various Psychoportation powers and similar spells within the area. The manifester senses the use of these powers whether or not he or she can directly see them. When sensing the use of a specified effect, the manifester knows exactly where the creature is using the power. Specified powers include dimension door, dimension slide, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, fly, spider climb, teleport, and possibly others. The manifester can divert the final destination of any teleportation made by others within the area. This is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and counts toward the limit of one quickened power per round. The manifester can divert the destination of both incoming and outgoing teleportations, both psionic and magical. The manifester must overcome the power resistance of creatures that possess it for a successful diversion, and the teleporting creature can make a Will save to foil the diversion as well. For purposes of this power, "divert" means the manifester chooses the actual destination of any teleportation he or she can affect. The destination choosen must be a location to which the manifester has previously teleported.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divination (Psionics).MOD			DESC:Divination can provide a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. The base chance for a correct divination is 70%% + 1%% per manifester level. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it. If the dice roll fails, the manifester knows the power failed, unless specific psionics or magic yielding false information is at work. Multiple divinations about the same action by the same manifester use the same dice roll result as the first divination and yield the same answer each time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Domination.MOD					DESC:The manifester can control the actions of any humanoid of Medium-size or smaller. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If the manifester and the subject share a common language, the manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subject's abilities. If no common language is shared, the manifester can only communicate basic commands. The manifester knows what the subject is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the manifester and subject are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subject to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dream Travel.MOD					DESC:The manifester and any creature touched are drawn into the region of dreams. The manifester can take more than one creature along (subject to the level limit), but all must be touching each other. The characters physically enter the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind. For every minute the character moves through dream, he or she can "wake" to find him or herself five miles displaced in the waking world. Thus, a character can use this power to travel rapidly by physically entering the dream world, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back into the waking world. The manifester knows where he or she will come out in the waking world. Dream travel can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures who dream, but this requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders. This is a potentially perilous proposition, at the DM's option. Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours on an uninterrupted journey. Any creatures touched by the manifester when dream travel is manifested also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. They may opt to follow the character, wander off into the dreams of others, or stumble back into the waking world (50%% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned). Creatures unwilling to accompany the character into the region of dreams receive a Will save, negating the effect if successful.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Duodimensional Hand.MOD				DESC:The manifester's hand becomes two-dimensional, making it razor-sharp. Instead of bludgeoning damage, the manifester's unarmed attacks do slashing or piercing damage (manifester's choice), but the damage potential does not increase. Additionally, the hand is now psionically keen, increasing its critical threat range to 17-20. If a combination of powers would allow the character to manifest duodimensional hand on a weapon, the threat range can increased to no more than 17-20, but the damage multiplier is that of the weapon. Note: The third spatial component of the hand still exists but is temporarily shunted into the Ethereal Plane, so against ethereal or incorporeal targets this power is ineffective.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ectoplasmic Armor.MOD				DESC:The subject is covered in ectoplasmic armor that provides a +10 armor bonus to AC. Other armor cannot be worn at the same time as ectoplasmic armor. If the subject takes off the ectoplasmic armor, it immediately dissipates. Treat ectoplasmic armor as leather armor for purposes of armor check penalty or speed reduction. Because the armor is composed of astral ectoplasm (emulating force for the purposes of this power), incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ectoplasmic Cocoon.MOD				DESC:Strands of ectoplasm wrap up the subject like a mummy. The subject can still breathe but is otherwise helpless, being unable to see or take any physical actions. The subject cannot speak because the ectoplasmic strands muffle sounds, but the subject's nostrils are clear. The subject can execute purely mental actions (such as manifesting powers). The writhing, regenerating nature of the cocoon prevents its occupant from making a physical bid for escape. However, cutting or damaging a large enough strand can free the cocooned victim. The strands have hardness 17 and 30 hit points. Creatures that are cocooned high in the air fall, and cocooned swimmers may drown.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ectoplasmic Form.MOD				DESC:The manifester and all his or her gear become a mass of ectoplasm that generally conforms to the character's normal shape. The character gains damage reduction 20/+1. The character's material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, although size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The character becomes immune to poison and critical hits. A character cannot attack or manifest powers while in ectoplasmic form. The character loses supernatural abilities, if any, while in ectoplasmic form. The character cannot run, but can swim with a +15 circumstance bonus to the Swim skill. The character can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, along with all the character is wearing or holding in his or her hands while the duration persists.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ectoplasmic Shambler.MOD			DESC:The manifester fashions a many-legged mass of ectoplasm called an ectoplasmic shambler. The shambler moves as the character directs it at a speed of 10 feet. It can completely surround objects (and opponents) over which it is manifested or onto which it moves, because it has the consistency of thick mist. The vision of those within the shambler is limited to 10 feet, and manifesting powers (or casting spells) within the shambler's "belly" is impossible. Creatures enveloped by the shambler, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage at the end of each round they remain within the shambler. A strong wind that blows against the shambler reduces its speed to 0 during the first round, and in subsequent rounds moves it in the direction of the wind at a speed of 5 feet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ecto Puppet.MOD					DESC:This power manifests an astral construct that is visibly tethered to the manifester, and the manifester directly controls its actions. It appears within 5 feet of the character and can move up to the noted range. The "tether" consists of light connecting the character's hands with its forelimbs. Except for being visibly tethered, the astral construct is as normal. The power creates an astral construct of the highest level possible, corresponding to the highest-level astral construct power the manifester knows. As a consequence of the direct control, the construct gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, and a +2 enhancement bonus on Will saves. The cost to manifest ecto puppet is equal to the cost of the astral construct power being emulated +2.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Elfsight.MOD					DESC:The manifester gains low-light vision for the duration of the power. If elfsight is used in conjunction with my light, the character can see twice as far as indicated in the latter power's description.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Empathic Transfer.MOD				DESC:When a character manifests this power, he or she can transfer up to 8 points of damage per manifester level from the subject creature to him or herself. Alternatively, the manifester can absorb one poison or one disease afflicting the subject creature into him or herself. When the character absorbs a poison or disease, he or she does not absorb the damage done previously dealt by the affliction, but does take up the burden of making the secondary and/or continuing Fortitude saves against the affliction. Finally, the character can choose to transfer up to 1 point of temporary ability damage per manifester level from the subject to him or herself.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Empathy.MOD						DESC:The manifester detects the surface emotions of any creature he or she can see that is in range. The character can sense basic needs, drives, and emotions.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Emulate Power.MOD					DESC:When manifesting emulate power, the manifester chooses any other power, regardless of discipline or whether he or she knows the power, of 6th level or less, and duplicate its effect as if the character had manifested that power. XP Cost: 300 XP or the XP requirement of the emulated power, whichever is greater.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Barrier.MOD				DESC:The manifester's body assimilates and converts energy attacks to harmless light. The character gains resistance 10 to a specific energy attack. Once the power has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per manifester level (maximum 150 points) from specified energy attacks, it is discharged. Specified energy attacks include powers and spells that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. When the character absorbs damage, he or she radiates visible light for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage successfully ignored. The light is strong enough to illuminate a 60-foot-radius area.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Conversion.MOD				DESC:The manifester's body assimilates and converts energy attacks to a ray. The character gains resistance 10 to a specific energy attack. Once the power has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per manifester level (maximum 150 points) from specified energy attacks, it is discharged. Specified energy attacks include powers and spells that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. The character can discharge stored energy in a ray as a single ranged touch attack. This is a standard action. The ray is composed of the energy type absorbed. The character can choose to fire the ray prior to complete saturation of the energy barrier, though this ends the power. If the ray successfully strikes the target, the target takes a number of hit points equal to the total number of hit points successfully ignored by the energy barrier.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ethereal Jaunt (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester becomes ethereal, along with his or her equipment. The character in a place called the Ethereal Plane that overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane. When the power expires, the character returns to material existence. Note: An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down (albeit at half normal speed). As an incorporeal creature, the character can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects and magical abjurations affect the character normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and powers manifest while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. By contrast, treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they had become material. If the character ends the power and becomes material while inside a material object, he or she is shunted off to the nearest open space and suffers 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Etherealness (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester and other creatures joined by linked hands (along with their equipment) become ethereal. Besides him or herself, the manifester can bring one creature per three manifester levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once ethereal, the creatures need not stay together. When the power expires, all affected creatures in the Ethereal Plane return to material existence. Note: An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down (albeit at half normal speed). As an incorporeal creature, the character can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects and magical abjurations affect the character normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and powers manifest while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. By contrast, treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they had become material. If the power ends and creatures become material while inside a material object, they are shunted off to the nearest open space and suffer 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Expanded Vision.MOD				DESC:The manifester is granted a 315-degree arc of sight, allowing him or her some slight vision of creatures that might otherwise fully flank the character.  Opponents flanking the character gain only a +1 bonus on their attack rolls instead of +2 (although rogues can still take sneak attacks). All the character's Spot checks gain a +1 enhancement bonus. Concurrently, the character suffers a -2 enhancement penalty against all gaze attacks while the power persists.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Expansion.MOD					DESC:The manifester grows up to 10%% per manifester level, increasing by this amount in height, width, and depth (to a maximum growth of 100%%). Weight increases by approximately the cube of the size increase as follows: Equipment worn or carried is also enlarged. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the character bursts weak enclosures. However, the character's larger size is constrained without harm by stronger materials. The character cannot crush him or herself. The character's hit points, Armor Class, and base attack bonus do not change, but Strength increases along with size. For every 20%% of enlargement, the character gains a +1 enlargement bonus to Strength. Multiple psionic or magical effects that increase size do not stack. Psionic and magical properties are not enhanced with this power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fabricate (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester converts material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures and psionic or magic items cannot be created or altered by fabricate. The quality of items made by this power is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If the character works with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per manifester level instead of 1 cubic yard. The character must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, and so on). Manifesting requires 1 full round per cubic yard (or cubic foot) of material to be affected by the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
False Sensory Input.MOD				DESC:The manifester has a limited ability to falsify one of the subject's senses. The subject thinks he or she sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels something other than what his or her senses actually report. The manifester can't fabricate a sensation where none exists, nor make the subject completely oblivious to a sensation, but the manifester can falsify the specifics of one sensation for different specifics. The manifester can switch between senses he or she falsifies round by round. The manifester can't alter a sensation's "intensity" by more than 50%%. If this power is used to distract an enemy psion who is attempting to manifest a power, the enemy must make a Concentration check as if against a nondamaging power (the DC equals the distracting power's save DC + 3 in this case).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Far Hand.MOD					DESC:The manifester can lift and move an object at will from a distance. As a move-equivalent action, the character can move the object up to 15 feet in any direction, though the power ends if the distance between the character and the object ever exceeds the power's range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Far Punch.MOD					DESC:The target is buffeted with telekinetic force for 1 point of damage. Far punch always affects a target within range that the manifester can see, even if the target is in melee or has partial cover or concealment. However, a shield spell protects the target. Inanimate objects cannot be damaged by the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fatal Attraction.MOD				DESC:The manifester plants a hidden death-urge impulse in the subject's unconscious. The impulse slowly takes root and reinforces itself in the subject's mind over a period of 1d4 days. The subject's conscious mind remains completely unaware of the death urge secretly swelling within. The subject's companions, if any, may each make one Wisdom check on the final day of the time period to notice that the subject seems unaccountably dour and fatalistic. When the urge has grown to an overpowering psychosis (after 1d4 days), the subject looks for the quickest, most likely method to end his or her life and attempts to do so. If nothing better offered itself, the subject would attempt to perform a coup de grace on him or herself. If the subject had no weapon, he or she would attempt to batter him or herself to death on a wall or other surface. If the subject goes through with a method but fails to die, he or she can make another Fortitude save against the original DC to break the compulsion. Otherwise, the urge secretly grows again over 1d4 days, and the cycle repeats.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fate Link.MOD					DESC:The manifester temporarily links the fates of any two creatures, if both fail their saving throws. If either linked creature experiences pain, both feel it. When one loses hit points, the other loses the same amount. If either dies, the other must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save or gain a number of negative levels equal to the character level of the creature that died (minimum one). All other effects are not transferred by the fate link. A manifester could attempt to create a chain of fate linked creatures, if desired.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fate of One.MOD					DESC:The manifester gains limited omniscience, allowing the character to reroll a saving throw, attack roll, or skill check, and use the better of the two rolls for the result. A character can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in a clutch situation. Manifesting the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Feather Fall (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The creatures or objects affected fall slowly. The rate of fall is instantly changed to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), with no damage incurred upon landing while the power is in effect. However, when the duration expires, a normal rate of fall occurs. A character can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to save him or herself if he or she unexpectedly falls. Manifesting the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. This power has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If manifested on a falling item, the item does half normal damage based on weight (1d6 per 400 pounds) with no bonus for the height of the drop. The power works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Feel Light.MOD					DESC:The manifester experiences light translated through tactile sensation (by touch). The character's entire body becomes a receiver for light. The character's field of vision does not change, but if he or she has darkvision, sight is not translated to touch via feel light. If the character's eyes are working normally, the expanded view gives a +1 enhancement bonus on all Spot and Search checks. If this power is used in conjunction with hear light, the bonus is +2.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Feel Sound.MOD					DESC:The manifester experiences sound translated through tactile sensation (by touch). The character's range of hearing does not change.  If the character's ears are working normally, the expanded reception gives a +1 enhancement bonus on all Listen checks. If this power is used in conjunction with see sound, the bonus is +2.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Finger of Fire.MOD				DESC:A ray of  burning ectoplasm projects from the manifester's finger. The character must succeed at a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of fire damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Firefall.MOD					DESC:Motes of unstable ectoplasm flare and dissipate explosively within the area designated. Any creature in the area takes 1d4 points of fire damage. Flammable materials such as cloth, paper, parchment, thin wood, and so on, burn if the flames touch them. A character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fission.MOD						DESC:The manifester can divide him or herself, creating a duplicate up to 5 feet away. The duplicate thinks and acts exactly as the character does and follows the character's orders, although it will not do anything the character wouldn't do him or herself. The duplicate has all the character's abilities but none of the equipment. The duplicate has all the character's hit points, half his or her power points (figured after deducting the cost of this power), and other physical traits the character had at the time he or she manifested the power. Powers, spells, or other effects affecting the character do not affect the duplicate. When the duration expires or when the character dismisses the power, the character and his or her duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other they are. The character takes half of the damage the duplicate has suffered at the time of rejoining. This can't bring the character to -10 hit points or less. Also, the character loses half of the power points the duplicate used up. If either the character or the duplicate dies before the duration expires, there is no rejoining; however, the survivor (either the original or the duplicate) gains one negative level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flaming Shroud.MOD				DESC:The manifester wraps the subject in a shroud of burning ectoplasm. If the target fails its Reflex save, it suffers 11d6 points of fire damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Float.MOD						DESC:The manifester can mentally support one creature or object in water or similar liquid at will from a distance. The character cannot move the floating object, but if the subject of the power is animate, it can move through the water without fear of submerging (or drowning, if an unskilled swimmer). The power ends if the distance between the character and the subject ever exceeds the power's range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fly (Psionics).MOD				DESC:The power's subject can fly at a speed of 90 feet (60 feet if the creature wears medium or heavy armor). The subject can fly up at half speed and descend at double speed. The flying subject's maneuverability is good. Using the fly power requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or manifest powers normally. The subject of fly can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. Should the duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the psionic effect fails slowly. The subject drops 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in this time, it is safe. If not, it falls the rest of the distance (falling damage is 1d6 per 10 feet of fall). Since negating a power effectively ends it, the subject falls immediately if fly is negated.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Forced Mindlink.MOD				DESC:The manifester forges a telepathic bond with another creature, which must have an Intelligence score of 6 or higher. The manifester can communicate telepathically through the bond even if he or she does not share a common language with the subject. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).  While the bond can be forced on an unwilling creature, it does not compel the creature to respond through the bond.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Foresight (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester gains a powerful sixth sense in relation to him or herself or another. Once the power is manifested, the character receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the power. If the manifester is the subject, he or she is never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the power gives a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever the manifester would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC. When another creature is the object of the power, the manifester receives warnings about that creature. The manifester must communicate what he or she learns to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and it can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate power) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the power's subject, provided the manifester acts on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC or Reflex saves.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Freedom of Movement (Psionics).MOD		DESC:This power enables the manifester or the creature touched to move and attack normally for the duration of the power, even under the influence of psionics that usually impedes movement. The power also allows a character to move and attack normally while underwater, even with cutting weapons and smashing weapons, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The power does not, however, allow water breathing without further appropriate psionic adaptation.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Genesis.MOD						DESC:The manifester creates a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes. This power should be manifested only while the manifester is on the Ethereal or Astral Plane. At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 10 feet per manifester level. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn't really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases dramatically to only 1/2 inch in radius per week (just over 2 feet per year). The environment within the demiplane is determined by the manifester when genesis is first manifested, reflecting most any desire the psion can visualize, as long as the DM approves (although no environmental effect within the plane can duplicate effects greater than those of 3rd-level powers). Factors such as solid ground, air, water, and temperature must be determined by the manifester. This power cannot create life, nor can it create construction; such particulars must be introduced to the demiplane in some other fashion. All demiplanes created with genesis are in contact with the Astral and Ethereal Planes. Antigenesis: It is possible to manifest genesis on normal planes and demiplanes, but only the most perverse or evil shaper would consider doing so. If genesis is manifested within a normal plane or demiplane, the power takes effect according to the speed noted above; however, the energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a growing dead spot like on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot utterly wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level plain of inert dust. Living things that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly harmed. But plants can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, marine creatures die even more quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone. An antigenesis wave dies out after 100d10 years, or can be canceled by yet another manifestation of genesis.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Glide.MOD						DESC:The power's subject can glide through the air with a speed of 20 feet (10 feet if the creature wears medium or heavy armor). The subject can only fly upward at a speed of 5 feet but may descend at a speed of 50 feet. The gliding subject's maneuverability is poor. Using the glide power requires as much concentration as running, so the subject cannot attack or manifest powers normally. The subject of glide cannot carry aloft more weight than its medium load carrying capacity, plus any armor it wears. Should the duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the psionic effect fails slowly. The subject drops 50 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that time, it is safe. If not, it falls the rest of the distance (falling damage is 1d6 per 10 feet of fall). Since negating a power effectively ends it, the subject falls immediately if glide is negated.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Graft Weapon.MOD					DESC:The manifester permanently attaches any weapon-mundane, psionic, or magical-onto the end of one of his or her arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of the arm, and that hand is nowhere to be seen. If the character is proficient with the weapon, he or she adds +1 to all attack and damage rolls while using the weapon (this stacks with all other bonuses, including those granted by Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization). The grafted weapon becomes subject to powers that normally do not effect equipment, such as expansion. More importantly, since the weapon is a natural part of the character's body, powers that normally only enhance unarmed attacks and touch attacks now apply to the grafted weapon. However, the character loses the use of one hand and receives a -2 competence penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorphose the character (or just his or her hands) can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, at the manifester's discretion. If the weapon takes damage, the character takes the damage as well. If the character is healed, so is the grafted weapon. If the weapon is destroyed, the character loses 2 points of Constitution; the ability damage persists until the character can graft another weapon or restore his or her natural anatomy (see below). A character can change out weapons by using this power again. If the character manifests this power without any weapon, his or her natural anatomy returns (but the character can't use this power to recover a limb lost through some other mishap).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Grease (Psionics).MOD				DESC:A grease power covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the power is manifested must make a successful Reflex save or slip, skid, and fall. Those who successfully save can move at half speed across the surface. However, those who remain in the area must each make a new saving throw each round to avoid falling and to be able to move. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. The power can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this power, while objects wielded or employed by creatures receive a Reflex save to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Biocurrent.MOD				DESC:The manifester's body produces an arc of electricity that targets a primary foe for 6d6 points of electricity damage per round that the character meets the requirements (see below). Electricity also arcs off the primary foe to strike additional foes initially within 15 feet of the primary foe, or who subsequently move within 15 feet of the primary foe while the duration lasts. Secondary foes also take 6d6 points of damage per round the duration lasts. Should either the primary or secondary foe fall to below 0 hit points, greater biocurrent's electrical arc random?ly retargets another primary and secondary foe while the duration continues. Targeted foes may move or make a saving throw each round for half damage (on that round only), but as long as they remain in range, they continue to be affected. Maintaining greater biocurrent is a full-round action (the manifester is limited to only 5-foot steps and no other actions). If the manifester takes damage while maintaining greater biocurrent, he or she must make a successful Concentration check. If any of these requirements are not met, the electrical arc winks out.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Concussion.MOD				DESC:The target is pummeled with for 5d6 points of ? damage. The manifester may choose to have the power deal an equal amount of subdual damage instead. Greater concussion always affects a subject within range that the manifester can see, even if the subject is in melee or has partial cover or concealment. Inanimate objects are also damaged by the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Domination.MOD				DESC:The manifester can control the actions of any humanoid of Medium-size or smaller. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If the manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subject's abilities, regardless of whether the manifester shares a language with the subject. The manifester knows what the subject is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the manifester and subject are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subject to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Emulation.MOD				DESC:When manifesting greater emulation, the manifester chooses any other power, regardless of discipline or whether he or she knows the power, of 8th level or less, and duplicate its effect as if the character had manifested that power. XP Cost: 5000 XP or the XP requirement of the emulated power, whichever is greater.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hammer.MOD						DESC:This power charges the manifester's touch with the force of a sledgehammer. A successful melee touch attack deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage. This touch attack, charged with a psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hear Light.MOD					DESC:The manifester experiences light translated through auditory sensation (by hearing).  The character can see what his or her eyes would normally reveal, but if the character has darkvision, sight is not translated to sound via hear light. If the character's eyes are working normally, the expanded view gives you a +1 enhancement bonus on all Spot and Search checks. If this power is used in conjunction with feel light, the bonus is +2.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hustle.MOD						DESC:The manifester can take an extra partial action, but must wait until his or her next round's worth of actions to do so. In effect, the character gives up a standard action on the round he or she manifests this power, but gains an extra partial action on the following round. This benefit counts as an enhancement bonus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hypercognition (Clairsentience).MOD		DESC:The manifester makes lightning-fast deductions based on only the slightest clue, pattern, or scrap of memory resident in his or her mind. The character can make reasonable statements about a person, place, or object, seemingly from very little knowledge. The nature of the knowledge gained concerning the subject of the analysis is subject to the DM's discretion but might include the answer to a riddle, the way out of a maze, stray bits of information about a person, legends about a place or object, or even a conclusion concerning a dilemma that the character' conscious mind is unable to produce. The DM may ask for an Intelligence check to receive the desired information (DM secretly determines the DC). Intelligence checks made with the aid of hypercognition have a +30 bonus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hypercognition (Psychometabolism).MOD	DESC:The manifester makes lightning-fast deductions based on only the slightest clue, pattern, or scrap of memory resident in his or her mind. The character can make reasonable statements about a person, place, or object, seemingly from very little knowledge. The nature of the knowledge gained concerning the subject of the analysis is subject to the DM's discretion but might include the answer to a riddle, the way out of a maze, stray bits of information about a person, legends about a place or object, or even a conclusion concerning a dilemma that the character' conscious mind is unable to produce. The DM may ask for an Intelligence check to receive the desired information (DM secretly determines the DC). Intelligence checks made with the aid of hypercognition have a +30 bonus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
#
Identify (Psionics).MOD				DESC:This power determines the single most basic function of a psionic item, including how to activate that function (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if any). If a psionic item has multiple different functions that are equally basic, identify determines the lowest-level function. If these functions are also of equal level, the DM decides randomly which is identified.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Immovability.MOD					DESC:The manifester is almost impossible to move. The character's weight does not vary; instead, he or she mentally attaches him or herself to the underlying fabric of the plane. Thus, the character could conceivably anchor him or herself in midair. The character opposes any attempt to be moved by a Strength check modified by a bonus equal to three times the character's manifester level. Once immovable, the character can't move to a new location unless he or she first dismisses the power or its duration expires. While the character is immovable, he or she loses all Dexterity bonuses to AC. Neither can the character attack or make any other movement. However, the character's anchored body gains damage reduction 20/+3.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Anchored Navigation.MOD		DESC:While the duration lasts, the manifester is aware of his or her exact distance and route (physical or psychoportive) back to a fixed starting point. The manifester must designate the "anchored" starting point when first manifesting the power. To designate other anchored starting points, the manifester must manifest additional anchored navigation powers. This power is useful for all Psychoportation powers (and in the minimum time for the method of travel utilized). Moreover, this power allows normal telepathic communication with any receptive beings within a 60-foot radius of the fixed point, regardless of distance. Use of anchored navigation extends across all planar boundaries.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Biofeedback.MOD			DESC:The manifester takes a portion of any attack that deals damage as points of subdual damage equal to twice his or her Strength modifier. This power is not retroactive to wounds received prior to manifesting biofeedback.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Clairtangency.MOD			DESC:The manifester can emulate telekinesis at any distance, simultaneously emulating clairaudience/clairvoyance. The manifester can concentrate upon some locale and see almost as if he or she were there. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known-a place familiar to the manifester or an obvious one. Once the manifester is gazing upon a particular location, he or she may use an effect similar to telekinesis (the manifester doesn't need to manifest the power). Improved clairtangency's duration is up to 1 minute/level when the telekinesis effect is used as a sustained force, but it expires immediately after a violent thrust.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Etherealness.MOD			DESC:The manifester and other creatures joined by linked hands (along with their equipment) become ethereal. Besides him or herself, the manifester can bring one creature per three manifester levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once ethereal, the creatures need not stay together. When the power expires, all affected creatures in the Ethereal Plane return to material existence. Note: An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down (albeit at half normal speed). As an incorporeal creature, the character can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects and magical abjurations affect the character normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and powers manifest while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. By contrast, treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they had become material. If the power ends and creatures become material while inside a material object, they are shunted off to the nearest open space and suffer 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Fabricate.MOD				DESC:The manifester converts material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures and psionic or magic items cannot be created or altered by fabricate. The quality of items made by this power is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If the character works with a mineral, the target is reduced to 10 cubic feet per manifester level instead of 10 cubic yards. The character must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, and so on). Manifesting requires 1 full round per cubic yard (or cubic foot) of material to be affected by the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Fly.MOD					DESC:The power's subject can fly at a speed of 180 feet (150 feet if the creature wears medium or heavy armor). The subject can fly up at half speed and descend at double speed. The flying subject's maneuverability is good. Using the fly power requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or manifest powers normally. The subject of fly can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. Should the duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the psionic effect fails slowly. The subject drops 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in this time, it is safe. If not, it falls the rest of the distance (falling damage is 1d6 per 10 feet of fall). Since negating a power effectively ends it, the subject falls immediately if fly is negated.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Telekinesis.MOD			DESC:The manifester moves objects or creatures by concentrating on them. The power can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust (manifester's choice). Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to 100 pounds per manifester level up to 50 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with power resistance. This version of the power lasts up to 1 round per manifester level, but it ends if the manifester ceases concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond the range of the power. The power ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If the manifester ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. The manifester might even be able to untie simple knots, though fine actions such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the telekinetic power can be expended in a single round. The manifester can hurl one or more objects or creatures that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet/level of all the objects. A manifester can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per manifester level. The manifester must succeed at attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using his or her base attack plus Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds for hard, dense objects. Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the power can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the power. If creatures are telekinetically hurled against solid surfaces, they take damage as if they had fallen 60 feet (6d6 points).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improved Vigor.MOD				DESC:The manifester gains 3 temporary hit points per manifester level (maximum 60 hit points).  These hit points do not stack with temporary hit points from other sources or with additional uses of vigor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Incarnate.MOD					DESC:The manifester invests other powers with self-sustaining energy so that they become permanent. The manifester must be at least the minimum level required to manifest the power. This power has no effect on powers that already create a permanent effect. A character can't incarnate a power with no duration or a duration of instantaneous. A character can't incarnate a power that has an XP cost of its own, nor can a character incarnate a power of level 6 or higher. The manifester must expend XP when manifesting this power. A character can never expend so much XP that doing so would drop the character one or more levels (though a character could forgo gaining a level in order to incarnate a particularly costly power). The XP costs vary depending on the target. Incarnate can be negated by a higher-level psion who also manifests incarnate or by use of psychic chirurgery. The DM may not allow some powers to become permanent through incarnate. The manifester knows before attempting to incarnate a power if it can or cannot be made permanent. XP Cost: To make a power permanent in regard to the manifester's self, he or she must expend a number of XP equal to the power's level x 300. To make a power permanent in regard to another creature, the manifester must expend a number of XP equal to the power's level x 600. To make a power permanent on an object or location, the manifester must expend a number of XP equal to the power's level x 900.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Inertial Barrier.MOD				DESC:The subject gains damage reduction 10/+5. Once the power has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per manifester level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged. Inertial barrier also absorbs up to half the damage from a fall. Damage absorbed from a fall counts toward discharging the effect. The psychokinetic barrier delays the effects of gases in the atmosphere for 2d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Inflict Pain.MOD					DESC:This telepathic strike deals 3d6 points of damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Inkling.MOD						DESC:An inkling can tell whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for the manifester in the immediate future. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 50%%, plus 1%% per manifester level; the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that the question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the inkling succeeds, the manifester gets one of four results: "Weal" (if the action will probably bring good results). "Woe" (for bad results). "Weal and woe" (for both). "Nothing" (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results). If the power fails, the manifester gets the "nothing" result. A psion who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it resulted from a failed or successful inkling. The inkling can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the inkling. Thus, it might miss the long-term consequences of the contemplated action. All inklings manifested by the same person about the same action use the same die roll result as the first inkling. Note: A character may only manifest inkling a number of times per day equal to his or her Wisdom modifier +1, regardless of further payment of power points or number of free manifestations left in the day.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Insanity (Psionics).MOD				DESC:Creatures affected by this power are permanently insane and constantly behave randomly, as indicated on the follow table: Except on a result of 1, roll again each round to see what the subject does that round. Wandering creatures leave the scene as if uninterested. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking them. Actions are checked at the beginning of each creature's turn. Any insane creature that is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn. Only psychic chirurgery and other extreme measures can restore the subject's sanity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Intrusive Sense Link.MOD			DESC:The subject creatuse senses what the manifester senses.  Only one sense is linked, and the manifester may not switch between senses with the same manifestation.  Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the subject creature moves out of the original manifestation range (but the link does not work across planes). The manifester does not control the creature, nor can the manifester communicate with it via this power. The manifester must concentrate to access the sense link. If he or she does not concentrate, that sense returns to the manifester's own immediate surroundings. The powers of the manifester's senses could be enhanced by other powers or items, if desired, allowing the subject creature the same enhanced sense. A successful negate psionics manifested on the manifester or the linked creature ends the power. With respect to the subject creature's own blindness, deafness, and so on, the manifester is an independent sensory organ. When linked to the manifester, the subject may make his or her own perception checks, such as Spot and Listen, regardless of the manifester's Spot and Listen results, if any. This power can be used to damage the subject.  For example, if the manifester links taste and then eats something particularly foul (DM's discretion), the subject creature must make another Will save against the original DC or be stunned for 1 round. If the manifester eats something that causes damage, the subject creature takes no damage but must make a saving throw against the original DC or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. Likewise, if the manifester links sight and is subject to a gaze attack, so is the subject.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The creature or object touched vanishes from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. If a character manifests the power on someone else, neither the character nor allies can see the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or employ psionics to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so. Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from her becomes visible. The subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable. The power ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this power, an "attack" includes any power targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not negate the power. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Note that powers that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. An invisible attacker gains a +2 bonus on his or her attack roll (for the single attack, either melee or ranged, that he or she is allowed before becoming visible), and the defender against such an attack loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility Purge (Psionics).MOD		DESC:The manifester is surrounded with a sphere with a radius of 5 feet per manifester level that negates all forms of invisibility. Anything invisible becomes visible while in the area.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Iron Body (Psionics).MOD			DESC:This power transforms the manifester's body into living iron. The manifester gains damage reduction 50/+3. He or she is immune to blindness, critical hits, damage to ability scores (except if that damage comes as a result of psionic combat), deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all powers, spells, or attacks that affect his or her physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect. The manifester only suffers half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, he or she also becomes vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems. The manifester gains a +6 enhancement bonus to his or her Strength score, but suffers a -6 enhancement penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and his or her speed is reduced to half normal. The manifester cannot drink (and thus can't use potions), nor play wind instruments. The manifester's unarmed attacks deal 1d6 points of normal damage, and the character is considered "armed" when making unarmed attacks (a Small manifester instead deals 1d4 points of damage). The character's weight increases by a factor of 10, causing him or her to sink in water. However, the charater could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean, while the power lasts.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Knock (Psionics).MOD				DESC:The knock power opens stuck, barred, locked, or psionically locked doors (and magically held and arcane locked doors). It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a psionically locked door, the power does not remove the psionic lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or becomes stuck again on its own. Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments, nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Note that the effect is limited by the area. Each power can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know Direction (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester instantly knows which way is north. If in a place where magnetic field lines do not specify north, the manifester may know the direction of a preeminent landmark, at the DM's discretion. The character only knows the direction of north immediately after manifesting this power. Subsequent movement could confuse matters once again.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know Location.MOD					DESC:The manifester generally knows where he or she is. The power reveals general information about the character's location. The information is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you according to a prominent local landmark.  Subsequent movement could confuse matters once again.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Body Adjustment.MOD			DESC:The manifester cures him or herself of 1d8 points of damage. Alternatively, the manifester can gain a +1 bonus on his or her next Fortitude save against poison or disease. Finally, a character can use body adjustment to heal 1 points of temporary ability damage. The manifester doesn't gain all three benefits from a single manifestation of this power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Concussion.MOD				DESC:The target is pummeled with for 1d6 points of ? damage. The manifester may choose to have the power deal an equal amount of subdual damage instead. Lesser Concussion always affects a subject within range that the manifester can see, even if the subject is in melee or has partial cover or concealment. Inanimate objects cannot be damaged by the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Domination.MOD				DESC:The manifester can control the actions of any humanoid of Medium-size or smaller with who the manifester shares a common language. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subject's mind.  The manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subject's abilities. The manifester knows what the subject is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the manifester and subject are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subject to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Metaphysical Weapon.MOD		DESC:A weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The enhanced weapon glows with pale radiance (not sufficient to provide illumination). An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attacks. Alternatively, the power can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must all be of the same type, and they have to be together in one group. Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their enhancement when used.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Mindlink (Psionics).MOD		DESC:The manifester forges a telepathic bond with another creature, which must have an Intelligence score of 6 or higher. The bond can be established only with a willing subject, who therefore receives no saving throw and gains no benefit from power resistance. The manifester can communicate telepathically through the bond even if he or she does not share a common language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Natural Armor.MOD			DESC:The manifester's skin grows thick ridges, providing a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, natural armor entails no armor check penalty or speed reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Levitate (Psionics).MOD				DESC:Levitate allows the manifester to move him or herself, another creature, or an object up and down as the manifester wishes. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The manifester can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down up to 20 feet each round; doing so is a move-equivalent action. The manifester cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient push or pull themselves along surfaces (generally at half its base speed). A levitating creature who attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds him or herself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, and so on, up to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Major Creation (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester creates a nonmagical, nonpsionic, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable or mineral matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per manifester level. The manifester must succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item. Attempting to use any created object as a material component in a spell causes the spell to fail. The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mass Cocoon.MOD					DESC:This power cocoons several creatures (or a single large creature that fits in a 10-foot cube) in a mass of writhing, tightening ectoplasm.  The power fails if the subject cannot fit inside the area.  The subject can still breathe but is otherwise helpless, being unable to see or take any physical actions. The subject cannot speak because the ectoplasmic strands muffle sounds, but the subject's nostrils are clear. The subject can execute purely mental actions (such as manifesting powers). The writhing, regenerating nature of the cocoon prevents its occupant from making a physical bid for escape. Teleport and other forms of travel provide a means of escape, but the cocoon extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. The mass cocoon resists negate psionics, but it can be disintegrated or destroyed through brute force (it has hardness 25 and 100 hit points). |PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mass Concussion.MOD				DESC:All creatures and objects within the area are pummled for 7d4 points of damage. The manifester may choose to have the power deal an equal amount of subdual damage instead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mass Domination.MOD				DESC:The manifester can control the actions of any humanoids of Medium-size or smaller, regardless of language. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subjects' mind. The manifester can generally force the subjects to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subjects' abilities.  The manifester can give different directions to different creatures. The manifester knows what the subjects are experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from them. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the manifester and subjects are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subjects to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link over a subject so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mass Suggestion (Psionics).MOD		DESC:The manifester influences the actions of the subject creatures by suggesting a course of action (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable. Asking the creatures to do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the power. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested action can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subjects finish what they were asked to do. The manifester can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special action during the duration. If the condition is not met before the power expires, the action is not performed. A very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, and so on) at the discretion of the DM. If manifest on multiple creatures, the same suggestion applies to all these creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Matter Agitation.MOD				DESC:The manifester can excite the structure of a nonmagical object, heating it to the point of combustion over time. If the manifester shifts focus to another object, the first object cools and the second object begins to heat up. 1st Round: Readily flammable materials ignite. Skin reddens (1 point of damage). 2nd Round: Wood smolders and smokes, metal becomes hot to the touch, skin blisters (1d4 points of damage), hair smolders, paint shrivels, water boils. 3rd Round: Wood ignites, metal scorches (1d4 points of damage for those holding metallic objects). Skin burns and hair ignites (1d6 points of damage), lead melts. The manifester can continue to agitate a chosen surface area up to the duration of the power if concentration holds, but can only deal a maximum of 1d6 points of damage against a living or undead subject.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Matter Manipulation.MOD				DESC:The manifester can weaken or strengthen the substance of an object or structure. The power can affect both mundane and magical inanimate material. Weakening an object's substance decreases its hardness and hit points, and strengthening it increases its hardness and hit points. The manifester can increase or decrease an object's hardness by up to 5 from its base hardness. When hardness increases, the object (or portion of an object) gains 3 hit points per inch of thickness per increased hardness. When hardness decreases, the object (or portion of an object) loses 2 hit points per inch of thickness per decreased hardness (to a minimum of 1 hit point/inch of thickness). A manifester can't decrease the hardness (or the hit points) of an object that already has a hardness of 0. Working Manipulated Metals: An object or portion thereof whose hardness is decreased or increased is permanently changed. Metal increased to hardness 15 would possess the strength qualities of mithral. Metal manipulated to hardness 20 would share the special characteristics of a weapon or armor forged of adamantine. Hardening adamantine to 25 is possible, but this confers no benefits other than a higher hardness and more hit points/inch of thickness. A manifester can also harden or weaken a preforged weapon, armor, or other finished item. XP Cost: The item's final hardness x100 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Matter Rearrangement.MOD			DESC:The manifester can transmute one metal into another. The power can affect a metal object up to 1/10 pound, or several metal objects whose total weight does not exceed 1/10 pound. In practical terms, 1/10 pound equals five standard coins. XP Cost: The XP cost equals the gp value of the newly transmuted metal, or a minimum of 1 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Metaconcert.MOD					DESC:The manifester links his or her psychic might with other psions, creating an entity more powerful than the sum of its parts. All participants (up to sixteen total, including the manifester) must be willing; thus, saving throws and power resistance do not apply. Once linked, all the participant's power points flow into a collective pool, the total of which is 20%% more than the sum of the participants' pools. When the power is manifested, one individual is chosen as the lead mind by mutual consent of the other participants. Until the power ends, this "conductor" directs the efforts of the group. Visually, misty strands of glowing power link the brows of all the participants in a complex and shifting pattern. All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity constructed by metaconcert. This entity can't take any more actions than a normal individual, but it manifests all its powers more effectively. Each individual psion making up the entity provides a cumulative +1 bonus to DCs set when manifesting a power (including using a psionic attack mode) and a cumulative +1 bonus when making saving throws against powers (including Will saves against psionic attack modes). If the psionic entity takes temporary ability damage from a psionic attack, the total is divided up among all the members as they see fit. Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-diameter area, and as a group may only move at a speed of 10 feet. Participants can willingly drop out before the overall metaconcert ends, but they come away with 0 power points. Participants who accidentally move beyond the range of the power or who are forcibly removed also end up with 0 power points. When metaconcert ends normally or is dismissed, remaining power points in the pool are evenly divided among all the participants (round down). A manifester does not leave a metaconcert with more power points than he or she joined in with.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Metafaculty.MOD					DESC:The manifester gains exceptional insight concerning any individual or creature whom he or she has previously detected via any other Clairsentience or Telepathy power. For purposes of this power, "ex?ceptional insight" includes a name, a mental image of the subject, the subject's alignment, and the subject's location (an image of the subject's current location that is good enough to teleport to as if studied carefully). Powers, special abilities, and spells do not protect against metafaculty's ability to find the truth, not even mind blank or spells such as wish.  XP Cost: The manifester expends a number of XP equal to the total level (or HD) of the individual focused on x 500. A character can never expend so much XP using metafaculty that he or she would lose a level. If that would be the case, metafaculty simply fails to work.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Metamorphosis.MOD					DESC:The manifester change his or her form to that of another creature or inanimate object. The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the character's normal form, and can have no more hit dice than the character has, and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 hit dice. A character cannot change into constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead unless the character is already are one of these types. Upon changing, the character regains lost hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting for a day; and changing back does not heal the character further). If slain, the character reverts to his or her original form, though he or she remains dead. The character acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature he or she has polymorphed into while retaining his or her own mind. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (not extraordinary or supernatural abilities), and similar gross physical qualities. A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not psionic or magical flight and other psionic or magical forms of travel. Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of extraordinary magical, or psionic ability, so they are not granted by this power. (In general, non-flying speeds greater than 60 and flying speeds greater than 120.) Other mundane abilities (such as low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form. The character's new scores and faculties are average ones for the race or species into which he or she has been transformed.  The character cannot transform into an exceptional or templated creature. The character retains his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change to Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses, as well as the DCs for affected powers.) The character retains his or her own type, extraordinary abilities, psionics, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not supernatural abilities. The character does not gain the supernatural abilities or the extraordinary abilities of the new creature. When the polymorph occurs, the character's equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature who does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties. If the character attempts to take the form of a complex object, he or she must make an appropriate Craft skill check. The character cannot metamorphose into inherently psionic or magical materials or objects, or any object with a hardness of 15 or greater. The character also cannot take the form of a psionically animated mechanism or any sort of object formed of ectoplasm. As an inanimate object, the character loses all mobility; however, he or she retains the ability to manifest powers normally. The character can take damage as an object (but the object's natural hardness, if any, protects the character). The character can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities are also under the character's control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species. The character is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If the character uses this power to create a disguise, he or she gets a +10 bonus on his or her Disguise check. Incorporeal or gaseous forms cannot be assumed, and incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed. A natural shapeshifter (a lycanthrope, doppelganger, experienced druid, etc.) can take its natural form as a standard action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Metaphysical Weapon.MOD				DESC:A weapon gains a +3 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The enhanced weapon glows with pale silver radiance (not sufficient to provide illumination). An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attacks. Alternatively, the power can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must all be of the same type, and they have to be together in one group. Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their enhancement when used.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Microcosm.MOD					DESC:When microcosm is manifested, it can target either a single creature or a group. Targeted: If microcosm targets a single creature, that creature's senses are pinched off from the real world if it has 100 or fewer hit points. The subject's senses are all completely fabricated from within its own mind, though it may not realize this. In reality, the subject sprawls limply and will eventually die of thirst and starvation without aid. However, the subject lives within its own made-up world until the time of its actual death. Area Effect: If microcosm is manifested as an area effect, it sends creatures in a 15-foot-radius sphere into their own (unlinked) catatonias. It affects only creatures that have 30 or fewer hit points, and only up to a total of 300 hit points of such creatures. The power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first until the next creature would put the total over the 300 hit point limit. (Creatures with negative hit points count as having 0 hit points.) Manifesting microcosm a second time on a subject can turn its sensory pathways outward once more. Otherwise, only very powerful psionic powers or similar effects (such as psychic chirurgery or the spell greater restoration) can undo the mental crosswiring that creates a private world.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Blank (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The subject is totally protected from all devices and power that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This protects against all mind-affecting powers and effects, as well as information gathering by Clairsentience powers or effects (except metafaculty). Mind blank even foils extraordinary powers and spells (such as limited wish, miracle, and wish) when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about him or her. In the case of remote viewing or scrying that scans an area that the creature is in, the power works but the creature simply isn't detected. Remote viewing and scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all. Mind blank is not effective against psionic attack modes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mindlink.MOD					DESC:The manifester forges a telepathic bond with other creatures, which must have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher. The bond can be established only with willing subjects, who therefore receive no saving throw and gain no benefit from power resistance. The manifester can communicate telepathically through the bond even if he or she does not share a common language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Probe.MOD					DESC:All the subject's memories and knowledge are accessible to the manifester, from memories deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind. The manifester can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject's knowledge. The manifester can also probe a sleeping subject, though the subject may make a Will save against the DC of the mind probe to wake after each question. Subjects who do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the power's range, unless somehow hindered. The manifester poses the questions telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to the manifester's mind. The manifester and the subject do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to the questions. Creatures protected by mind blank are immune to mind probe.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Seed.MOD					DESC:The manifester impresses the totality of his or her psyche into a subject's subconscious. If successfully implanted, the seed of the manifester's mind "germinates" over the period of one week. During this time, the subject begins to unconsciously take on the manifester's mannerisms. Any time before the seven-day deadline, the mind seed can be purged from the subject's mind with psychic chirurgery or the spell greater restoration (manifesting mind seed again also cleanses the mind). When integration is complete (after seven days), the subject becomes the manifester in mind as he or she was when he or she manifested the power but eight levels lower in experience. The subject does not possess any of the manifester's physical statistics or equipment, but does possess his or her ability scores in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as they were eight levels earlier. The subject also knows the powers the manifester knew at the appropriate level. As soon as the subject becomes the manifester's mental duplicate, the two personalities begin to diverge. Although the subject starts off with the manifester's experiences, he or she possesses his or her original "soul" and physical body and is free to develop his or her own personality based on its own experiences. Thus, the subject is not the manifester's slave or servant, but instead an NPC in his or her own right who shares the manifester's earlier memories. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent a manifester from implanting mind seed. XP Cost: 3,000 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Store.MOD					DESC:This power makes a storage crystal containing the essence of the manifester's living mind (this power can't be used on a dead subject). Until such time as the manifester perishes, the storage crystal is utterly inert. If the manifester is slain at some later date, his or her soul transfers into the storage crystal, which begins to dimly glow. Upon transference, the manifester's physical remains (should they still exist) become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. The transfer from the slain body to the storage crystal works over any distance, physical or extradimensional, unless some sort of special planar geometry supersedes the transfer. Once the storage crystal is activated by the manifester's physical body's demise, the character has the abilities of a psicrystal of the appropriate level, plus all the powers he or she knew and the power points possessed when mind store was manifested, but at one level lower. The character has thirty days to grow an organic body, after which time his or her sentience fades and the character's soul passes on if it hasn't entered a new body. To grow a body, the character (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The body's constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, and slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of the character's body at the time he or she mamifested mind store (the crystal itself slowly breaks down and becomes a part of the new organic body). When the ten days are completed, the character completely and totally inhabits the new body. The character possesses all the abilities he or she possessed when mind store was manifested, at one level lower, but the character has none of his or her equipment. If the growing body is struck for any amount of damage, it is destroyed and the character's soul passes on. Conceivably, a character could manifest mind switch to utilize a temporary body, but only an evil psion would smash the storage crystal with an imbedded mind in order to permanently usurp the subject's organic body (unless the subject is, itself, irredeemably evil).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Switch.MOD					DESC:The manifester can attempt to take control of a nearby living creature, forcing its mind (and soul) into the manifester's body. The manifester may move his or her mind back into his or her own body whenever he or she desirse (which returns the subject's mind to its own body). The power ends when the manifester sends his or her mind back to his or her own body. Attempting to switch minds is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar magical or psionic ward. The manifester possesses the body and forces the creature's mind into the manifester's body unless it succeeds at a Will save. If successful, the manifester's life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force takes over the manifester's. The manifester can call on rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (as can it in the manifester's body). Each retains his or her own alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, class, level, skills, base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, hit points (regardless of new Constitution score), power points (if any), and power resistance (if any). Each gains the new body's Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity scores (including modifiers based on these abilities), as well as natural (but not magical) armor. Neither gains the other's special abilities. As a standard action, the manifester can return to his or her own body, if within range (which ends the power). If the manifester's new body is slain, he or she returns to his or her own body, if within range, and the life force of the original body departs. If the new body is slain beyond the range of the power, the manifester dies, but the switched creature lives on in the manifester's body permanently. If the manifester's body is slain while inhabited by the power's subject, it dies, and the manifester continues to inhabit the new body permanently. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. A successful targeted negate psionics manifested on either switched body causes both minds to return to their original bodies, if within range. If they are out of range, negate psionics has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mindwipe.MOD					DESC:This power bestows one negative level per two manifester levels (maximum five negative levels) to the subject. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as HD, he or she dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of power, spells, or special abilities). The creature also loses 5 hit points. Additionally, a psionic character or creature loses one power from his or her highest available level (a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level). Negative levels stack. Assuming the subject survives, he or she regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to the manifester's manifester level. Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the subject's levels, but the negative levels from mindwipe don't last long enough to do so.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Minor Creation (Psionics).MOD			DESC:This power creates a nonmagical, nonpsionic, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per manifester level. The manifester must succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item. Attempting to use any created object as a material component in a spell causes the spell to fail.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Missive.MOD						DESC:The manifester sends a telepathic message of up to ten words to any living creature within range. Missive is strictly a one-way exchange. If the manifester and subject do not share a common language, the subject "hears" meaningless mental syllables.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Monster Domination.MOD				DESC:The manifester can control the actions of any living creature. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If the manifester and the subject share a common language, the manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subject's abilities. If no common language is shared, the manifester can only communicate basic commands. The manifester knows what the subject is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the manifester and subject are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subject to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
My Light.MOD					DESC:The manifester's eyes produce a 20-foot-long cone of light. The manifester and other creatures can see normally in the light. If the manifester walks into an area filled with psionic or magical darkness, my light goes dark while the manifester stays within it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Natural Armor.MOD					DESC:The manifester's skin grows thick ridges, providing a +4 natural armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, natural armor entails no armor check penalty or speed reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Negate Psionics.MOD				DESC:A manifester can use negate psionics to end ongoing powers that are manifested on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item, or to end ongoing power (or at least their effects) within an area. A negated power ends as if its duration had expired. Negate psionics can negate (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as psionic powers. Negate psionics affects spell-like abilities just as it affects powers (and spells). Negate psionics cannot undo the effects of any power with instantaneous duration. The manifester chooses to use negate psionics in one of two ways: a targeted negation or an area negation: Targeted Negation: One object, creature, or power is the target of the power. The manifester makes a negation check against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. A negation check is 1d20 + 1 per manifester level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the power-to-be-negated's manifester level. If the object targeted is a psionic item, make a negation check against the item's manifester level. If successful, all the item's psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. A character automatically succeedes in the negation check against any power that character manifest him or herself. Area Negation: The power affects everything within a 30-foot radius. For each creature that is the target of one or more powers, make a negation check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that fails, make negation checks against progressively weaker powers until one power is negated (which discharges the negate psionics so far as that target is concerned) or all checks fail. The creature's psionic items are not affected. For each object that is the target of one or more powers, make negation checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by area negations. For each ongoing power with an area centered within the negate psionics target area, make a negation check to negate the power. For each ongoing power whose area overlaps with that of the negation, make a negation check to end the effect, but only within the area of the negate psionics.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nondetection (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by Clairsentience powers or psionic and magic items that allow others to view the subject from afar. If a Clairsentience power is attempted against the warded creature or item, the manifester of the Clairsentience power must succeed at a manifester level check (1d20 + manifester level) with a DC of 11 + the manifester level of the psionic creature or character who manifested nondetection. If the manifester manifested nondetection on him or herself or on an item currently in the manifester's possession, the DC is 15 + manifester level. If manifested on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Null Psionics Field.MOD				DESC:An invisible barrier surrounds the manifester and moves with him or her. The space within this barrier is totally impervious to most psionic effects. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any psionic items or psionic powers within its confines. The field suppresses any powers or psionic effects used within, brought into, or manifested into the area, but does not negate them. Time spent within a null psionics field counts against the suppressed power's duration. Astral constructs wink out if they enter the field (or are inside one when it is created). The construct reappears in the same spot once the null psionics field no longer covers the spot where the construct was. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the power that's maintaining the creature. If the construct has power resistance, when the character manifested the null psionics field the character must make a manifester level check (1d20 + manifester level) against the construct's PR to make it wink out. A psionic weapon does not function psionically within the area, but it is still a weapon (and a masterwork one at that). The power has no effect on constructs that are imbued with psionics during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unlike astral constructs that persist only so long as a power's duration). Undead and outsiders are likewise unaffected (unless summoned). These creatures' psionic powers, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. A negate psionics power does not remove the field. Two or more null psionics fields have no appreciable effect on each other. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal psionics such as this. Note: Should the manifester be larger than the area enclosed by the field, any part of his or her person that lies outside the field is unaffected by the field.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Oak Body.MOD					DESC:This power transforms the manifester's body into living oak. The manifester gains damage reduction 20/+1. He or she is immune to blindness, damage to ability scores, deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all powers, spells, or attacks that affect physiology or respiration, because the character has no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect. The character only suffers three-quarters damage from acid and cold of all kinds. However, the character also becomes vulnerable to all special attacks that affect wood. The character gains a +3 enhancement bonus to Strength, but suffers a -3 enhancement penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum score of 1), and his or her speed is reduced to half normal. The character cannot drink (and thus can't use potions), nor play wind instruments. The character's unarmed attacks deal 1d6 points of normal damage, and he or she is considered "armed" when making unarmed attacks (a Small manifester instead deals 1d4 points of damage). The character's weight increases by a factor of five, but he or she floats in water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Object Reading.MOD				DESC:The manifester can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. The amount of information revealed depends on how long the manifester studies a particular object. 1st Round: Last owner's race. 2nd Round: Last owner's gender. 3rd Round: Last owner's age. 4th Round: Last owner's alignment. 5th Round: How last owner gained and lost the object. 6th+ Round: Previous-to-last owner's race, and so on. An object without any previous owners reveals no information. A manifester can continue to run down the list of previous owners and learn details about them as long as the power's duration lasts. If the manifester reads the same object again, he or she does not pick up where he or she left off in the list of previous owners.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Painful Touch.MOD					DESC:When the manifester makes a successful unarmed attack that deals damage (or in conjunction with any bite or claw powers), he or she deals an additional 1d6 points of subdual damage to the target.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phase Door (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except the manifester, and only the manifester can use the passage. The manifester disappears when he or she enters the phase door and appears when he or she exits. If the manifester desires, he or she can take one other creature (Medium-size or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, psionic effects, or spell effects through it, nor can the manifester see through it without using it. True seeing psionics or magical effects reveal a phase door but do not allow its use. A phase door is subject to negate psionics. If anyone is within the passage when it is negated, he or she is harmlessly ejected out the nerest exit. A phase door can be made permanent with a incarnate power. The manifester can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as desired. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plane Shift (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester moves him or herself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, up to eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Pinpoint accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, the manifester can reach any other plane, though he or she appears 5 to 500 miles (5d%%) from the intended destination. Note: Plane shift transports the creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Poison Sense.MOD					DESC:While the duration lasts the manifester becomes aware of the presence of poison within 30 feet of him or her, and its general location. The character can determine the exact type of poison with a successful Wisdom check (DC 16). A character with the Alchemy skill may additionally try an Alchemy check (DC 16). Note: The power can penetrate barriers of up to 3 feet of stone, 3 inches of common metal, 1 inch of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Polymorph Self (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester changes his or her form to that of another creature. The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the character's normal form, and can have no more hit dice than the character has, and in any case the assumed form cannot have more than 15 hit dice. A character cannot change into constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead unless the character is already are that type. Upon changing, the character regains lost hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting for a day; and changing back does not heal the character further). If slain, the character reverts to his or her original form, though he or she remains dead. The character acquires the physical and natural abilities of the new form: natural size, physical ability scores (average Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for the new form's kind), natural armor, natural weapons, and similar gross physical quantities. A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings. The character does not acquire the extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities of the new form. The character cannot change into variation form of a creature.  Incorporeal or gaseous forms cannot be assumed. The character retains his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma sores, level and class, hit point (despite any change to the character's Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus and save bonuses.  (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.)  The character retains his or her extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not his or her supernatural abilities (if any).  The character can manifest powers, or cast spells for which the character has components, but the character needs a humanlike voice for verbal components and humanlike hands for somatic components. If the character's new form is a fey, giant, humanoid, shapechanger, or undead, the character's equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.  Otherwise, it melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  Melded material components and focuses cannot be used to cast spells.  Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form. The character chooses the form's physical qualities (such as hair color, height, and gender), but they must fall within the normal ranges for the form.  The character is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If the character uses this power to create a disguise, the character gets a +10 bonus on his or her disguise check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Power Resistance.MOD				DESC:This power grants the subject a power resistance (PR) equal to 12 + the manifester's manifester level. In order to affect a creature that has power resistance with a power, roll the creature's power resistance or higher on 1d20 + manifester level. A creature with power resistance may voluntarily lower it in order to accept a psionic effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Power Turning.MOD					DESC:From 7 to 10 (1d4+6) power levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. Each power turned subtracts its level from the amount of power turning left. A power might be only partially turned. Subtract these from the power level of the incoming psionic power. Divide the number of the remaining levels of the incoming power by the power level of the incoming power to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging power, the power turning manifester and the original manifester each suffer a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging powers, each has a proportional chance to be affected. If the manifester and an attacker are both warded by power turning effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result:|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Precognition.MOD					DESC:The precognition power provides the manifester with a useful vision in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within a year. The vision can be as simple as a short glimpse of a meaningful image, or it might take the form of a full-length dream lasting several minutes.  In all cases, the DM controls what information is received. Note that if the party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct precognition is 80%%, plus 1%% per manifester level. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it. If the dice roll fails, the manifester knows the power failed, unless specific psionics or magic yielding false information is at work. Multiple precognitions about the same action by the same manifester use the same die roll result as the first precognition and yield the same answer each time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Probability Travel.MOD				DESC:This power allows the manifester travel to the Astral Plane, and from there to other planes. The manifester can bring other creatures with him or her, provided the creatures are linked in a circle with the manifester at the time of the manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the manifester and must accompany him or her at all times. If something happens to the manifester during the journey, the companions are stranded wherever he or she left them. The manifester physically travels to the Astral Plane, leaving nothing behind. Since the Astral Plane touches upon every other plane, the manifester can travel astrally to other planes. The manifester then leaves the Astral Plane, entering into the plane of existence he or she has chosen. Because the manifester and companions are physically on the Astral Plane, they possess no silver cords and thus are not vulnerable to those who might sever them. However, if a character perishes while out journeying amid the planes, he or she is just as dead as if he or she had perished in his or her home plane. The power lasts until the manifester desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as negate psionics manifested upon the manifester.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Prowess.MOD						DESC:If an enemy provokes an attack of opportunity, the manifester can take it, even if he or she has already taken the allotted number of attacks of opportunity this round. A character may not make two attacks of opportunity against the same target in one round even if using this power, unless the target provokes two separate attacks. A character can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain an extra attack of opportunity in the same round. Manifesting the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Psionic Lock.MOD					DESC:A psionic lock power manifested upon a door, chest, or portal psionically locks it. A manifester can freely pass his or her own lock without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with psionic lock can be opened only by breaking in or by a successful negate psionics or knock power. Add +10 to the normal DC to bash open a door or portal affected by this power. Note that knock does not remove psionic lock; it only suppresses it for 10 minutes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Psychic Chirurgery.MOD				DESC:The manifester can repair psychic damage. He or she can also grant another creature knowledge of powers the manifester knows. Repair Damage: The manifester can remove any compulsions and charms, even those higher than 6th level. The manifester can remove any ongoing or permanent effect caused by a psychic power with psychic chirurgery, save for hit points. The manifester can also restore all drained levels (or disperse all negative levels) afflicting the subject, regardless of how he or she lost those levels, restoring him or her to the highest level he or she had previously achieved. The drained levels are restored only if the time since the subject lost the level is no more than 1 hour per manifester level. These effects end or are reversed as soon as the manifestation time is completed without need for another saving throw. The manifester can also remove all psionic effects penalizing the subject's abilities, heal all temporary damage to all ability scores, and restore all points permanently drained from all ability scores. Psychic chirurgery also removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and so on, but it does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death. Transfer Knowledge: If desired, the manifester can directly transfer knowledge of a power known to another psionic character. A manifester can't give a character knowledge of a psionic power of a level higher than he or she could normally manifest, but the manifester could give him or her knowledge of a power that is not normally on the character's power list. Knowledge of powers granted through psychic chirurgery does not count toward the maximum number of powers a character can know per level. XP Cost: Each time the manifester uses psychic chirurgery to implant knowledge of a power in another creature, the manifester pays an XP cost equal to 3,000 x the level of the power implanted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Psychic Vampire.MOD				DESC:The manifester's successful melee touch attack drains 2 power points/level from the foe and transfers them immediately to the manifester. The manifester can't gain more power points than he or she normally has available in a day. The stolen power points remain in the manifester's reserve until used normally. This touch attack, charged with a psionic power, is treated as an armed attack. Against psionic beings who have no power points, this touch instead deals 1 point of temporary Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (manifester's choice). The manfiester gains 1 power point from this drain. The power has the same effect on nonpsionic opponents.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Psychofeedback.MOD				DESC:The manifester can use power points to boost his or her Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers as a free action. While the duration lasts, the manifester can use power points on a round-by-round basis to boost any or all of his or her ability score modifiers by a number equal to half the power points expended for that round as a free action. A manifester could simultaneously boost two scores, or all three, as long as he or she pays the total power point cost. The manifester doesn't have to boost an ability modifier every round to keep the power in effect-as long as the duration lasts, he or she has the potential to boost ability modifiers on any round he or she chooses.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Psycholuminescence.MOD				DESC:The object touched begins to glow with a silvery light, shedding light in a 20-foot radius. Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them while exposed to this psycholuminescence. The power cannot be manifested on a creature. If the power is manifested on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the power's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Psycholuminescence brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
#
Quintessence.MOD					DESC:The manifester collapses a bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-inch-diameter dollop of thick, gooey material called quintessence.  A character can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any small object, such as a key, a ring, a seal, or an insignia. Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms, they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the timestream. This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round beginning 10 rounds after partial contact begins. Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. Removing the protective film is 75%% likely to force the quintessence to evaporate back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for later usage. Large quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large items or structures (or even a complete living creature, which would prevent the damage taken from partial contact). However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of quintessence weighing 1 pound or more generate a half-strength catapsi effect (DC 16, radius 5 feet, all are affected, including caster).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Recall Agony.MOD					DESC:The target takes 9d6 points of damage as past (or future) wounds impinge briefly on the present.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Recall Death.MOD					DESC:The target dies, suffering mortal wounds from his or her past (or future).  The target is entitled to a Will save to survive the attack. If she succeeds, she instead sustains 3d6+15 points of damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Recall Pain.MOD					DESC:The target takes 3d6 points of damage as past (or future) wounds impinge briefly on the present.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reddopsi.MOD					DESC:When manifesting reddopsi, psionic powers (excluding attack modes) targeted against the manifester rebound on the original manifester. This reverses only powers that have the manifester as a target. Area powers and those that target effects are not affected. Reddopsi also fails to reflect touch range powers. Reddopsi can reverse any power, but ends as soon as it has done so, no matter how minor the power. Should reddopsi reverse a power back on a manifester who also is affected by reddopsi, the power rebounds once more upon the target.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rejuvenation.MOD					DESC:Rejuvenation cures 1 point of temporary ability damage per hour, up to a maximum of 10 points. It does not restore permanent ability drain.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Remote Viewing.MOD				DESC:The manifester can see and hear some creature, who may be at any distance. The manifester must succeed at a Remote View check to do so. The difficulty of the task depends on how well the manifester knows the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) he or she has to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, the manifester gets a -5 penalty on the Remote View check. This power creates a barely detectable translucent image (roughly similar to the manifester's own, but not enough to allow recognition) located near the subject. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or higher can notice the image with a successful Remote View check (or Intelligence check) against DC 20. Missive and darkvision can be manifested through remote viewing. Aura sight can be manifested through remote viewing, but with only a 5%% chance per manifester level of operating correctly.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Remote View Trap.MOD				DESC:When others use power, spells, or other means of observing the manifester from afar, this prepared trap gives them a nasty surprise. Prior to an attempt to view the manifester from afar, he or she and the remote viewer immediately make opposed Remote View checks, but the manifester gains a +10 insight bonus on his or her check. (A Remote View check is the same as an Intelligence check for a creature without the Remote View skill. If opposing a magical scrying, the Remote View check is opposed by the opponent's Scry check.) If the manifester meets or beats the remote viewer's result, the manifester is undetected. Moreover, the would-be observer takes 4d4 points of electricity damage. The manifester is aware of the attempt to view him or her, but not of the perpetrator or the perpetrator's location.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Retrieve.MOD					DESC:The manifester can teleport an item he or she can see within range directly to his or her hand. If the object is in the possession of or held by an opponent, the manifester makes a disarm attempt using a ranged attack, as if with a weapon the same size as the opponent's.  This does not draw an attack of opportunity.  The manifester gains a +12 competence bonus on this attack roll.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Schism.MOD						DESC:The manifester's mind splits into two independent parts. Each part functions in complete autonomy, like two characters in one body. The newly partitioned mind does not control the body physically but is free to take one partial action each round that is completely mental (such as manifesting a power). Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. Both can use psionic powers, even at the same time, although both draw from the same power point pool. All powers manifested by the newly partitioned personality cost a number of power points equal to their standard cost +2. This effect allows the character to take an extra partial action each round, either before or after his or her regular action, as long as that action is the manifestation of a power or some other nonphysical activity. Manifesting powers in threatened areas still provokes attacks of opportunity.  If the manifester is subjected to a compulsion or charm effect while of two minds, make a second saving throw if the manifester fails the first. If both fail, then schism ends and the character is affected normally by the power. If one fails, the other part of the character's mind is still free to act normally. Note: The spell haste does not function on a "split-minded" creature due to its fragmented consciousness. Other spells and powers designated by the DM are likewise unlikely to function, or at the very best, to affect only one of the personalities.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
See Invisibility (Psionics).MOD		DESC:The manifester sees any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any that are astral or ethereal, as if they were normally visible. The power does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility, although an astral traveler is easy to identify if he or she has a silver cord. It does not reveal illusions or enable the character to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures that are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
See Sound.MOD					DESC:The manifester experiences sound translated through visual sensation (by sight). The manifester must be able to see normally or also have feel light active. The manifester's eyes convert sound to light: he or she can see sound even in darkness, as long as some noise is present to give objects shape. The manifester is "blinded" in complete silence. The character's range of sight does not change. If the manifester's ears are working normally, the expanded reception gives a +1 enhancement bonus on all Listen checks. If used in conjunction with feel light, the bonus is +2.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sending (Psionics).MOD				DESC:The manifester contacts a particular creature with whom he or she is familiar and sends a short message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes the manifester if it knows him or her. It can answer in like manner immediately. Creatures with Intelligence scores as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited normally by its Intelligence. Even if the sending is received, the subject creature is not obligated to act upon it in any manner. If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as the manifester is, there is a 5%% chance that the sending does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably, at the DM's option.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sense Link.MOD					DESC:The manifester senses what the subject creature senses. Only one sense is linked, and the manifester may not switch between senses with the same manifestation.  Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the subject creature moves out of the original manifestation range (but the link does not work across planes). The manifester does not control the creature, nor can the manifester communicate with it via this power.  The manifester must concentrate to access the sense link. If he or she does not concentrate, that sense returns to the manifester's own immediate surroundings. The powers of the subject creature's senses could be enhanced by other powers or items, if desired, allowing the manifester the same enhanced sense. The manifester is subject to any gaze attack met by the subject creature (if the linked sense is sight). A successful negate psionics manifested on the manifester or the linked creature ends the power. With respect to the manifester's own blindness, deafness, and so on, the linked creature is an independent sensory organ. When linked to a subject, the manifester make his or her own perception checks, such as Spot and Listen, regardless of the subject's Spot and Listen results, if any.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sense Psionics.MOD				DESC:The manifester detects all psionic activity anywhere within range. He or she knows direction and distance from him or her to within 60 feet and the discipline of the power being used, but no other information is revealed. All powers of 8th level or less are ineffectual in preventing sense psionics from detecting psionic activity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sense Psychoportation.MOD			DESC:The manifester senses the use of various Psychoportation powers and similar spells within the area. The manifester senses the use of these powers whether or not he or she can directly see them. When the manifester senses the use of a specified effect, he or she knows exactly where the creature is using the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sensitivity to Psychic Impressions.MOD	DESC:The manifester gains historical vision in a given location. The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions are those that elicited strong emotions: battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and great pain, or any other event where one emotion dominates. Everyday occurrences leave no residue for the manifester to detect. The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. The manifester does not gain special knowledge of those involved in the vision, though he or she might be able to read large banners or other writing if they are in an understood language.  The manifester can sense one distinct event per round of concentration, if any exist at all. This sensitivity extends into the past a number of years equal to 100 x the manifester's level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sequester (Psionics).MOD			DESC:This power not only prevents Clairsentience powers from working to detect or locate the creature or object affected by sequester, it also renders the affected creature or object invisible to any form of sight or seeing. The power does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Living creatures (and even undead creatures) affected by sequester become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the power wears off or is negated. Note: The Will save prevents a character from being sequestered. There is no saving throw to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a Clairsentience power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sever the Tie.MOD					DESC:This power disrupts an undead creature's tie to the Negative Energy Plane, damaging or destroying the creature. The power deals 3d8 points of damage to all undead within the area. Undead that are brought to 0 hit points or below by use of the power fall limply and molder into dust (if corporeal), or slowly disperse (if incorporeal).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Body.MOD					DESC:The manifester's body and all equipment are subsumed by his or her shadow, which grants the character several powerful resis?tances and abilities. As a living shadow, the character blends perfectly into any other shadow and vanish in darkness. The character appears as an unattached shadow in areas of full light. He or she can move at his or her normal speed, but can move on any surface, including walls and ceilings, as well as across the surfaces of liquids-even up the face of a waterfall. While in shadow form, the character can be detected by powers that detect thoughts, life, or presences (including true seeing), or by suspicious movements in lighted areas. The character cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any object, but can use psionic powers normally. Using psionic powers may attract notice, but if the character remains in a shadowed area, he or she adds +15 to Hide checks. The character is nearly undetectable in darkness (although certain power displays could briefly pinpoint the exact location). The character gains damage reduction 50/+5. He or she is immune to blindness, critical hits, damage to ability scores (except if that damage comes as a result of psionic combat), deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all powers, spells, or attacks that affect his or her physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect. The manifester only suffers half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, he or she also becomes vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shapechange (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester change his or her form to that of any single creature of less than deity status (including unique dragon types, or the like) or any single object. The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension. This power allows incorporeal forms to be assumed.  The character can become just about anything he or she is familiar with. The character can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before the character's regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action. Upon changing, the character regains lost hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting for a day; and changing back does not heal the character further). If slain, the character reverts to his or her original form, though he or she remains dead. The character acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature he or she has polymorphed into while retaining his or her own mind. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (not supernatural abilities), and similar gross physical qualities. The character also gains the extraordinary abilities of the new form.  A body with extra limbs does not allow a character to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not psionic or magical flight and other psionic or magical forms of travel. Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of extraordinary magical, or psionic ability, so they are not granted by this power. (In general, non-flying speeds greater than 60 and flying speeds greater that 120.) Other mundane abilities (such as low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole does not revert to its original form, thus a creature's poison is effective. The character's new scores and faculties are average ones for the race or species into which he or she has been transformed.  The character cannot transform into an exceptional or templated creature.  The character gains the new form's type in place of his or her own. The character retains his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change to Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses, as well as the DCs for affected powers.) The character retains his or her own extraordinary abilities, psionics, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not supernatural abilities. The character does not gain the supernatural abilities of the new creature. When the polymorph occurs, the character's equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature who does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties. The character can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities are also under the character's control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species.  The character is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If the character uses this power to create a disguise, he or she gets a +10 bonus on his or her Disguise check.A natural shapeshifter (a lycanthrope, doppelganger, experienced druid, etc.) can take its natural form as a standard action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shield of Prudence.MOD				DESC:The manifester's awareness extends a few fractions of a second into the future. The character gains a +6 insight bonus to AC. If the character is caught flat-footed, shield of prudence still grants a +4 insight bonus to AC.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Skate.MOD						DESC:The manifester, another willing creature, or an unattended object can slide along solid ground as if on smooth ice. If skate is manifested on the manifester or another creature, the subject of the power retains equilibrium by mental desire alone, allowing him or her to skate along the ground, turn, or stop suddenly as desired. The subject's base speed is equal to his or her normal speed +15 while the duration lasts. The subject can skate up or down any incline or decline he or she could normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up an incline reduces the subject's speed to the normal rate, while skating down a decline adds +30 to the skater's normal speed. This benefit counts as an enhancement bonus. If manifested on an object, treat the object as weighing only one-tenth of its normal weight for purposes of dragging it along the ground.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spider Climb (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have bare hands and feet to climb in this manner. The subject climbs at half its speed. A creature with a Strength score of at least 20 +1 per manifester level can pull the subject off a wall.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Steadfast Gaze.MOD				DESC:The manifester gains immunity to all gaze attacks while the duration lasts.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Steadfast Perception.MOD			DESC:The manifester gains a +4 enhancement bonus on saving throw to resist all figments, glamers, and other illusory effects. Moreover, the manifester's Spot and Search skills receive a +2 enhancement bonus while this power remains in effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stomp.MOD						DESC:This power creates a shock wave that travels along the ground, toppling creatures and loose objects. The area is conelike but extends in only two dimensions, flat along the ground (creatures in the air above the shock wave are not affected). All creatures standing in the area who fail their Reflex saves are thrown to the ground and take 1d4 subdual damage in the process. Rising from a prone position is a move-equivalent action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sudden Minor Creation.MOD			DESC:This power creates a nonmagical, nonpsionic, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per manifester level. The manifester must succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item.Attempting to use any created object as a material component in a spell causes the spell to fail.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Suggestion (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester influences the actions of the subject creature by suggesting a course of action (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the power. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested action can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what he or she was asked to do. The manifester can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special action during the duration. If the condition is not met before the power expires, the action is not performed. A very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, and so on) at the discretion of the DM.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Suspend Life.MOD					DESC:The manifester can place him or herself into a trance so deep that all his or her life functions are essentially halted. Even powers that detect life or thought are incapable of determining that the character yet lives. While suspended, the character feels the passage of one day for every year that actually passes. Though on a slower schedule, the character grows hungry after a "day" without food (though a year may pass in actuality) and begins to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as appropriate. The character is also aware of his or her surroundings, though events that take less time than 10 minutes occur too quickly for the character to note them. If the character takes damage, he or she comes out of the trance in 4 rounds. If the character chooses to come out of the trance voluntarily, it takes 10 rounds. Once the character leaves the trance, he or she must manifest this power once more to return to a state of suspension.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sustenance.MOD					DESC:The manifester can go without food and water for one day.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tailor Memory.MOD					DESC:The manifester inserts a memory of his or her own choosing in your subject's mind. A manifester can insert a memory of up to 1 round duration per four manifester levels. The manifester chooses when the fake event occurred any time within the last week. The manifester can't read the subject's memory with this power. Tailoring a memory is tricky, because if it is not done right, the subject's mind recognizes the "memory" as false. Dissonance occurs if the manifester inserts a memory that is out of context with the subject's past experience. The subject gains a bonus of +1 to +4 to his or her saving throw, depending on the magnitude of dissonance created by specifying an out-of-context memory, as determined by the DM.  Likewise, inserting a memory of the subject taking an action against his or her nature grants a +1 to +4 bonus, depending on the type of memory inserted. Inserting a memory that couldn't possibly be true causes the power to fail automatically.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Talons.MOD						DESC:The manifester's unarmed attacks deal +1 damage (normal instead of subdual damage). Equally important, the character is considered armed and thus does not draw an attack of opportunity for an unarmed attack. The +1 damage bonus stacks with the base damage granted by the various claw powers.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telekinesis (Psionics).MOD			DESC:The manifester moves objects or creatures by concentrating on them. The power can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust (manifester's choice). Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to 25 pounds per manifester level up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with power resistance. This version of the power lasts up to 1 round per manifester level, but it ends if the manifester ceases concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond the range of the power. The power ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If the manifester ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. The manifester might even be able to untie simple knots, though fine actions such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the telekinetic power can be expended in a single round. The manifester can hurl one or more objects or creatures that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet/level of all the objects. A manifester can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per manifester level. The manifester must succeed at attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using his or her base attack plus Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds for hard, dense objects. Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the power can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the power. If creatures are telekinetically hurled against solid surfaces, they take damage as if they had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telekinetic Sphere (Psionics).MOD		DESC:A globe of force encloses a creature or object, provided it is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the power's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a third eye negate (or similar magical items), disintegrate, or a targeted negate psionics power. These destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subjects can breathe normally. Creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within a telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. The manifester can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs up to 5,000 pounds. Telekinetic control extends to a maximum distance of medium range from the manifester (100 feet + 10 feet per manifester level) after the sphere has actually encapsulated its contents. The manifester moves objects or creatures in the sphere by concentrating on them. The sphere begins moving the round after manifesting the power. A round's concentration (a standard action) moves the sphere up to 30 feet. If the manifester ceases concentrating, the sphere does not move that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, the power's duration ends, or the manifester begins concentrating again. Because of the reduced weight, the sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to its contents. If the manifester ceases concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), he or she can resume concentrating on his or her next turn or any later turn during the power's duration. The manifester can move the sphere telekinetically even if he or she is in it. Note that even if more than 5,000 pounds of weight is englobed, the perceived weight is only one-sixteenth of the actual weight, so the sphere can be rolled without exceptional effort.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telempathic Projection.MOD			DESC:The manifester can alter the subject's mood. An affected creature feels the new emotion, but telempathic projection cannot radically change its emotional state. Instead, the power adjusts its emotions by one step. The manifester can grant up to a +1 bonus on his or her own (or others') attempts at Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform actions with affected creatures, assuming the manifester adjusts the subject's emotions in the proper direction (the manifester could also inflict a -1 penalty on similar interactions).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Teleport (Psionics).MOD				DESC:This power instantly transports the manifester to a designated destination. Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible. The manifester can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per manifester level. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and power resistance. The manifester must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical, psionic, or magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. Note: Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d%% and consult the table below. Familiarity: "Very familiar" is a place where the manifester has been very often and where he or she feels at home. "Studied carefully" is a place known well, either because the manifester has been there often or has used other means  to study the place. "Seen casually" is a place that the manifester has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that the manifester has seen once, possibly using psionics. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance are know through someone else's description, perhaps even from a precise map. "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%%, since there is no real destination for the manifester to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target: The manifester appears where he or she wants to be. Off Target: The manifester appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10%% of the distance that was to be traveled. Similar Area: The manifester winds up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, the manifester appears in the closest similar place, but since the power has no range limit, he or she could conceivably wind up somewhere else across the globe. Mishap: The manifester and anyone else teleporting with him or her have gotten "scrambled." Each character suffers 1d10 points of damage, and reroll on the chart to see where the characters wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time "Mishap" comes up, the characters suffer more damage and must reroll.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Teleportation Circle (Psionics).MOD		DESC:This power creates a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports (with no chance for error) any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once the manifester designates the destination for the circle, it can't be changed. The power fails if the manifester attempts to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which the manifester is not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane. The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If the manifester intends to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, he or she needs to mark the circle in some way. The DC for a rogue (only) to use the Search skill to find the circle and thwart it with Disable Device is 34.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Teleport Trigger.MOD				DESC:The manifester specifies a situation whereby he or she automatically manifests a teleport power to a predetermined location (the manifester must know the teleport power and have sufficient power points to pay its cost). The teleport occurs on the initiative count immediately after the specified situation, even if the manifester is flat-footed or if he or she has already taken a normal action. Specified situations can be general or specific. Otherwise, rules for teleportation work normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Teleport without Error (Psionics).MOD	DESC:This power instantly transports the manifester to a designated destination. Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible. The manifester can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per manifester level. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and power resistance. The manifester must have at least a reliable description of the place to which he or she is teleporting. If the manifester attempts to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), he or she disappears and simply reappear in the original location.  Areas of strong physical, psionic, or magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. Note: Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Temporal Acceleration.MOD			DESC:The manifester speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still mov?ing at their normal speeds. The manifester is free to act for 2 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, acid, and the like can still harm the manifester. While temporal acceleration is in effect, other creatures are in?vulnerable to the manifester's at tacks and pow?ers; however, he or she can manifest powers and leave their effects to appear when the temporal velocity pow?er ends. (The powers' durations do not begin until the temporal velocity duration is over.)The manifester cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in the standard time frame, but can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession. The manifester is undetectable while temporal velocity lasts. He or she cannot enter an area protected by a null psionics field or by powers or spells that neutralize high-level powers or spells. When temporal acceleration lapses, the manifester is disoriented on his or her return to the standard time frame. He or she suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Temporal Velocity.MOD				DESC:The manifester speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still mov?ing at their normal speeds. The manifester is free to act for 3d4 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, acid, and the like can still harm the manifester. While temporal velocity is in effect, other creatures are in?vulnerable to the manifester's at tacks and pow?ers; however, he or she can manifest powers and leave their effects to appear when the temporal velocity pow?er ends. (The powers' durations do not begin until the temporal velocity duration is over.) The manifester cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in the standard time frame, but can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession. The manifester is undetectable while temporal velocity lasts. He or she cannot enter an area protected by a null psionics field or by powers or spells that neutralize high-level powers or spells. When temporal velocity lapses, the manifester is disoriented on his or her return to the standard time frame. He or she suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for half the number of rounds (round down) he or she was accelerated.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thrall.MOD						DESC:The manifester permanently controls the actions of any humanoid of Medium-size or smaller. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If the manifester and the subject share a common language, the manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subject's abilities. If no common language is shared, the manifester can only communicate basic commands. The manifester knows what the subject is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a penalty of -10.  If the subject succeeds at the save, the action is not taken, but the subject remains under the manifester's control. Once a subject of thrall makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty.  Obviously self-destructive orders may be carried out if the above save is failed. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the manifester and subject are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subject to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it. The only way to dissolve thralldom is through the successful manifestation of another thrall power, manifested with the intention of freeing the thrall, or the successful use of the spell disjunction. XP Cost: 5,000 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Time Hop.MOD					DESC:The subject of the power hops forward in time 3d6 rounds (always into the future, never into the past). In effect, the subject seems to disappear, then reappear after 3d6 rounds. The subject reappears in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. For the subject, no time has passed at all. If the space from which the subject departed is occupied upon his or her return to the time stream, he or she appears in the closest unoccupied space, still in his or her original orientation. Deter?mine the closest space randomly if necessary.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Time Regression.MOD				DESC:The manifester can regress apparent time 1d4+1 rounds into the past. The power regresses time to the point along the timestream when the manifester first began manifesting the power (the manifester still has to pay the XP cost of the power, however). Once the manifester has regressed, only he or she retains knowledge of the next 1d4+1 rounds; however, the manifester can communicate that knowledge verbally to companions, if desired. During the rounds that the manifester lives through a second time, he or she can act on knowledge gained by living through the immediate future.  XP Cost: Each manifestation costs 500 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trace Teleport.MOD				DESC:The manifester can trace the origination or destination of any teleportation made by others within the area. He or she can trace both psionic and magical teleportations. The manifester must pierce the power resistance of creatures that possess it for a successful trace, but the creature conducting the teleportation can make a Will save to foil the trace. For purposes of this power, "trace" means the manifester could teleport to the location him or herself if so desired (and knew the teleport power), as if he or she had "seen casually" the trace location. This power does not grant any information on the conditions at the other end of the trace beyond mental coordinates.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trinket.MOD						DESC:This power creates a nonmagical, nonpsionic, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic inch. The manifester must succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item. Attempting to use any created object as a material component in a spell causes the spell to fail. The manifester cannot create a dried herb, poison, or other distillate of dead plant matter that has a special secondary effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Concussion.MOD				DESC:The target is pummeled with for 13d6 points of ? damage. The manifester may choose to have the power deal an equal amount of subdual damage instead.True concussion always affects a subject within range that the manifester can see, even if the subject is in melee or has partial cover or concealment. Inanimate objects cannot be damaged by the power.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Creation.MOD					DESC:The manifester creates a nonmagical, nonpsionic, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable or mineral matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per manifester level. The manifester must succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item. Items created are permanent and cannot be negated by dispelling magic or negating powers. For all intents and purposes, these items are completely real.  XP Cost: The XP cost equals 10 times the cost of the item in gold pieces, or a minimum of 1 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Domination.MOD				DESC:The manifester can control the actions of any humanoid of Medium-size or smaller. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If the manifester and the subject share a common language, the manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subject's abilities. If no common language is shared, the manifester can only communicate basic commands. The manifester knows what the subject is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a penalty of -10.  If the subject fails the save, the action is carried out, but on a success the power is broken. Obviously self-destructive orders may be carried out if the above save is failed. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the manifester and subject are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subject to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Metabolism.MOD				DESC:The manifester regenerates 10 hit points every round for 1 minute.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Seeing (Psionics).MOD			DESC:This power confers on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical or psionic darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic or psionics, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, sees through falsified sensory input, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus his or her vision to see into the Ethereal Plane. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not cancel concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures that are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the power effects cannot be further enhanced with known psionics or magic.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Telekinesis.MOD				DESC:The manifester moves objects or creatures by concentrating on them. The power can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust (manifester's choice). Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object weighing up to 500 pounds per manifester level up to 100 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with power resistance. This version of the power lasts up to 1 round per manifester level, but it ends if the manifester ceases concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond the range of the power. The power ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If the manifester ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. The manifester might even be able to untie simple knots, though fine actions such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the telekinetic power can be expended in a single round. The manifester can hurl one or more objects or creatures that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet/level of all the objects. A manifester can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per manifester level. The manifester must succeed at attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using his or her base attack plus Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds for hard, dense objects. Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the power can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the power. If creatures are telekinetically hurled against solid surfaces, they take damage as if they had fallen 160 feet (16d6 points).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ubiquitous Vision.MOD				DESC:This power grants the manifester reduced penalties and bonuses in specific situations. In effect, the manifester has a 360-degree sphere of sight, allowing him or her perfect view of creatures that might otherwise flank the manifester. Thus, flanking opponents gain no bonus on their attack rolls instead of +2, and rogues are denied their sneak attack because the character does not lose his or her bonus to Dexterity (but they may still sneak attack if the character is caught flat-footed). The character's Spot checks gain a +3 enhancement bonus, and his or her Search checks gain a +1 enhancement bonus. Concurrently, the character suffers a -4 enhancement penalty on saves against all gaze attacks during the power's duration.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ultrablast.MOD					DESC:The manifester "grumbles" psychically for 1 round (which both psionic and nonpsionic creatures can detect), then release a shriek that deals 13d4 points of damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undead Sense.MOD					DESC:The manifester senses the presence of undead. While the duration lasts, the manifester becomes aware of the presence of undead within the affected space and their general location. The type of undead is not revealed, but numbers are.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Valor.MOD						DESC:The manifester can immediately apply a +1 morale bonus on a saving throw. A character can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain the +1 morale bonus on a saving throw in the same round. Manifesting the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Verve.MOD						DESC:The manifester gains 1 temporary hit point.  This hit point does not stack with temporary hit points from other sources or with additional uses of verve.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vigilance.MOD					DESC:The manifester gains the ability to see 30 feet in total darkness, fog, silty water, dust-laden air, and similar vision-impairing media. Vision is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight. In magically obscured regions, such as magical darkness or fog, vigilance allows the character to see only 10 feet. The power does not grant the ability to see through solid objects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vigor.MOD						DESC:The manifester gains 3 temporary hit points per manifester level (maximum 18 hit points).  These hit points do not stack with temporary hit points from other sources or with additional uses of vigor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Ectoplasm.MOD				DESC:The manifester fashions a wall of ectoplasm, imbuing it with solidity. The wall cannot move and is immune to damage of all kinds. Wall of ectoplasm is susceptible to powers that negate psionics, but it gains a +4 bonus on any check to determine if the wall is negated. Spells, powers, and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although psychoportive travel can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). The wall is opaque, so neither vision nor gaze attacks operate through it. The manifester can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level or into a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per level. The wall of ectoplasm must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the power fails.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Whitefire.MOD					DESC:Whitefire deals 5d4 points of fire damage to all creatures within the area the manifester designates (he or she must be able to see the target area or a portion of it). Unattended objects also take damage. Whitefire sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with a low melting point.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

###Block: Attack Modes
# Spell Name	Description
Ego Whip.MOD	DESC:The defender makes a Will save (DC 1d20 + manifester's Dexterity modifier + DC modifier). Psionic creatures are allowed to raise a psionic defense mode, which modifies the defender's Will save DC. Those who fail their saving throw take 1d4 points of temporary Dexterity damage. Nonpsionic creatures always enjoy a nonpsionic buffer against a psionic attack mode (see Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers). On a failed saving throw, nonpsionic creatures are stunned for 1d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Id Insinuation	DESC:The defender makes a Will save (DC 1d20 + manifester's Strength modifier + DC modifier). Psionic creatures are allowed to raise a psionic defense mode, which modifies the defender's Will save DC. Those who fail their saving throw take 1d2 points of temporary Strength damage, regardless of mental hardness. Nonpsionic creatures always enjoy a nonpsionic buffer against a psionic attack mode (see Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers). On a failed saving throw, nonpsionic creatures are stunned for 1d2 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Blast.MOD	DESC:This attack blasts the minds of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Defenders within the area make a Will save (DC 1d20 + manifester's Charisma modifier + DC modifier). Psionic creatures are allowed to raise a psionic defense mode, which modifies the defender's Will save DC. Those who fail their saving throw take 1d4 points of temporary Charisma damage. A nonpsionic creature's buffer is less helpful against mind blast than other psionic attack modes. The Will save DC increases by +4, and on a failed saving throw, a nonpsionic creature is stunned for 3d4 rounds (rather than 1d4).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Thrust.MOD	DESC:The defender makes a Will save (DC 1d20 + manifester's Intelligence modifier + DC modifier). Psionic creatures are allowed to raise a psionic defense mode, which modifies the defender's Will save DC. Those who fail their saving throw take 1d2 points of temporary Intelligence damage. Nonpsionic creatures always enjoy a nonpsionic buffer against a psionic attack mode (see Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers). On a failed saving throw, nonpsionic creatures are stunned for 1d2 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Psychic Crush.MOD	DESC:The defender makes a Will save (DC 1d20 + manifester's Wisdom modifier + DC modifier). Psionic creatures are allowed to raise a psionic defense mode, which modifies the defender's Will save DC. Those who fail their saving throw take 2d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage. Nonpsionic creatures always enjoy a nonpsionic buffer against a psionic attack mode (see Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers). On a failed saving throw, a nonpsionic creature is stunned for 2d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Empty Mind.MOD		DESC:A manifester can raise empty mind as a reaction in response to a psionic attack mode, even if he or she has already taken the full allotment of actions for the round (unless the manifester is flat-footed or out of power points).  Cross-reference this defense with the attack mode on Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers to get the appropriate modifier to the Will save DC.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Intellect Fortress.MOD	DESC:A manifester can raise intellect fortress as a reaction in response to a psionic attack mode, even if he or she has already taken the full allotment of actions for the round (unless the manifester is flat-footed or out of power points).

Mental Barrier.MOD	DESC:A manifester can raise mental barrier as a reaction in response to a psionic attack mode, even if he or she has already taken the full allotment of actions for the round (unless the manifester is flat-footed or out of power points). Cross-reference this defense with the attack mode on Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers to get the appropriate modifier to the Will save DC. The manifester also gains mental hardness 2, which is applied against any temporary ability damage dealt by the attack mode if the manifester fails his or her Will save (except against id insinuation).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thought Shield.MOD	DESC:A manifester can raise thought shield as a reaction in response to a psionic attack mode, even if he or she has already taken the full allotment of actions for the round (unless the manifester is flat-footed or out of power points). Cross-reference this defense with the attack mode on Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers to get the appropriate modifier to the Will save DC. The manifester also gains mental hardness 1, which is applied against any temporary ability damage dealt by the attack mode if the manifester fails his or her Will save (except against id insinuation).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tower of Iron Will.MOD	DESC:A manifester can raise tower of iron will as a reaction in response to a psionic attack mode, even if he or she has already taken the full allotment of actions for the round (unless the manifester is flat-footed or out of power points).  Cross-reference this defense with the attack mode on Table: Psionic Combat DC Modifiers to get the appropriate modifier to the Will save DC. The manifester and those within the area also gain mental hardness 2, which is applied against any temporary ability damage dealt by the attack mode if the manifester fails his or her Will save (except against id insinuation). Because tower of iron will has an area, it specifically grants mental hardness (but not a DC modifier) to other living, willing creatures against a psionic attack. These bonuses stack.  Nonpsionic creatures within the area also gain this mental hardness, which shields them from potential rounds of being stunned instead of temporary ability damage, on a point-for-point basis.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
