I've worked through a lot of this, and I'm sure there are going to be more issues... but every step, right?

Artifacts:
1.) The sorcere blades have been coded as individual, unfortunatly I'm unaware of any tag to list the protection that they offer to the weilder
2.) Same as above, but also there are two long swords that have no special name...

Specific Armor:
1.) Shifting Armor (I don't really think I need to say any more) if someone would like to take a hack at it, feel free.

Specific Melee:
1.) I'm working on getting the pick of halfling to recognize dwarfes and small people
2.) The sword of rage thing has me completely befuddled (perhaps it's because I'm tired)

Potions:
1.) While the .pdf has a small list of possible potions, the main idea behind the quick write-up is that you can make any spell a potion (and that is just too much work (seeing as we keep adding more spells into the mix)

Wondrous Items:
1.) The Demiform Boots are way over my head, and possibly too much for PCGen's capabilities at the present moment.  If someone wants a challenge I'm all for you attacking this small (but insanely tough) section.

Rods, Staves, and Wands:
1.) The Rod of Punishment is interesting because it acts as two seperate weapons with different +'s to hit and damage... I'm working on getting an idea of how to fix this.
