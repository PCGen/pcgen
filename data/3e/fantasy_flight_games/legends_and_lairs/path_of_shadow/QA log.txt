missing OGL.txt

*.pcc
missing PCGen's S15 declaration

*all class files
class name and game stats are declared OGC, so these are
fine...since that's all that PCGen uses.

*spells
new spells look good. where are the new powers for the psychic
thief on pp 128-9? i didnt' see them in the spells file, nor did i
see a spells psionic file.

*feats
the new feats look good, as they are declared OGC

*equip (mundane and magical)
looks good, as all names and game stats are declared OGC

*skils
looks good

I noticed the schools from ch 5 weren't included (at least not
yet). The mechanics from that chapter are OGC. Have folks thought
of how to implement these, as each of the Path books have them.

If not got much but I thought I'd start with the core classes. Only done one
so I'll post it.

Chameleon

text says Crossbow (Hand) OR Crossbow (Light). Should this be a choice?

If so you can use the tag: WEAPONBONUS:Crossbow (Hand)|Crossbow (Light)

Disguise bonus should be TYPE=Competence

DEFINE:Disguises|2 works but could be replaced with:

DEFINE:Disguises|(CL=Chameleon+10)/5
Then you would not need additional bonus statements

Special abilities - I noticed you cleared the class prerequisites. This does
not mess up anything else does it?

All fixed.
Special abilities -

That shouldn't be a problem. If nothing else, a PREVAR check to make sure
the person qualifies for them anyway... I think the reason for the PRExxx
in the first place was because VISIBLE:NO didn't work in all display modes
of feats, and I didn;t want to make it easy for a plain joe to be able to
get the feat just because he had it in a different view mode than I normally
test in..... :)

Blithwyn: Leaving them as is for now, the alternative is to duplicate them instead
          or adding a qualifying variable in SRD.
