Specifically it will alert you to        work-arounds for Spycraft rules that PCGen does not currently support.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nationalities</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you select your department        the first pop up chooser will let you select your characters nationality.        This will apply a template which specifies your nationality and will grant        you an additional bonus language if your native countries language is something        other than English. The Nationality template can be removed and replaced with        another as people in the modern age will occationaly immagrate though the        bonus language granted with your original choice will not be removed. You        can only apply one Nationality at a time. The list is by no means complete,        if you wish to add additional nationalities edit the spycraft_templates.lst        file to add the nationality template. Edit the spycraft_feats_hidden.lst file        to add additional choices to the list that appears when you choose a department.        The Language list is also incomplete, you can add them by editing the spycraft_languages.lst        file. </font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Skills</font></h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intimidate and Sport have multiple        key abilities in Spycraft though PCGen only supports one. Intimidate defaults        to CHA and Sport defaults to DEX. To use the other stat you will have to make        the adjustment with the old pencil and paper.</font></p>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The skills 'Hobby (Untrained)'        and 'Sport (Untrained)' are listed to keep the skill list uncluttered and        cannot be selected. Although all sport and hobby skills are usable untrained        only these two will show up when skills are exported with 'show untrained        skills' selected. </font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Backgrounds</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Backgrounds appear in the skill        list though they are not skills and are never used as such. They are in the        skill list because they are purchased with skill points. The rules say you        can have no more than 5 points in no more than 2 backgrounds at any one time.        PCGen does not enforce this rule. Once the background is resolved or 'cashed        in' it is suggested that you transfer the skill points into the skill named        'Resolved Backgrounds'.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Languages</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Languages are treated a little        differently in Spycraft and some work arounds are used to comply with the        Spycraft rules. It is suggested that you create a new note in the description        tab to keep a list of which languages your character speaks natively and another        for those picked up by making a language check. Languages your character starts        with are considered native. Any languages learned through the language skill        can become native by spending an additional skill rank on it. To do this purchase        one rank of the Native Language Skill corresponding to that language. The        Native Language Skill will add one rank to the Languages Skill but no additional        languages. The Native Language Skills is a work-around, you should always        use your Languages score for skill checks. Adding more then one rank of any        Native Language Skill will not add any additional ranks to Languages, so don't        do it. </font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Feats</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some advanced skill feats build        on the basic skill feats a PC may already have. <strong>Advanced Skill Mastery</strong>        lets you choose a basic skill feat and improves on the bonuses provided by        the basic skill feat. Grand Skill Mastery and Perfect Skill Mastery works        in much the same way only you must select the same basic skill feat as you        did for the Advanced Skill Mastery feat. PCGen cannot limit the users selection        of these feats so it is up to the user to make sure they have the required        feat. For Example a PC can choose the feat Acrobatic and then choose Advanced        Skill Mastery which lists Acrobatic and any other basic skill feats the PC        has to choose from. The problem comes when the PC chooses the feat Grand Skill        Mastery, he will again be presented with the same list of basic skill feats        even though he should be limited to the feats chosen through Advanced Skill        Mastery, this is where you must be careful to select the same feat as was        chosen for Advanced Skill Mastery. If the PC does choose a different feat        the benefits will only amount to what they would be if he choose Advanced        Skill Mastery for the feat so there is no reason (cheat wise) to do this.</font></p>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Training</strong> grants        you 4 additional skill points, however PCGen cannot add these. You may add        these points manually by changing the number in the &quot;Skill Points left        for Class&quot; field on the Skills Tab.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Purchasing Equipment</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PCGen cannot yet deal with multiple        currency systems like that used in Spycraft. Items in Spycraft have a budget        point value or a gadget point value as well as a monetary value if purchased        on the street. This dataset lists items in either budget points or gadgets        points. The first Type listed for every item is either Gear, Gadget or Vehicle.        Gear type items are bought with Budget Points and Mission Budget points while        Gadget and Vehicle type items are bought with Gadget Points. PCGen cannot        tell the difference between the two and does not restrict your purchasing,        it is up to the user to determine his or her budgets and stay within them.        This is especially important if you customize a gear item with a gadget modification,        the customizer will add the modification cost (in gadget points) to the cost        of the gear item (in budget points) and the resulting cost will be incorrect.        You can see your characters budgets in the lower right pane in the Class Tab.        Street values are not listed.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modifying Equipment</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some gadgets and vehicles can be        modified with additional capabilities. To do this right click on the item        to bring up the customizer. The modifications will be listed and can be added        to the item for an additional cost. Please note that Spycraft places some        limits on the number of modifications that can be added to certain items.        PCGen does not restrict the number of modifications you can add though the        Spycraft rules do. Please read the rules to determine the limits.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Equipment</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get the full benefits of <strong>Tiger        claws</strong> you must equip your PC with a pair, one on each hand. Using        one will only give you half of the bonuses.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vehicles</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PCGen will output the correct stats        for your chosen vehicle but you must set things up in a certain way for it        to output correctly. Most importantly you must Equip the vehicle to the character        in the equipping sub-tab, setting the vehicle to not carried or another setting        will not activate the vehicle stats. Secondly you may only equip one vehicle        at any one time, the reason for this is that PCGen cannot, at this time, assign        variables to objects and so all variables are associated with your character.        What this means is that if you equip you character with 2 or more vehicles        that output sheet will still only have one vehicle block but the stats will        equal the combined totals of all the vehicles you have. Equipping the vehicle        to your character does not add any weight or take up any slots from your character        not does any items you may put in the vehicle. Vehicles are containers that        do not have any restrictions on what they may contain, I leave that to you,        your Game master and common sense.</font></p>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Customizing vehicles. You may add        gadgets and other refinements to your vehicle by customizing it. Find the        vehicle in the equipment list and right click it to choose create custom object.        You will be presented with a list of refinements you can add to the vehicle.        PCGen will not limit the number of these items you can add to the vehicle,        again its up to you and your GM to follow the rules. When output the OS will        display the number of gadgets as well as the maximum number of gadgets that        can be added to that type of vehicle.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using the Output Sheet</font></h3><blockquote>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this time there is an html sheet        and a pdf template. The text set in the tab name field of the summery tab        will output as the characters code name. You can find the Spycraft html Output        Sheet in the Modern/HTML folder, it is named csheet_spycraft_std.htm. The        Spycraft pdf Output Sheet can be found in the Modern/PDF folder, it is named        csheet_spycraft_std.fo. </font></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
