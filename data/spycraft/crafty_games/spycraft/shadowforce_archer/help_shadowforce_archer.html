Specifically it will alert you to     work-arounds for Spycraft rules that PCGen does not currently support.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chambers</font></h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> <blockquote>   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Chambers are represented in     PCGen by a series of templates which can be found in the bottom pane of the     department tab. They are mutually exclusive as your PC may only belong to     only one at a time. You will need to choose one manually and they are removable.     Any option which has membership in a certain Chamber as a requirment will     use these templates to test for qualification. Your PC's chosen Chamber will     appear on the output sheet in the list of Templates.</font></p>  </blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Class Abilities</font></h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> <blockquote>   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Psion classes have an ability     called Psi Mastery, which allows the psion to chooses a psion skill that he     has at least 1 rank in and gain a bonus in. At this time PCGen will produce     a list of all skills the character has ranks in and cannot at this time limit     the list to just those psionic skills the character has ranks in, its up to     you to select the approprieate skill.</font></p></blockquote><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Feats</font></h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> <blockquote>   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several of the basic psion feats     provide enhancments to a choosen psionic skill the character has ranks in.     For that reason you should spend you skill points before taking any of these     feats. Also note that PCGen will produce a list of all skills the character     has ranks in and cannot at this time limit the list to just those psionic     skills the character has ranks in, its up to you to select the approprieate     skill.</font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The feat <strong>Heightened Inner     Strength</strong> is a compicated one that cannot be fully supported. The     main problem is that the feat applies bonuses to the PC every five levels     after the level the PC has choosen the feat and there is not mechanism in     PCGen to test for which level the feat was added. As a work around there is     a second feat in the list named <strong>Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses</strong>     which will allow you to apply the bonuses manually. The first time you add     the Heightened Inner Strength feat you will be given the choice of which ability     to enhance and one feat slot will be used. At the apropreite level you can     add the next ability enhancement by choosing <strong>Heightened Inner Strength     Bonuses</strong> which will offer the same choices but will not cost you a     feat slot. This method used six hidden feats each of which can add up to 2     points to an ability and in that regard the rules are enforced. Because of     the way this is set up it has the potential to incorrectly add points to your     feat pool. If you choose the <strong>Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses</strong>     feat and do not choose an ability bonus, one point will be incorrectly added     to you feat pool. You can also use the <strong>Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses</strong>     feat to remove bonuses but bear in mind that this too will incorrectly add     points to your feat pool.</font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The feat <strong>Evolved Mind</strong>     feat will add skill points to your highest Mentalist class level, so if you     have multi-classed the points will not appear in your current class skill     point pool if that class is not Mentalist. Use the 'Skill point left for class'     pop up menu to find your highest Mentalist level and spend those points there.     Since this feat makes all skill class skills for the Mentalist it does not     matter where there are spent.</font></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
