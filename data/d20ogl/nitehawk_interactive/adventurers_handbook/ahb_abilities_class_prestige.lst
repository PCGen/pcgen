# How the heck to implement Improved Swimmer ?

#Improved swimmer (Ex): The shark charmer must become a strong swimmer in order to survive at sea. He gains a +6
#bonus to all swim checks, and can hold his breathe underwater for an additional 8 rounds underwater before incurring
#penalties. The shark charmer does not suffer the normal penalties of other swimmers; other swimmers suffer double
#the normal armor check penalties or double the normal encumbrance penalties while swimming. Improved swimmers
#only suffer the normal armor check penalty or encumbrance penalty while swimming. Furthermore, he suffers only half
#the penalties when attacking underwater; that is -1 to attacks with slashing or bludgeoning weapons and three-quarters
#damage. Piercing weapons are always unaffected. Ranged weapons normally suffer a -2 to attack penalty for each 5 feet of
#distance in addition to range penalties; the improved swimmer only suffers -1 to ranged attacks underwater for each 5 feet
#of distance in addition to normal range penalties.

#Shark Empathy - This acts as a  Diplomacy skill check to improve the attitudes of sharks.
#The DC is the shark charmer's level plus his Charisma modifier plus the Shark Empathy bonus.
#	What Shark Empathy bonus???  What value?  They just defined a DC...
