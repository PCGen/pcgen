# Feel For Weapon - +2 only applies to a specific weapon OWNED by the character; another of the same type would not suffice
# Gladiator - -2 to opponents AC when they're wearing medium or heavy armor
# Improved Hit Dice does not check to see if already maxed at d12; also if user clicks HP button
# Improved Hit Dice: if user clicks HP button and Okay button, increase will disappear if roll was higher than base die
# Primitive Craft Class Skill: Used to allow Primitive Guardians and Traders to select a Craft Skill (any) to be a class skill.
# Primitive Craft Skill Bonus: Used to allow Primitive Scavs and Thinkers to select +2 Bonus to Craft (any), which are already class skills.

# Primitive Raider Mechanics Bonus: Used to allow a Primitive Raider to select +2 Bonus to Craft (Mechanics), which is already a class skill.
