82nd Airborne			TYPE:EliteUnit			PREFEAT:2,Jump School,MOS Infantry/Rifleman 1																												PRETEXT:Active Duty or Reserve (US Army)		DESC:The 82nd Airborne has become so famous for the exploits of its paratroopers that its WWI history is almost completely forgotten.

In 1942, the 82nd became the first airborne division in the U.S. Army, and was redubbed the 82nd Airborne. The 82nd Airborne earned a near-legendary status in WWII, participating in operations such as 'Neptune', the airborne compliment of 'Overlord' (Neptune was the airborne assault of Normandy, while Overlord was the amphibious assault), and operation 'Market Garden', a combined assault by three airborne divisions to seize and hold key roads and bridges deep in German territory. The 82nd Airborne is based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and holds dear two nicknames earned in WWII: 'Devils in Baggy Pants', taken from a German soldier's diary, and 'America's Honor Guard', a title bequeathed on the unit by General George Patton.
