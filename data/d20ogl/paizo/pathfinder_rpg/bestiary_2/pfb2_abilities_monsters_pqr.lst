This ward has a maximum of %1 hit points, but starts at %2.  Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 hit point, all damage in excess of that which would reduce it to 1 hit point is instead dealt to its soul ward.

Breath Weapon	KEY:Breath Weapon ~ Ravener		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:A ravener keeps the breath weapon of the base creature - the save DC for this breath weapon is now Charisma-based.  In addition, a ravener's breath weapon bestows 2 negative levels on all creatures in the area.  A successful Reflex save halves the damage and reduces the energy drain to 1 level.  The save DC to remove these negative levels is equal to the ravener's breath weapon DC.  The ravener adds 1 hit point to its soul ward ability for each negative level bestowed in this way.

Soul Magic		KEY:Soul Magic ~ Ravener		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:A ravener retains the base creature's spellcasting capability, adding three levels to the base creature's caster level.  This increases the number of spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses all spell slots.  Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast any one of its spells known, it consumes a number of hit points from its soul ward equal to the spell slot level necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels for metamagic feats and so on).  If the soul ward has insufficient hit points, the ravener cannot cast that spell.  Casting a spell that reduces its soul ward to exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener (though most are not comfortable without this buffer of soul-energy and try to replenish it quickly).
