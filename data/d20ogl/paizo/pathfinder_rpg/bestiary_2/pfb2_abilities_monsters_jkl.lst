Burble			KEY:Burble ~ Jabberwock				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:JabberwockBurbleDC|0	DESC:A jabberwock can burble once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action.  This blast of strange noises and shouted nonsense in the various languages known to the jabberwock (and invariably some languages it doesn't know) affects all creatures within a 60-foot-radius spread - these creatures must make a DC %1 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds.  Alternatively, the jabberwock can focus its burble attack to create a 60-foot line of sonic energy that deals 20d6 points of sonic damage (DC %1 Reflex save for half).  The confusion effect is mind-affecting; both are sonic effects.|JabberwockBurbleDC	BONUS:VAR|JabberwockBurbleDC|10+TL/2+CHA	BONUS:VAR|JabberwockBurbleDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Burble)	SOURCEPAGE:p.168

Fear of Vorpal Weapons	KEY:Fear of Vorpal Weapons ~ Jabberwock	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weakness.Extraordinary							DESC:A jabberwock knows that a vorpal weapon can kill it swiftly.  As soon as it takes damage from a vorpal weapon, a jabberwock becomes shaken for 1 round.

Whiffling			KEY:Whiffling ~ Jabberwock			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary						DESC:A jabberwock's wings and violent motions create a significant amount of wind whenever it makes a full attack action.  These winds surround the monster to a radius of 30 feet, and are treated as severe winds - ranged attacks take a -4 penalty when targeting a jabberwock while it is whiffling, and Medium creatures must make a DC 10 Strength check to approach the creature.  Small or smaller creatures in this area that fail a DC 15 Strength check are blown away.  See page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for further details on the effects of severe winds.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.168

Captivating Lure										KEY:Captivating Lure ~ Kelpie					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:KelpieCaptivatingLureDC|0	DESC:Once per day, a kelpie can use a powerful mental attack to lure in a single creature within 60 feet.  The target must make a DC %1 Will saving throw or become captivated by the kelpie, thinking it is a desirable woman in mortal danger or (if in hippocampus or horse form) a valuable steed.  A victim under the effects of the captivating lure moves toward the kelpie using the most direct means available.  If the path leads it into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril; the victim does not consider water a dangerous area, and will enter the water even if it cannot swim or breathe.  A captivated creature can take no actions other than to move toward the kelpie and defend itself, even if it is drowning.  A victim within 5 feet of the kelpie simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks.  This effect continues as long as the kelpie is alive and the victim is within 1 mile of the kelpie.  This is a mind-affecting cham effect.|KelpieCaptivatingLureDC	BONUS:VAR|KelpieCaptivatingLureDC|10+TL/2+CHA	BONUS:VAR|KelpieCaptivatingLureDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Captivating Lure)	SOURCEPAGE:p.172

As a free action, a korred can cause its long hair to reach out and interfere with adjacent creatures - tugging at clothes and weapons, tangling feet and arms, tickllling, and generally making a nuisance of itself.

This counts as using Intmidate to demoralize an oppnenet, and is an extraordinary ability.  The krenshar can emit a loud screech while peeling back its skin, causing potent fear in a single creature within 100 feet that can see the krenshar.  The target creature must make a DC %1 Will save or become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken (if the target has more than 6 Hit Dice) for 1d4 rounds.  A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same krenshar's skullface ability for 24 hours.

The first time each round that she strikes a foe with a melee weapon, she also drains 1 point of Wisdom.  A DC %1 Will save negates the Wisdom drain.

A Leng spider's venom causes flesh to blister and rot away and the mind to experience vivid and horrific hallucinations - these visions cause the poisoned creature to react in an unpredictable manner, as if confused.  The hallucination element of this poison is mind-affecting.|LengSpiderPoisonDC																																									BONUS:VAR|LengSpiderPoisonDC|10+TL/2+CON	BONUS:VAR|LengSpiderPoisonDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Poison)	SOURCEPAGE:p.176	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(bite)
Web Weaponry	KEY:Web Weaponry ~ Leng Spider	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary						DESC:A Leng spider is talented at using its webs to construct masterwork weapons.  This technique of weapon creation allows the spider to effectively create a flail or bolas by attaching a heavy object such as a rock or chunk of metal to a cord of webbing.  The spider attaches one end of this webbing to a leg and can then wield the weighted cords as a masterwork flail or a massterwork bolas.  It can only wield one such weapon at a time - it must use its other legs to walk.  If a Leng spider drops or loses a web weapon, it can create a new one as a full-round action, provided it has access to heavy-weight objects of the correct size (such as loose rocks or skulls).

When the leucrotta calls out, the targets must make a DC %1 Will save or fall under the effects of a suggestion to approach the sound of the leucrotta's voice.  This effect functions identically to a mass suggestion spell with a caster level of %2.  A creature that saves cannot be affected again by the same leucrotta's lure for 24 hours.  The lure is a language-dependent effect, and if the leucrotta uses the victim's name during the lure, the victim takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.  This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect.|LeucrottaLureDC|TL	BONUS:VAR|LeucrottaLureDC|10+TL/2+CHA	BONUS:VAR|LeucrottaLureDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Lure)																SOURCEPAGE:p.178

# Ability Name	Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type						Define					Description																																																																																																																																	Modify VAR					Source Page		Aspects
Blend With Light	KEY:Blend With Light ~ Lurker in Light	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Defensive.Supernatural								DESC:In areas of bright light, lurkers are invisible.  As with greater invisibility, they may attack and still remain invisible.  In shadowy illumination, a lurker loses this invisibility, though like all creatures in shadows, they have concealment unless the viewer has darkvision.  If the lurker is flying, its fluttering wings partially negate this effect, giving it only partial concealment (20%%) rather than total concealment.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.180
Daylight Door	KEY:Daylight Door ~ Lurker in Light		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:Once per day, a lurker can use dimension door, transporting only itself and up to 50 pounds of material.  The start and end points of the teleport must be in areas of bright light; if the destination lacks sufficient light, the teleport fails but does not expend the ability for the day.

Ritual Gate		KEY:Ritual Gate ~ Lurker in Light		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:By sacrificing one or more humanoid victims, a lurker or group of lurkers can create a gate to the Material Plane, one of the Elemental Planes, or the realm of the fey, either to return home or to conjure allies.  Creating a gate for travel requires the sacrifice of five victims - the gate created remains open for 1 minute.  Creating a gate to bring allies to the Material Plane requires one sacrifice for every HD of the creature intended to pass through the gate (so five sacrifices can bring a lurker or a Medium air elemental, eight can bring a Large earth elemental, and so on).  The sacrifices do not need to be simultaneous; as long as all sacrifices occur at some point during the hour-long ritual, the magic continues to build until it reaches the required total.
