As a standard action, an olethrodaemon that begins its turn with an opponent grappled in either of its mouths can swallow the opponent by succeeding on another grapple check.

The creature can attempt to cut its way out of the olethrodaemon's stomach, but it suffers the chance of just cutting into another stomach chamber. An olethrodaemon's stomach is AC 20 and has 40 hit points.  Once a creature deals enough damage to allow escape, it has a 50%% chance to end up in another stomach chamber instead of escaping.  Due to the multiple stomach chambers, an olethrodaemon can house and drain up to four medium creatures at one time. This ability otherwise functions as the swallow whole special attack.

Earth Glide		KEY:Earth Glide ~ Magma Elemental	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ModifyMovement.Extraordinary	DESC:A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water.  Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished.  A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage.  This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round.  The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after %1 rounds.  At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.|TL	SOURCEPAGE:p.118
