This is a supernatural polymorph effect.
Combat Patrol										TYPE:Combat																														PREATT:5												PREFEAT:2,Combat Reflexes,Mobility																																																																																																																												DESC:You range across the battlefield, dealing with threats wherever they arise.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you may set up a combat patrol, increasing your threatened area by 5 feet for every 5 points of your base attack bonus.

SOURCEPAGE:p.156	BENEFIT:When you use the total defense action while using a light, heavy, or tower shield, you can provide a cover bonus to AC against all attacks to an adjacent ally your size or smaller.

SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect.

Crossbow Mastery										TYPE:Combat																																											PREFEAT:3,Point-Blank Shot,Rapid Reload,Rapid Shot																																																													PRESTAT:1,DEX=15																																																										DESC:You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in melee with little fear of reprisal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took Rapid Reload no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.
Dastardly Finish										TYPE:Combat																																																																																																																														PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttack,5																																										DESC:You can take advantage of an enemy's debilitated state to attempt a coup de grace.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:You can deliver a coup de grace to cowering or stunned targets.

SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:You can choose to take a -5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to daze opponents you hit with your melee attacks for 1 round, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + your base attack bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn.
Dazing Spell										TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																											DESC:You can daze creatures with the power of your spells.																																																																ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become dazed for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the daze effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Will save to negate the daze effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A dazing spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.
Deep Drinker										TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Drunken Master ~ Drunken Ki																					PRECLASS:1,Monk=11																																																																								PRESTAT:1,CON=13																																																										DESC:You draw greater amounts of ki from your libations.

SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can disarm your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may disarm your opponent as if from the disarm combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Disrupting Shot										TYPE:Combat																																					PRECLASS:1,Fighter=6			PREFEAT:1,Point-Blank Shot																																																																	PRESTAT:1,DEX=13																																																										DESC:With a well-placed shot, you make it harder for a nearby opponent to cast spells.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:If you ready an action to shoot an opponent casting a spell within 30 feet and successfully hit that opponent with a ranged attack, the concentration DC to successfully cast the spell is increased by +4.
Disruptive Spell										TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																											DESC:Your magical energies cling to enemies, interfering with their spellcasting.																																																												ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.157	BENEFIT:Targets affected by a disruptive spell must make concentration checks when using spells or spell-like abilities (DC equals the save DC of the disruptive spell plus the level of the spell being cast) for 1 round. Targets that avoid the spell's effects avoid this feat's effect as well. A disruptive spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Diviner's Delving										TYPE:General																																										PREFEAT:1,Spell Focus (Divination)																																																																																																																												DESC:Your keen magical intuition makes reading signs, portents, and mystical clues quick and easy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.158	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks with divinations to overcome spell resistance or effects that impede divination (for example, nondetection). When using a divination spell that requires concentration, you gain information from the spell 1 round sooner than normal (so you gain information from the first 2 rounds with 1 round of concentration, and information from the third round in the second round of concentration).
Dreadful Carnage										TYPE:Combat																														PREATT:11												PREFEAT:2,Power Attack,Furious Focus																																																															PRESTAT:1,STR=15																																																										DESC:Slaying an enemy demoralizes your other nearby foes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.158	BENEFIT:Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a free action. Enemies that cannot see both you and the enemy you reduced to 0 or fewer hit points are unaffected.
Duck and Cover										TYPE:Teamwork																																																																																																																																																																											DESC:Your allies assist you in avoiding certain attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.158	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, and both of you are required to make a Reflex saving throw against a spell or effect, you may take the result of your die roll or that of your ally (your modifiers still apply to the roll, regardless of which result you take). If you take your ally's result, you are knocked prone (or staggered on your next turn, if you are already prone or cannot be knocked prone). In addition, you receive a +2 cover bonus to your AC against ranged attacks as long as your ally is wielding a shield.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.158	BENEFIT:An ectoplasmic spell has full effect against incorporeal or ethereal creatures.

SOURCEPAGE:p.166	BENEFIT:You receive a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take 10 on your Disguise check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.

SOURCEPAGE:p.166	BENEFIT:You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats).

On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt to knock them prone. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. If you decide to attempt to knock the target prone, the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a DC %1 [10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier] to avoid the effect. You may attempt a punishing kick attack %2/day [for every four levels you have attained (but see Special)], and no more than once per round.|PunishingKickDC|PunishingKickTimes

SOURCEPAGE:p.168	BENEFIT:You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. A reach spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher. Spells modified by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks. Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.

SOURCEPAGE:p.173	BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can trip your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may knock your opponent prone as if from the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop your weapon to avoid being tripped.
Under and Over										TYPE:Combat																																											PREFEAT:1,Agile Maneuvers																																														PRESIZELTEQ:S																																																																													DESC:You can slip under a foe trying to grab you, knocking him off balance.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.173	BENEFIT:If an opponent larger than you attempts to grapple you and fails, you may make a trip attack as an immediate action against that opponent with a +2 bonus. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Underfoot											TYPE:Combat																																											PREFEAT:2,Dodge,Mobility																																														PRESIZELTEQ:S																																																																													DESC:You slip under and around your larger foes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.173	BENEFIT:You receive a +4 dodge bonus on Acrobatics checks to move past opponents without provoking attacks of opportunity, so long as they are larger than you. In addition, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a larger opponent's threatened area (this stacks with the +4 bonus provided by Mobility, for a total bonus of +6).
Verminheart											TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wild Empathy																																																																																																																																																														DESC:You have a special bond with things that creep, crawl, skitter, and sting.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	BENEFIT:You may target vermin with spells and special abilities that only affect animals (although they are still affected by spells targeting vermin as well). You may use wild empathy to influence vermin as easily as you influence animals.
War Singer											TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bardic Performance																																																																			PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Orc																										PRESTAT:1,CHA=13																																																										DESC:Your songs draw upon the savage chants and brutal ways of your people, inspiring those around you to new heights of violence and savagery.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.173	BENEFIT:When you use bardic performance with audible components on a battlefield (any area where a combat involving a dozen or more combatants is taking place), the range or area of your chosen performance is doubled. In addition, the DC for saving throws against your bardic performance is increased by +2 for creatures of the orc subtype, regardless of where the performance occurs.
Well-Prepared										TYPE:General																																																																																	PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Halfling																																																																																					DESC:Somehow, you always seem to have the right tools or supplies close at hand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	BENEFIT:Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in gold pieces to "happen" to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a f lask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry-if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specif ic items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benef its of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and "acquire" new items. You must pay of these items normally. Special - At the GM's option, a character can substitute the Survival skill for Sleight of Hand with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.
