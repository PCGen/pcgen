###Block: Aluum abilities
# Ability Name	Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type								Define						Description																				Modify VAR										Source Page		Aspects			Description of the Benefits
Immunity to Magic	KEY:Immunity to Magic ~ Aluum	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Immunity								DESC:A aluum is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.58	ASPECT:Immunity|Magic	BENEFIT:An aluum is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature. A magical attack that uses negative energy (such as inflict light wounds or enervation) deals no damage, but speeds up the golem's attacks and movement as if it were under the effects of a haste spell, lasting 1 round per spell level of the attack (attacks that do not have a spell level have no effect on the aluum). A magical attack that uses positive energy slows the aluum as if by a slow spell and dispels any haste effect currently affecting it. A magic jar spell confuses the creature for 1d6 rounds.
Paralysis		KEY:Paralysis ~ Aluum		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:AluumParalysisDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	DESC:The touch of an aluum paralyzes living creatures that fail a Fortitude save (DC %1). The effect lasts for 1d4 minutes.	BONUS:VAR|AluumParalysisDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Paralysis)	SOURCEPAGE:p.58					BENEFIT:This special attack renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Paralysis works on the body, and a character can resist it with a Fortitude saving throw DC %1. Unlike hold person and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a new save each round.|AluumParalysisDC
Soul Shriek							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:AluumSoulShriekDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	DESC:A aluum's enslaved souls emit a wailing sound in a 15 ft. cone causing 6d6 sonic damage and are stunned for 1 round.	BONUS:VAR|AluumSoulShriekDC|2|						SOURCEPAGE:p.58					BENEFIT:As a free action every 1d4 rounds, the aluum's enslaved souls may emit a keening wail in a 15-ft. cone in front of the aluum. Creatures in the cone take 6d6 points of sonic damage and are stunned for 1 round. Creatures that make their save (Will DC %1) take half damage and are not stunned. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.

Erupt			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:A sand eel that has buried itself in the sand can quickly erupt from the ground and attack.											SOURCEPAGE:p.61	BENEFIT:A sand eel that has buried itself in the sand can quickly erupt from the ground and attack. This counts as a charge, except the sand eel can only move its speed (not twice its speed), and it gains a +2 on its attack roll (in addition to the normal bonuses and penalties for charging).
Sandwalking		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:Sand eels travel across sand, quicksand, gravel, and other areas with loose, small debris as if traversing normal ground rather than difficult terrain.

###Block: Ghul abilities
# Ability Name	Unique Key			Category of Ability		Type						Bonus to skill												Source Page		Description of the Benefits
Change Shape	KEY:Change Shape ~ Ghul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:A ghul's natural form is that of a donkeyhoofed undead janni. It always has the same appearance and traits in this form. It can also assume the form of a hyena. A ghul remains in one form until it chooses to assume the other one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does a ghul revert to its natural form when killed. A ghul does not detect as undead while in its hyena form. A true seeing spell, however, reveals its undead form if it is in hyena form.
Cursed Claws					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:A ghul's wickedly curved claws are as hard as steel and count as both cold iron and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.
Genie-Kin						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:For all effects related to race, a ghul is considered a genie even though it is no longer an outsider.
Rend			KEY:Rend ~ Ghul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:A ghul that hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This automatically deals an extra 2d6+6 points of damage.
Skills		KEY:Skills ~ Ghul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	BONUS:SKILL|Listen,Search,Spot|8	BONUS:SKILL|Survival (Find or follow tracks)|8	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:A ghul has a +4 racial bonus to Listen, Search, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus to Survival checks when following tracks. They have a +8 racial bonus to Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 while climbing, even if rushed or threatened.
Bleed			KEY:Bleed ~ Ghul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:Any living creature damaged by a ghul's claws continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. A critical hit does not multiply this bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the bleed damage. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check.

###Block: Greater Ghul
#Great ghuls have all of the powers and abilities of normal ghuls, plus the following:
#DR 10/cold iron and good, Improved Initiative and Toughness as bonus feats, greater invisibility (CL 11th, self only) as a spell-like ability, change shape (allowing any humanoid forms in addition to ghul and hyena form), create spawn, plus one ability related to its original genie type (heat, metalmorph, water's fury, or whirlwind).

Change Shape		KEY:Change Shape ~ Greater Ghul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																								BENEFIT:Allowing any humanoid forms in addition to a ghul's natural form is that of a donkeyhoofed undead janni. It always has the same appearance and traits in this form. It can also assume the form of a hyena. A ghul remains in one form until it chooses to assume the other one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does a ghul revert to its natural form when killed. A ghul does not detect as undead while in its hyena form. A true seeing spell, however, reveals its undead form if it is in hyena form.


# COMMENT: Not all the raises are coded up. djinn, efreet, marid, or shaitan
Heat				KEY:Heat ~ Greater Ghul				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.GenieSelection																						BENEFIT:As a free action, a great ghul can raise its body temperature to that of molten iron or lower it to that of cold, undead f lesh. A great ghul's red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold when grappling. Only a great ghul that was once an efreeti can have this ability.
Metalmorph			KEY:Metalmorph ~ Greater Ghul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.GenieSelection																						BENEFIT:As a standard action, a great ghul may warp and deform any one metal object within 20 feet. This functions like warp wood, but affects only metal objects that fail a DC 18 Fortitude save (attended objects use their wielder's saves). Armor or shields lose half their bonus to AC (enhancement bonuses are unaffected), and weapons are rendered useless except as improvised clubs. The transformation lasts 1 minute, after which the affected metal reverts to its normal state. The save DC is Charismabased. Only a great ghul that was once a shaitain can have this ability.
Water's Fury		KEY:Water's Fury ~ Greater Ghul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.GenieSelection																						BENEFIT:As a standard action, a great ghul may fire a jet of water in a 60-foot line. The water deals 1d6 hit points of damage and blinds anyone it hits for 1d6 rounds. A successful Ref lex save (DC 18) means a creature takes half damage and is not blinded. The save DC is Charismabased. Only a great ghul that was once a marid can have this ability.
Whirlwind			KEY:Whirlwind ~ Greater Ghul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.GenieSelection																						BENEFIT:As a standard action a great ghul can transform itself into a whirlwind of air, bone shards, and pieces of gristle, with its head f loating about. A great ghul's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the great ghul enters the space another creature occupies. Any creature sharing a space with the whirlwind or attacking it with natural weapons takes 1d6 hit points of damage. Any living creature that begins its turn in the whirlwind's space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based. Returning to its normal form is a standard action. Only a great ghul that was once a djinni can have this ability.
