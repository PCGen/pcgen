#Original entry by Frank Kliewe

#Alternate Weapon Gadget: AUTO:EQUIP won't take (%)LIST or (%)CHOICE for substitution, therefore the user will have to add the second weapon
#by hand. As the 2nd weapon needs to be fully paid and will have the same weight when linked with the first one, this is not a big problem.
#A problem is, that the user will not be able to wield both weapons at the same time. This should be mentioned in the Source Help Docs

#Autoloader Module Gadget has box magazin or power pack for ammo feed as prerequisite. We could go over every weapon in modern and add a TYPE
#for this, but I don't think it's worth to clutter up our weapons with another TYPE just for that. Better to let the user sort it out.

#The ITYPE:Alternate granted by Alternate Weapon Gadget is necessary, because that EQMOD is a prerequisite for Booby Trapped Gadget (Trigger
#Integrated Weapon). Basically that one should include the AWG, but I cannot include an EQMOD in another one, so I made it a prerequisite.

#I have only included TYPE=Goods in the Integrated Equipment Gadget and Multiple Use Item Gadget choosers. It is my interpretation of what
#makes sense there. Follwing the exact wording of the rules though, any non-weapon choice would be eligible. Maybe add that?

#The Miniaturized and Compact Gadgets should reduce the size of the item. BONUS:SIZEMOD would only affect creature size? Went SPROP for that
#matter.

#Rangefinding Laser Scope Gadget: BONUS:EQMWEAPON|RANGEMULT doesn't take fractions. Had to go SPROP there as well.

#As with Mecha there are some EQMODS here that can be taken multiple times. Makes having a MULT:YES for EQMODS even more interesting.

#Satellite Datalink Gadget is restricted to "gear containing computerized communications equipment". I'm using PRETYPE:1,Electronic,Surveillance
#but that includes a few items that wouldn't be eligible.

#The Storage Compartment Gadgets would need the ability for an EQMOD to change the item, which it is getting applied to, into being a container.

#Sound Suppressor Gadget for items has the text for weapons in it. That is an error in the MSRD.
