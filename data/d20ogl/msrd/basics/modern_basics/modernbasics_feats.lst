# Need to figure out how best to handle the Brawl and Combat Martial Arts feat trees.
#	These modify tohit, damage, critmult and critrange of Unarmed Strike.
#	It's a bit more complicated than SW because lethal and non-lethal damage dice
#	could be different for the same attack.

# Fixed the Brawl/Martial Arts problem by adding a template 'Unarmed Lethal Strike' that includes a Natural Attack of the same name,
# to get a second object for outputting the differing results. The Brawl and Martial Arts feats now modify the two 'unarmed' objects
# accordingly  																		- Frank Kliewe

# Haven't looked at how classes group the feats into bonus feats yet.
