###Block: Additional Feats from the Divine Characters section of the RSRD
# Feat Name					Description
Blindsight (5 ft Radius).MOD		DESC:Using senses such as acute hearing and sensitivity to vibrations, you detect the location of opponents who are no more than 5 feet away from you.
Disguise Spell.MOD			DESC:You have mastered the art of casting spells unobtrusively, mingling verbal and somatic components into its music and performances so that others rarely catch you in the act of casting a spell.
Divine Might.MOD				DESC:As a free action, spend one of your turn or rebuke undead attempts to add your Charisma bonus to your weapon damage for 1 full round.
Divine Vengeance.MOD			DESC:You can spend one of your turn undead attempts to add 2d6 points of sacred energy damage to all your successful melee attacks against undead until the end of your next action.
Energy Substitution.MOD			DESC:You choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. When employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you can modify the spell to use your chosen type of energy instead.
Extra Music.MOD				DESC:You can use your bardic music four extra times per day.
Eyes in the Back of Your Head.MOD	DESC:Attackers do not gain the usual +2 attack bonus when flanking you.

Hold the Line.MOD				DESC:You may make an attack of opportunity against a charging opponent who enters an area you threaten.
Jack Of All Trades.MOD			DESC:You can use any skill untrained, even those that normally require training.
Knock Down.MOD				DESC:Whenever you deal 10 or more points of damage to your opponent in melee, you make a trip attack as a free action against the same target.
Persistent Spell.MOD			DESC:A persistent spell has a duration of 24 hours.
Plant Control.MOD				DESC:You can rebuke or command plant creatures as an evil cleric rebukes undead.

Power Control.MOD				DESC:When using the weapon you selected, you gain a +4 bonus on the roll to confirm a threat.
Reach Spell.MOD				DESC:You may cast a spell that normally has a range of touch at any distance up to 30 feet.
Repeat Spell.MOD				DESC:A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round of actions.
Sacred Spell.MOD				DESC:Half of the damage dealt by a sacred spell results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy or similar magic.
Sharp Shooting.MOD			DESC:Your targets only receive a +2 bonus to Armor class due to cover.
Subdual Substitution.MOD		DESC:When employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you can modify the spell to deal subdual damage instead of the indicated type of energy damage.
Superior Expertise.MOD			DESC:When you use the Combat Expertise feat to improve your Armor Class, the number you subtract from your attack and add to your AC can be any number that does not exceed your base attack bonus.
