### THE IMPORTANT READ ME FILE ###

Gamemode folders MUST ALWAYS be in the main gamemode folder.
This "dummy" folder is included outside the gamemode folder cause it will make PCGen have
load errors if placed inside the gamemode folder

ALL gamemode folders have the same file names inside each one. There isn't a unique 
naming system like the datasets. The FOLDER NAME is what your gamemode will appear to display
in PCGen. That is the ONLY unique identifier for gamemodes.

This "dummy" gamemode folder is meant to be a guide and learning tool to see
how the gamemode folder should be set up.


This is a "work-in-progress" and will continue to be updated as new and exciting changes
come into the gamemode arena. The more recent example of this in the 5.14 development line is
the ABILITYCATEGORY tag. This is a really exciting tag, and soon it will be allowed to function
within the dataset pcc files, scheduled around the 6.0 series.

NOTE: For any pcgen file to function you must follow the standard conventions. NO SPACES preceeding or at the end of tags or names.
TABS are the ONLY method for separating TAGs. Spaces will cause errors.
COMMENT Symbol '#' or known as the pound sign, tells PCGen to ignore all writing, tags, etc after the # symbol on the line. The 
# sign MUST be the first character in the line.


IF you have any questions about this or any other aspects of customization please, contact 
the PCGen volunteers on the pcgenlistfilehelp yahoo group. We are more than happy to answer
all questions.

Sincerely,

Andrew A. Maitland
