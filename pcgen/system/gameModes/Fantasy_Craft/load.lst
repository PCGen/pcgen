#Heavy Load: Your Defense decreases by 2, you suffer a -2 penalty with physical skill checks, and you move at only 1/2 Speed (rounded up).
#Overloaded: Your Defense decreases by 5, you suffer a -5 penalty with physical skill checks, and you can't move at all, not even with a Bonus 5-ft. Step.
#You can dead-lift or -lower up to twice your maximum heavy load but cannot move while doing so. You can push or drag up to twice your maximum heavy load at 1/4 Speed (rounded down), or clear up to 3 ? your maximum heavy load in rubble or brush per minute (each square may be filled with 2,000 lbs. of loose debris or half that amount of brush).
#Encumbrance limits may be improved with a Push Limit check (see page 70).
