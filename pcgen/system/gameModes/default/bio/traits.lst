[PHRASE]
...but I'm feeling MUCH better now.
A -oh, oh -a
A god was chasing me, so I ran.
A part of me is gone and it's never coming back.
A pentagram and a reindeer? You figure it out, folks.
A really good place to bring your kids up.
Again with the finger!
Again?
Ah I see you've decided to do psycho. God speed.
Ah! My heart!
Ahhh, Ricky...
Alcoholism sure is a hoot.
Allright? S'allright!
Am I a CLOWN?! Do I AMUSE YOU?!
Ancient Elven secret, huh?
And Knowing is half the battle
And remember, when you touch yourself, the saints cry.
And there, on the door handle, was a HOOK!
And who can stop us ???
Animels vill be bred und SLAUGHTERED!
Are we there yet?
Are you known for your work in the theater?
Are you talking to me?
As you like it.
As you wish.
Ay oh- oh ay
Baby oil? Ahhhhnooooo!
Beware of the dwarf.
Big Money, Big Money, No whammies, STOP!
Bite me!
Bite me, Froto.
Boomy!
Boy, boy, crazy boy...
Bring out your dead.
But what does turning them into clowns prove John?
But you didn't tell me that I COULDN'T do that!
By this time my lungs were aching for air.
C'mon.I can use her in my act. Huzzah!
Care Bear Stare!!!
Complex problems have simple, easy to understand, wrong answers. 
Conform...conform...
Cowabunga!
Cut, it, out.
Damn you all to hell!
Dead people walking around get torched.
Dear gods, thank you so much for this scene!
Deliver your speech. I promise not to slay you until you have finished it.
Demonspawn, BEGONE!
Did I do that?
Did you ever wonder what black cats tasted like? * BURP *
Do not bring your evil here.
Do you find me pleasing? Do I please you?
Do you want to go faster?
Does this bug you? I'm not touching you.
Don't MISS!
Don't look at me! Don't you look at me! Mommy! MOMMY!
Don't worry, I have a plan...
Don't you do it!
Duh...I heard that!
Dumb as a bag of hammers.
Dying is easy, comedy is hard.
EAT HIM! HE'S BIGGER!
Emptiness feeds the hunger
Even without feet, I could kill you.
Every Time I Think I've Hit The Bottom, Somebody Throws Me A Shovel.
Everyone loves tar. Sure, who doesn't?
Evil doers beware!
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Faster, pussycat! Kill! Kill!
Feel The Power of The ultimate Warriorrrrrrrr!
Fifty Gold and time served
Freeze!
Game over!
Get off my laundry.
Get the clown hammer Mike.
Get these spiders off me!
Go ahead, make my day.
Go to bed, old man!
Good night and may Gods bless!
Groovy!
Ha ha ha ha! You're stuck here!
Ha! I kill me!
Have mercy
He is one weird mamma jamma.
He tampered in God's domain.
He's dead, Jim.
He's on the Jazz
Hello, Shoil!
Here comes the bride, she's out of her friggin' mind.
Here's the wind up, and the scream.
Hey Hay Hey
Hey Willie
Hey, Hey, Hey, What is going
Hey, I bet I can do that better than you can!
Hey, bug! Don't squeeze the shaman!!!
Hey, it's honey roasted.
Hey. I wanted that bone marrow.
Hi ho. Hi ho. It's off to death we go.
Hi-Keeba!
Hikeeba!
Ho Ho What!
Honey West!
Hope they landed on Yahoo serious.
How about a little fire?
How does this chair work?
How fortunate! This will simplify everything!
How much damage does a flaming thief do?
How much longer Papa?
How rude!
How would you like it if we picked YOUR apples?
Hurts, don't it? Tell your friends.
Hush, child, you'll anger the overlords.
Huzzah my butt!
Huzzah!
I Get No Respect
I WILL kill him!
I am not an animal! I am a human being!
I am outta here!
I am the god of hellfire and I bring you...
I can't come back, folks! I don't know how it works! Goodbye!
I didn't mean to hit you with that web spell. Let me help I'll BURN it off!
I don't have any solution, but I certainly admire the problem. 
I don't know what it was, but it sure hurt like hell...
I don't know!
I don't mind being stripped naked and thrown in the air if you think it will help.
I don't sit on your horse, so don't drive on my ass.
I don't understand!!
I don't want to die! I can't die. I have survival!
I got nowhere else to go!
I hate them because they kill my nice monsters. 
I hate when that happens
I have the power!!!
I hear you!
I just had one of my brilliant ideas
I know you are, but what am I?
I like you Brak. You have the gentle touch.
I like you--that's why I'm going to kill you last.
I love it when a plan comes together
I pity the fool!
I regret nothing!
I sing whenever I sing whenever I sing..
I smell a rat.
I suppose I'll knock him out with a rock, only... I'll use a soft rock, so it won't hurt that much.
I think I hear a giant sucking sound.
I want them dead!
I wet `em.
I wish those hands would push him over.
I wonder what this does ?
I'd hate to shoot a butt like that.
I'll be back.
I'll give you a definite maybe. 
I'll harm you!
I'll hit you so hard your dog will yelp.
I'll take this away so you don't hurt yourself.
I'm Larry. This is my brother, Darryl. This is my other brother, Darryl
I'm dead now. Please don't smoke.
I'm destined for greatness in *everybody's* lifetime!
I'm going to drink the hell about this Ale.
I'm going to give you such a pinch!
I'm going to go for violence, 'cause I know that works.
I'm huge!
I'm hysterical, and I'm wet, and I'm in pain!
I'm late for my ice dancing lesson.
I'm not dead yet!
I'm not dead yet.
I'm so sleepy I can barely keep my eyes open.
I'm the baby, gotta luv me.
I'm the god! I'M THE GOD!
I'm the misfit of the group, and I think they need me like a beauty pageant needs a Nosferatu.
If it jams, force it. If it breaks, it needed replacing anyway. 
If you cannot convince them, confuse them. 
If you don't understand it, it must be intuitively obvious. 
If you hit me and I find out about it...
If you think the problem is bad now, just wait until we've solved it. 
Inside every small problem is a large problem struggling to get out. 
Interesting--but STUPID!
Ironically, he collapses into an armchair.
Is it safe?
Is there something i should do, is there something i should say, or should i walk away?
It is easier to get forgiveness than permission. 
It stinks!
It wasn't me!
It's a mad house! A mad house!
It's fun.
It's hot and it hurts and stuff.
It's kind of fun to do the impossible. 
It's my way or the highway.
It's not whether you win or lose, it's how many rules you can personally make up during play.
It's show time synergy
It's the 'be there when we can' guards.
It's...
Join us!
Just shakin' the bushes, boss.
KISS MY GRITS!
Knew your father I did.
Know what I mean?
Let us be gay, for he is an idiot.
Let's Be Careful out there
Let's go do some crimes.
Let's kick into Grand Funk Medly!
Let's ride.
Life is simple here.
Like father, like son. Think about it, won't you?
Like; Whatever.
Little buddy!
Live, dammit, live! You've never given up on anything in your life, now LIVE!"
Logic is a systematic method of coming to the wrong conclusion with confidence. 
Look into your heart!
Manure dust overtakes the sleigh!
Maybe, Maybe Not!
Mm-HMMMMmmmm, that's good weed!
My experience shows that 95% of all humans are morons.
My mother was a saint!
My name is ________. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
NOW IS THE HOUR OF YOUR DEATH! ...more or less.
Nanoo Nanoo
Nice touch
No Problem!
No, you go first.
Norm!
Not gonna do it!
Not the Mama!
Not the clown suit!
Nothing Comes Between Me And My Britches
Now it's garbage.
Now we do the dance of Joy!
Now what were the words to that spell?
Now what, Boss?
OOGA BOOGA BOOGA!
Of course I do, don be reedeeculous
Oh don't tease us, put your legs up.
Oh great. We are saved by the gates of Hell.
Oh my lord!!
Oh no, they're on to us. Quick! Get the fireball!
Oh where you talking to me?
Oh, for fun!
Oh, just do it; and don't screw it up this time!
Oh, may I?
Oh, suddenly *I'm* the jerk!
Oh, that! Nope, never saw it."
Oh, the humanity...
Oh, the pain, the pain...
Ohhhh, lady!
Once I thought I was wrong, but I was mistaken.
Ooooh yeah, DIG IT!!!
Oooops !!
Oops, sorry! That was me...
Oui, I sure did that thing.
Pain is the healing.
Pray your gods who ask you for you blood. For they are ruthless punishers. 
Pull my finger!
Punky Power!
Put your shoes on, we're at grandma's.
Read My Lips.
Reality is what refuses to go away when I stop believing in it. 
Right now I'm having amnesia and deja vu at the same time. I think I've forgotten this before. 
SLEEP!
STAY!!!!!!
Saaaaaaay!
Sample my fist you community theater reject!
Sanctuary!
Seeing that the criminal justice system was not defending my rights, I released myself into my own custody.
Some thing is wrong...
Sometimes it's so easy, I'm ashamed of myself
Sometimes the more you wonder why, the worse it seems to get.
Speedy to the rescue!
Spoon!
Stay alive, no matter what occurs. I will find you!
Stay off the moors.
Stop or my heart will explode!
Stop this crazy thing!
Suit up and Roll Out!
Survey Says!
Sword of Omens, give me sight beyond sight!
Take off you hoser!
Terribly sorry, but my genitals have just absorbed a substantial amount of kinetic energy, and I am momentarily incapable of responding to any inquiries.
Thank you very much
Thank you, I'll be here all week. Enjoy the buffet!
Thank you, sir, may I have another?
That's what I'm asking. I don't know!
The Truth is only what you want to hear, there's no one left to fool but myself.
The horror! The horror!
The master wouldn't approve...
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the DUMB! 
There is no problem so difficult that it cannot be solved by brute strength and ignorance. 
There is no time like the present for postponing what we ought to be doing. 
There's a black greasy smudge on my pillow.
There's a dark oily spot on my headband.
They took my thumbs!
They wouldn't know subtlety if it painted itself purple and jumped up and down in front of them singing 'Subtlety is here again'...
They're greeeeeat!
This door sounds brown.
This is gonna be my new Saturday night thing.
This square bugs me! He really bugs me!
This was no boating accident.
Throw me the whip! Throw me the idol!
Thunder, thunder, thunder . . . HO!!!
Time for go to bed.
Toss the halfling in.
Trumpy, you can do stupid things!
Trust Me
Trust Me, I know what I'm doing
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Two Platinum! That's thirty Gold!
Underdark. I can't believe I'm still in the Underdark.
Up, Swift-Wind!
Wait a minute! You never said there was a monster here!
Wait! I'm a MASTER at unarmed combat!
Want some help?
Warriors, come out and play!
Watch out for snakes!
Water: the source of all life.
We may rise and Fall but in the end, we meet our fate together.
We need a distraction!
We'll be right down...down...
We're gonna get a bigger boat, right?
We're having an adventure!
We're making progress. Things are getting worse at a slower rate. 
Well, isn't that Special?!
What You Talkin' 'Bout?
What could possibly harm the greatest swordsman time has ever seen?
What if they bag the evil?
What is it about the gates of Hell that compels people to walk through them?
What manner of men are you who can summon fire without flint or tinder?
What's that, boy? Daddy's hurt? Down in the canyon?
When a leather-mug salesman dies...
When do I get to make things go BOOOOOMM?
When you're a _____, you're a _____ all the way, man!
Where does the school board find them?
Where gonna need another Timmy.
Where's the Beef
Who Ya Gonna Call?
Who's the new girl?
Whose woods these are, I think I know...
Why are we here? We're here to loot and pillage!
Wonder Powers Activate!
Works every time.
Works for me
Would you like it regular or extra crispy?
Wow. They held the tension for a full second.
Wrestling practice!
Yeah... That's the ticket
Yee Haw
Yo Joe! Hit em high and hit em low!
Yo, Mall-o-ry!
Yoo hoo, mister golem! i'm cute don't hurt us!
You Look Mahvelous
You better not try to play any tricks on me, I've been fooled before!
You big dummy
You can't handle the truth!
You did it! You finally did it!
You go; I'm bitter.
You got it dude
You have a nasty habit of surviving.
You have been weighed, measured and found wanting.
You have got to be kidding me!
You haven't seen the last of me.
You will bow down before me!
You'd better watch out! My FIVE POWERFUL FRIENDS will be coming through THAT DOOR any minute now!
You're all evil and I hope you all have snacks!
You're an Idiot Starscream!
You're gonna make it after all...
You're in big trouble mister"
You're living in fear of living and that's the way it goes.
You're lucky my chick's here.
You're ruining it for me.
You're soaking in it!
You've broken Orc law.
You... are going... to die! Because I... am going... to KILL you!
