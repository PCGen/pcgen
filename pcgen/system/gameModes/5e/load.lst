#LIFTING AND CARRYING
#Your Strength score determines the amount of weight
#you can bear. The following terms define what you can
#lift or carry.
#Carrying Capacity. Vour carrying capacity is your
#Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in
#pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that
#most characlers don't usually have to worry about it.
#Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a
#weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity
#(or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or
#dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity,
#your speed drops to 5 feet.
#Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more
#weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For
#each size category above Medium, double the creature's
#carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or
#lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
