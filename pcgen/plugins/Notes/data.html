      processor'. By clicking on a node in the tree, it load that subject into 
      the word processor to be read or edited. You can create new nodes by 
      using the New Node (<img src="stock_new-16.png">) button above. This

      <font size="3">The notes system is intended to organize not only your 
      notes, but your gaming files as well. You can drag and drop files into 
      the word processing window, and it will create an icon for it at the 
      bottom. This icon can be double clicked to launch the file in the 
      appropriate application. You can also drag and drop files on any node in 
      the tree, and it will store thie file inside that node, instead of the 
      active node (the one who's word processor is active).</font>
