/**
 * A TypeSafeConstant is an object which will provide a unique integer
 * identifier to every instance of that class (not unique to every
 * TypeSafeConstant).
 * 
 * As an example, If Classes A and B both extend TypeSafeConstant, then there
 * may be an instance of Class A that has ordinal 1 and an instance of Class B
 * that has ordinal 1, but only one instance of each class may have any ordinal.
 * (Two instances of Class A may not share ordinal 1 and still respect the
 * TypeSafeConstant interface)
 * 
 * This emulates behavior by the enum system in Java 1.5+. Note that the
 * identifier should be unique per virtual machine; thus serialization and other
 * forms of persistence of classes must ensure the uniqueness of identifiers of
 * a TypeSafeConstant.
 * 
 * It is considered good behavior for a TypeSafeConstant to begin the ordinal
 * count at zero. There may be an expectation by classes that use
 * TypeSafeConstants that expect this behavior. In that case, such behavioral
 * limitations should be documented in the TypeSafeConstant-using class.
