/**
 * An AbstractQualifiedListFacet is a DataFacet that contains information about
 * QualifyingObjects that are contained in a PlayerCharacter when a
 * PlayerCharacter may have more than one of that type of QualifyingObject (e.g.
 * Language, PCTemplate), the source of that object should be tracked, and the
 * PlayerCharacter can qualify for the object (they have prerequisites)
 * 
 * This class is designed to assume that each QualifyingObject may only be
 * contained one time by the PlayerCharacter, even if received from multiple
 * sources. The QualifyingObject will only trigger one DATA_ADDED event (when
 * added by the first source) and if removed by some sources, will only trigger
 * one DATA_REMOVED event (when it is removed by the last remaining source).
 * Sources do not need to be removed in the order in which they are added, and
 * the first source to be added does not possess special status with respect to
 * triggering a DATA_REMOVED event (it will only trigger removal if it was the
 * last source when removed)
 * 
 * The sources stored in this AbstractQualifiedListFacet are stored as a List,
 * meaning the list of sources may contain the same source multiple times. If
 * so, each call to remove will only remove that source one time from the list
 * of sources.
 * 
 * In general, QualifyingObjects that are stored in an
 * AbstractQualifiedListFacet are those where the Prerequisites are those that
 * are considered requirements. This means that as the Player Character changes,
 * the state of the Prerequisite can change and alter whether the underlying
 * object is granted to the Player Character. For PCGen 5.16, this will mean
 * things like the Prerequisite on the end of an ABILITY token (which are
 * continuously evaluated) not the PRExxx: tokens that appear directly on the
 * line of an Ability in the Ability LST file (those are evaluated only once,
 * when the Ability is first added to the Player Character)
 * 
 * null is a valid source but a valid item to be added to the list of objects
 * stored by AbstractQualifiedListFacet.
