Aura of Sobs	KEY:Aura of Sobs ~ Attic Whisperer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura								DESC:All the voices an attic whisperer steals linger around it in an invisible but audible aura of unnerving - often child-like - whimpers, limericks, songs, and sobs. This aura surrounds an attic whisperer in a 10-foot radius. Any sentient living creature that enters this area loses the benefit of any bardic performance ability and takes a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saving throws. An attic whisperer can suppress or reactive its aura as a free action.																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.92	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(10 ft.)

A fatigued creature affected by this attack becomes exhausted for 1 hour, while an exhausted creature falls unconscious for 1 hour.

During that time, the creature cannot talk, cast spells with verbal components, or use any other skill or ability that requires speech. This ability has no effect on creatures incapable of speech. Once an attic whisperer has stolen a creature's voice it can perfectly mimic that voice (or any other it has previously stolen) at any time, even after its victim's voice has returned. While mimicking a voice, the attic whisper can speak in any language the voice's owner knew, regardless of its prior knowledge of the language. Those familiar with an individual's voice can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the attic whisperer's Bluff check to realize a mimicked voice is inauthentic.|AtticWhispererStealVoiceDC	BONUS:VAR|AtticWhispererStealVoiceDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.92
