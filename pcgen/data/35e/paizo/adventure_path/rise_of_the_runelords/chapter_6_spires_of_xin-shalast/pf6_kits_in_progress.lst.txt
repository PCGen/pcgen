Speci al Abilities
Exceptional Stats (Ex) Karzoug was destined from birth to become
one of the greatest wizards of his age. As a result, his ability scores
were generated using 32 points, rather than the standard 25-point
elite array. Additionally, he has much more gear than standard for an
NPC of his level. These modifications increase his total CR by 1.
Immortal Secrets from ancient Thassilon and realms beyond have
allowed Karzoug to sustain his life indefinitely. Unless slain by
violent means, he is effectively immortal.
Inherent Bonuses Karzoug has used wish spells to increase his stats.
He has a +5 inherent bonus to his Intelligence and a +4 inherent
bonus to his other five ability scores.
Contingency If Karzoug ever becomes affected by a hostile spell
effect that prevents him from acting on his own, a greater dispel
magic targets him.
Permanent Spells Karzoug has made the following spells permanent
on himself: arcane sight, darkvision, see invisibility, and tongues.
Rune of Contingency This magic rune, created by Karzoug's Inscribe
Rune feat, allows Karzoug to gain the effects of feather fall and
water breathing once each per day. In addition, if he’s reduced to 0
or fewer hit points but is not killed, he turns into a cloud of vapor
as per the spell gaseous form for 5 rounds. He remains conscious
during this time, but after 5 rounds he returns to his normal form
and is unconscious and dying.
