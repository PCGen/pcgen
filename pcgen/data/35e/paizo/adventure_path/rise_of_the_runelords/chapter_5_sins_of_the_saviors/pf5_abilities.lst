Mark of Wrath	KEY:RotR ~ Mark of Wrath	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	SPELLS:Magic Item|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=15|Fire Shield,14	DESC:You have slain the latest Highlord of Wrath. This makes you the new Highlord and you now wear the mark of wrath - a faintly glowing tattoo-like rune on your forehead that moves through the generations from one ruler to the next. The mark of wrath provides you with a +1 insight bonus to AC and on attack and damage rolls. Once per day as a swift action, you can call upon the mark to protect you with a fire shield (CL 15th). If you are slain in combat, the mark of wrath transfers to the brow of your defeater. It can only be transferred again on that character's death at the hands of another, but can be removed with a successful break enchantment against CL 20th. Once removed in this manner, it vanishes forever.
