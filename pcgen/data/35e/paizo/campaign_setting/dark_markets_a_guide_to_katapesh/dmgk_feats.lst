Once per day, when one of your allies makes a saving throw, you may roll the same saving throw as if you were the one subject to the effect requiring it. You may use this ability after your ally has rolled, but before the GM declares if their roll was a success or failure. Your ally may choose to use your saving throw in place of his own.

SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:Your pesh-addled mind is difficult to influence. You gain a +2 bonus to Will saves if you have used pesh in the past hour. If you fail a saving throw against an enchantment effect while you are under the effects of pesh, you can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC; this feat only gives you one extra chance to succeed on the saving throw.

SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:When you are close to death, your body can convert pesh into lifesaving medicine. If you have used raw pesh or refined pesh in the past hour, and you are brought to 0 or fewer hit points, you may immediately gain 10 temporary hit points as a swift action. You may use this ability even if you are unconscious, but it cannot save you from an attack that immediately kills you. Using this ability makes you sickened for 24 hours. You can end the sickness by using raw pesh or refined pesh. Using this ability while you are sickened makes you exhausted. You can end the exhaustion by using pesh or refined pesh; this leaves you only sickened, and another dose can end the sickness.
