DESC:The bustling bazaars of Absalom offer countless delights, but even they do not sell everything. Only in the peerless markets of mysterious Katapesh can one find anything for sale, from the lost diamonds of a fallen empire to a clutch of slaves freshly captured off the Inner Sea coast. This exotic desert locale serves as the backdrop of the Pathfinder Adventure Path Legacy of Fire, and this informative, lushly illustrated full-color 64-page guide presents everything players and Game Masters need to know to bring the dark markets of Katapesh to terrible life.
