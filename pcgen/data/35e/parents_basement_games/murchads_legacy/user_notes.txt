Feats

The Background and Cultural Feats can only be selected at the time of
character creation so remember to make any selections of these at first
level as you will be unable to apply them at higher levels.

Underworld - The bonuses provided by this feat are situational and
depend on the PC being within the city of his chosing, the bonuses can
be appied in the Temporary Bonus Sub-Tab of the Inventory Tab

The Reward Feats are meant to be awarded by the game master and have
high in-game prerequisites, however since the prerequisites are not
based on mechanics they are selectable by any character within PCGen.
The text of the prerequisites appear in the feat info window and they
should not be taken without the game masters permission.

Classes

Imperial Legionnaire

The bonus hit points from the Aid Soul (Su) ability can be applied in
the temporary bonus tab. The Reflex bonus from True Awareness (ex) and
the AC bonus from Enhanced Defense are also applied through a temporary
bonus.

Steel Dragons

The bonus feats Steel Dragons get must be applied to a gun or gunpowder,
PCGen cannot enforce this so it is up to the user to follow the rules.
At any rate the are no guns in this set at this time so this is a bit of
a delema.

Shadowtamer

The Shadow Beast is set up as a companion modifier similar to a
familiar. In the Inventory/Resources Tab select an appropreate 2 HD or
less animal and apply it to the Shadow Beast.
