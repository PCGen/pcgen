DESC:They say it's good to be the king. Tell that to King Almagaid of Launhym. Tattooed orcs invading from the north, dwarves in the neighboring mountains lamenting their failed "gunpowder" weapons, a vast empire to the south, wealthy elitists taking control from the east, druids and clerics fighting internally, barons threatening to tear the country up, your wife of over twenty years may just well be having an affair, and all because some wizard named Murchad didn't get his way. Murchad's Legacy is a campaign setting in the "knights and castles" tradition using the d20 ruleset where the story slowly advances with every level up and the players drive the plot. All text is considered open gaming content and we welcome additions to this setting that was nominated in 2005 for an ENnie award.
