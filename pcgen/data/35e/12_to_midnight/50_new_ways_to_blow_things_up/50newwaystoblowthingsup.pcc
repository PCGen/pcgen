DESC:Fifty New Ways to Blow Things Up: Starlanko the Magnificent's Big Book of Evocations is the first in the series of spellbooks penned by none other than the world's most popular wizard, Starlanko the Magnificent. Each spell has been painstakingly examined to ensure that it lives up to the high standards that Starlanko the Magnificent establishes for himself. No "purple fireballs" here; we provide only the latest and greatest in original spell creations. Every level of spell is represented from the zero level pointer to the ninth level vorpal disk. Fifty New Ways to Blow Things Up is so full of evocational goodness that it is a book any wizard (or sorcerer) is bound to love. But wait, there's more. Fifty New Ways to Blow Things Up: Evocation also includes useful tactics and advice for each of the spells presented in the book, penned by none other than Starlanko the Magnificent himself. Also included is a heartbreaking introduction, a soul moving spell list, an appendix containing one (1) feat, a complete list of incantations in common and draconic, and a pricing guide for selling Fifty New Ways to Blow Things Up: Evocation in your game.
