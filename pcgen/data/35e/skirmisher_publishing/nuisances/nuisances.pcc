DESC:Nuisances is unlike any other fantasy RPG sourcebook! It is a tribute to the early years of fantasy roleplaying games, a parody of the current state of the genre, a manual for keeping cocky and annoying players off balance, and a poignant philosophical expression of the post-modern, 21st century worldview. This funny and irreverent book has quickly became Skirmisher Publishing's most popular title - and now it's even better! Nuisances: Director's Cut is a parody of fantasy roleplaying games, a tribute to them, and a guide for an alternate (and more fun) style of play. This bigger, longer, and uncut version of the original Nuisances has been re-edited, expanded from 96 to 130 pages, and includes more of what you loved in the first edition.
