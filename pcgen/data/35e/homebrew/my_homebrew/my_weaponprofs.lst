#####1st Example

#Dagger				TYPE:Simple

#####
#Dagger is the name of the weapon proficiency. This needs to be the same text that appears in the weapon's PROFICIENCY tag.
#The TYPE tag defines what type of weapon proficiency group the weapon belongs to.
#
#
#####2nd Example

#Greataxe				TYPE:Martial	HANDS:2

#####
#This example has an additional tag HANDS. HANDS:2 means that it must be wielded with 2 hands. Other than the name and the
#TYPE, the HANDS tag is not mandatory for a weapon proficiency. It can be used when necessary.
