#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Deities File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the deitis file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#####
#The first field is the Deity Name, this is a required field and does not have a tag.
#
#The DOMAINS tag is a list of domains that the deity grants to it's divine spell casting followings. The domain name MUST
#match the domain names listed in the domain list file.
#To limit alignments allowed for classes (such as cleric) to gain domains, use PREALIGN on the DOMAINS tag.
#
#The DESC tag is used for a quick description of the deity.
#
#The SYMBOL tag is used on the output sheet to display what the holy symbol is for this deity.
#
#The DEITYWEAP is holding a list of the deity's favored weapon(s). The Weapon name MUST match exactly what is listed in the
#weapon proficiencies list file.
#
#The ALIGN tag holds the two letter abbreviated alignment of the deity itself.
#
#The PANTHEON tag is used to specify what pantheon the deity belongs to.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the deity. This will be displayed in PCGen.
