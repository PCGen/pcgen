#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.

#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Skill File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the skills file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#Sleight of Hand is the name of the skill. It will appear in the skills list on PCGen's Skills tab and will be used if a
#skill gets bonused or is declared a class skill. It must be the first entry on each line.
#
#The KEYSTAT tag sets what stat the skill draw any bonuses from. If the tag is left off, no Stat bonus will be automatically
#applied.
#
#The USEUNTRAINED tag indicates if this skill can be used untrained by the character. It can be left off if it is set to YES.
#
#The ACHECK tag applies the Armor check penalty to this skill. It can be left off if it is set to NO.
#
#BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The PRESKILL tag is used with the BONUS tag, so it is required that you have a certain skill at a certain level to benefit
#from this Bonus. There is a multitude of existing prerequiste tags in PCGen. If you are looking into the documentation under
#List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "PRExxx tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the spell. This will be displayed in PCGen.
