#################################

# Common Charms
###COMMENT: Should I set these up as "Charm (Item)" and the Later Items "Talisman (Item)" or just use OUTPUTNAME?
###COMMENT: These are Slotless items - Charms and Talismans. You can wear two cloaks, two shirts, etc.
Alchemist's Flask																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When whatever's in this flask is gently heated for a few minutes it fractionates into layers which can be poured off individually. It can thus swiftly purify things, extract small amounts of essential oils, obtain samples of toxins, and so on.
All-weather Cloak																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Cool or warm as required, these cloaks repel water and stains as well, greatly reducing the effects of weather and exposure. Many people use them as blankets at night.
Amulet of the Stallion																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Enhances male potency. No details will be provided. A fairly rare charm, since it's so saleable that the formula is usually kept secret.
Animated Implement																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These include brooms, brushes, self-lighting lamps, small instruments or "music boxes", needles which automatically darn your clothes, and many similar charms. All of them are basically variants on Unseen Servant, and perform competently as far as their specifically programmed tasks go. Such items are mostly toys and status symbols.
Astrolabe																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This large pocket watch keeps track of the minutes, hours, days, months, years, the phases of the moon, the time of sunrise and sunset, dominant constellations, eclipses, and many other astronomical events. It provides a +5 bonus on relevant checks. Making these requires a lot of skill in mechanics in addition to the magical attunements that keep the whole thing operating correctly.
Automatic Writer																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When kept with a stack of paper, papyrus, or vellum these pens will competently take notes and sketch as directed, allowing the user to keep her hands free while still keeping a record or map.
Bardic Instruments (Charm)											OUTPUTNAME:Bardic Instruments, Charm									TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans	BONUS:SKILL|TYPE.Perform|4												BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These supply a +4 bonus on the user's performance skill, thanks to their exceptional tone. They also "contain" up to a dozen ballads; the user gains a +10 bonus when performing one of them.
Blemish Cream																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.190	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Neatly and painlessly removes minor skin blemishes - scars, acne, unwanted tattoos and so on. A pot normally suffices for 2d4 applications, but removing whole-body tattoos and such can reduce this.
Blessed Blades																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.190	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1	BONUS:WEAPONPROF=TYPE.Blades|TOHIT|1|TYPE=Sacred	SPROP:Imbued with positive energy, these weapons gain a +1 sacred bonus to hit and damage. A hit on an undead creature or evil outsider of more than 6 HD will overload and destroy them - but the energy released from the weapon will do an extra 10D4 damage to the creature struck in the process. Sadly - since charms are linked to their wielders - the wielder will be exposed to such an opponent's powers (typically an undead's touch attack or an outsider's corruption) at the same time. They are potent, but risky, weapons in a demon-hunter's arsenal, as they're good-aligned. These are also very rare, since it takes a fairly powerful, and very skillful, priest-smith to make them. In most cases, they have to be discovered.
Blessed Symbol																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.190	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These work like - or essentially are - "Holy Water", and can be used like it three times per day. This usually involves throwing the symbol or holding it against the enemy.
Bracers of Force																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.190	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These brass wristbands allow the user to create and shape minor "force fields" in a five foot radius. These are capable of withstanding up to one point of damage and work well at warding off rain and wind, keeping bugs off, blocking smoke and gas, and holding hot items. They can't support weights of more than ten pounds or so though.
Brick Press																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.190	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This simple machine turns ordinary mud brick into "fired" brick with a minute or two of squeezing. It's handy, if a bit slow, for any builder.
Captain's Torc (Charm)												OUTPUTNAME:Captain's Torc, [NAME]										TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.190	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans	BONUS:SKILL|Listen|4													BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This neckpiece amplifies sound and thus provides both a +4 bonus to Listen checks and great volume to the user's voice, allowing him or her to be clearly heard at considerably greater distances. They do, however, have the unfortunate side effect of a -1 on saving throws versus sonic attacks. They're fairly popular with orators, actors and, of course, military commanders.
Chel'ian																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These compass-like devices point towards something in particular - a fragment of which must be incorporated in them when they're made.
Cleansing Wand																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This simple charm cleans items and areas by being waved over them.
Condensed Water																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These small tablets expand into 5 gallons of water when crushed. There are usually 4d6 in a vial. The formula can be easily tweaked to produce oil, soup, porridge, and so on, but the creator must supply the material in the first place.
Conjurer's Tattoo (Charm)											OUTPUTNAME:Conjurer's Tattoo, [NAME]									TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This stylized image allows its user to spend HP to conjure up a specific item for an hour or so. Charms allow the user to produce things like short swords, lock picks, shields, coils of rope and so on, at a cost of 1D4 HP.
Contraceptive Charm																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Prevents pregnancy. Far more common than is normally admitted; they can be used by either of the parties involved.
Copy Paper																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When touched to something with writing or a picture on it, these sheets copy it. If bound as a book, they can copy other books. These usually come in packets of 50 sheets.
Dreamcatcher																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This keeps minor evil spirits and nightmares from bothering those who sleep nearby.
Deathwand																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These do kill things; given a few hours to work in they can eliminate infestations of insects or fungi, kill stubborn patches of weeds, and make mice or rats feel rather ill. The effect is "tuned" by the will of the user, but usually affects a modest area. They can be used up to three times per day.
Diplomatic Sash																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Creates illusory clothing. It can be used up to three times per day for one hour.
Ditty Bag (Charm)																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These contain bits of string, old pins, candle stubs, worn fishhooks, sinkers, bits of chalk, glue, sticky plaster, scraps of paper, and many other bits of random junk. Ditty Bags never weigh more than six ounces or so - but one can pull out any minor bit of gear that happens to be needed up to three times a day, provided that its value is less than 1 CP.
Dowsing Stick																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These can be used to find a clearly visualized object in the immediate vicinity - as well as for locating water underground. They can be used up to three times per day.
Dream Anchor (Charm)												OUTPUTNAME:Dream Anchor, [NAME]										TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This shadowy crystal acts as a focus and anchor for mental images; Using it, you can build up and detail an image in your mind over days, weeks, or years - to the point of depicting each drop of dew on every leaf of a mighty garden. Anyone who holds an activated Dream Anchor can immerse themselves in the full-sensory vision stored within. They can be dangerously addictive or lead to madness - but they are also useful methods of preserving memories and lore. A minor illusion spell will allow those in the area to share the vision - allowing a mage to use one as the core of a powerful, intricate, and long-term illusion.
Dream Essence																												TYPE:Charm.Drug																									SOURCEPAGE:p.191	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This is a highly addictive drug, inducing a variety of wonderful dreams and ecstatic pleasures while gradually eroding the user's will. DC 14 will save to avoid addiction when exposed. Addicts take 1 negative level (this cannot result in level loss and remains until the addiction ends) and lose one point of Wisdom per month, to a maximum of -8, and a minimum score of 1. They tend to become docile and easily manipulated. A vial of dream essence typically contains a month's supply. Breaking the addiction requires seven successful saves - after which the addict will slowly recover. Taking a dose, however, will start things all over again.
Druid Boxes																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Any small plants put into these modest glass-covered pots or boxes will grow and flourish, regrowing picked leaves and similar minor damages overnight. A set holds a dozen small plants.
Dust of Illusion ~ TPE												OUTPUTNAME:Dust of Illusion											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This dust produces minor visual illusions; small light shows, hiding a door, casting images on a surface, altering the color and style of clothing and so on. A typical "batch" contains 4d6 pinches, each good for 1d4 hours.
Elfin Cloak																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans	BONUS:SKILL|Hide|4													BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Chameleon-like, these "blend in" with their background. This provides a +4 bonus to Hide, +7 if you're standing still or are hiding in a forest or other natural environment - and +10 if both apply. These are rather suspicious items in most people's eyes, however traditional they may be.
Elfin Rope (150 ft)												OUTPUTNAME:Elfin Rope, [NAME]											TYPE:Charm									WT:4																	SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans	BONUS:SKILL|Use Rope|4													BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This splendid rope has 8 HP, is DC 28 to break, and provides a +4 bonus on Use Rope, mostly because it never slips or comes unknotted when the user doesn't want it to, and does so when lightly shaken if he / she does. It also coils neatly and never tangles. The standard 150 Ft coil weighs 4 Lb.
Elfinstone																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This amulet works as a skill-12 healer (roll independently of any other healer on the spot), when dealing with problems of fertility, pregnancy or childbirth.
Endless Stick																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This puzzling collection of sticks, rings, beads, and leather strips, keeps infants happily and safely occupied for hours on end.
Endless String																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This ball of string never seems to run out, supplying several hundred feet per day.
Enscrolled Gameboard																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This chess/checker/ backgammon/whatever board plays a creditable (skill bonus of +5), but not brilliant, game.
Filing Cabinet																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Books and/or papers tossed into this chest/set of shelves will be neatly classified, filed and indexed automatically.
Firebox																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:While always cool on the outside, opening this small metal box reveals a small perpetual fire - suitable for small-scale cooking, heating tents, etc. It does not smoke. Smaller-scale versions are usually used as firelighters.
Firespice Shakers																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The peppery spices dispensed by this shaker add flavor - and actual heat - to any dish.
Fireworks Pouch																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This small pouch allows the user to produce up to (Dex) small fireworks - flash and smoke pellets, small rockets, flares - per day. While basically harmless illusions, these are bright, noisy and spectacular.
Flame Snuffer																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This small wand puts out one modest flame (lantern, candle, match) within sixty feet with a quick gesture and a whispered phrase.
Folding Chair																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This small packet easily unfolds to form a comfortable reclining lounge chair. Expensive versions are embroidered and decorated.
Foothold Boots																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These boots can create a momentary disk of force under themselves three times per hour - allowing the user to briefly find purchase in midair, and so cross narrow chasms and rivers, avoid falls, and perform unlikely midair acrobatics.
Flux Iron																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This alloy reshapes itself according to its wielder's will - allowing it to substitute for a wide variety of tools and simple weapons.
Foulflesh Amulet																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This simple leaden charm imparts a terrible flavor to whatever tissue it touches for a few hours. While the effect wears off in a day or so, it's sometimes used to sabotage meals - or, far more practically, to ward off insects and predators (a DC 15+ will save is required for each bite after the first).
Fountain Tube																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.192	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These bronze pipes induce water, or any other fluid, to flow uphill through them. Should it matter, they have a capacity of 1 gallon-foot/round (e.g; Flow Rate = 1 Gallon/Number of Feet raised per round).
Glimmerdust																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This dust sparks and glows when touched by focused magic. Those skilled in spellcraft can get a fair idea of the nature and power levels of the magic involved by examining the resulting lightshow. A bag of glimmerdust usually contains 50 pinches.
Glittering Disc																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These simple crystal pendants can be used to cast a Hypnotism spell when swung up to 3 times per day. They won't work in combat situations.
Grace of Miravor																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Prevents most illnesses. Most notably, this includes arthritis, incontinence, and the various infirmities of age - if not aging penalties.
Great Horn																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When winded, this horn produces a fair imitation of the mating call - if any - of any single type of creature to be found within a mile.
Guidestones																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:A handful of intricately carved beads usually strung as a necklace or wristlet, Guidestones are imbued with a specific Knowledge: Local Area skill at level six. Given the rate at which cities change, these are usually only made by primitive tribes for a valued ally.
Heartrune																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Linked to a particular heart, this tiny charm pulses as long as that heart beats. The colors of the pulse show the condition of the individual it's attuned to, and it can be easily used as a link to that person. This does not count against the usual charm limit as long as it's in the possession of the "target's" mother or father.
Hidden Pocket (Charm)																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These warp space slightly, allowing them to hold about 2 pounds worth of gear without any noticeable weight - or bulk. The access point can be a mere slit, and is usually concealed in a sleeve, fold of cloth, belt, or similar location.
Ice Chest																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The inside of this chest is always very cold - and often has a smaller space that's cold enough to freeze water. They're most commonly used in fancy kitchens and alchemical labs.
Iconograph																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:A "camera" of sorts, which transfers a decent image to whatever surface (paper, glass, skin, etc) is slotted into it. It works up to twelve times per day.
Impervious Glue																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The glue from this vial takes one or two minutes to set, but is nearly impervious after that (Str DC 25 to break, likely to damage one of the surfaces involved). The makers usually include a vial of solvent - but this somehow always seems to run out a lot faster than the glue.
Journeybread																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Meals for a month in a 3-Lb bag. Flavor depends on the maker's cooking skill however.
Lens of Memory																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This crystalline charm can be used to recall a specific scene or brief period of the past in exacting detail up to 3 times per day.
Lightstone																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Carries a continuous Light effect. The brightness tends to vary depending on the user's level and emotional state.
Loaded Brush (Charm)																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These brushes are always loaded with just the right amount of ink, glue, or paint, for the user to work with and never dry out.
Local Guidebook																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This small book mystically provides "tourist information" about wherever you are at the moment, including simple sketch-maps of large cities, good spots to eat and drink, and any random information the game master wants to give out.
Locking Tarp																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This canvas sheet can be fastened in place by simply pinching its edge, allowing the user to set up a sunshade, tent, or hammock without having to bother with a framework to hold it up. It releases on the owner's command.
Lore Scroll																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These give their user basic (skill rank 4) competence in a given knowledge skill - although this is NOT cumulative with any actual skill the user has. The user must study it during the "attunement" period for this to work.
Lucky Charm																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These come in a variety of forms, but all work the same way; users tend to find life a bit easier and more convenient in general and may request a minor stroke of good fortune - a brief distraction, something handy to wedge a door with, finding a small clue, a root to catch, a grappling hook not slipping, etc - once per game session. The GM should reject any request which goes beyond a "bit of luck".
Luncheon Pot																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This small pot of cheese, butter, or jam refills itself every night, with enough spread to make several good sandwiches. While you can't live on this, it will nicely supplement a marginal diet.
Mage Tether																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This charm lets the user call for the animal whose hair was used to make it. If it's within two miles it will come as quickly as it reasonably can. As a side effect the user gets a +2 bonus on ride and handle animal rolls involving the animal in question.
Maiden's Hand																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When attached to a crank/wheel this bronze ring exerts a steady 5-lb push/pull; enough to slowly work a small water-screw, to grind flour for a small family, run a fan, or turn a roast.
Maker's Mill																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This simple charm can be applied to almost any single item of machinery; it will stop automatically when something jams, or if someone gets caught in the mechanism.
Mandarin's Pin																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This modest pin keeps the wearer and his clothing clean, neat, and well-mended.
Merasian Vapors (Charm)												OUTPUTNAME:Merasian Vapors, [NAME]										TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The vapors that pour out of these glass capsules perform a complete makeover - including growing, removing, or styling hair, partial or whole-body makeup jobs, perfuming, cleansing, and minor clothing alterations. Details are up to whoever's in the vapor. They usually come in a bag of 1d12+12 capsules and provide a "+5" bonus on disguise checks.
Merchant's Saddle																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These never slip on a mount and provide a +3 bonus to any rolls to avoid falling off.
Moodlamp																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The gently colored light emitted by this copper lamp will subtly influence the moods of anyone in the immediate area. While the effect is subtle, it can have a notable impact on the outcome of a lengthy meeting, dinner, or other social event.
Music Box																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Plays any of a dozen or so tunes or can be set to simply chime and tinkle prettily.
The Ocean's Arms																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These engraved shells make their user very buoyant, making it nearly impossible to drown while wearing one.
Origami Paper																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These small sheets of paper carry a tiny animation charm, and make amusing toys. They can be used to carry a small coin, a pinch of powder or a similar item. They come in packets of 50 sheets.
Peace Cord																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When tied around a weapon and/or sheathe this colorful string makes those items invisible when not in use.
Peacock Fan																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These folding paper fans float around after their user and provide a personalized cool breeze when it's hot, as well as waving away smoke, bugs and unpleasant odors.
Phantom Melody																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This jaunty, lilting, tune "sticks in your head", causing you to whistle and hum it at odd intervals. Oddly enough, this repels most minor fey - possibly because they simply don't want to catch it.
Phoenix Pillow																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The user sleeps so comfortably and soundly that he or she will be fully rested within six hours and may even tolerate up to 15 minutes worth of interruptions during that time without penalty.
Phylactery of Whispering Shadows																									TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This handy charm can be activated three times per day, and momentarily causes those within 10' to see and hear something "acceptable". If they're waiting for a password, they'll probably hear the user's unintelligible mutter as whatever's right. If they're waiting for cultists, they'll see the user as one of them. In game terms, this is a bluff check with a +10 bonus
Plush Golem																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Grants animation, speech, and limited friendly, helpful, sentience to a favored toy. Such "Golems" tend to be rather dimly sensible, or at least more so than most small children are.
Polishing Cloth																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These reduce the laborious task of cleaning and polishing stone, wood and metal to a few quick swipes. They're very popular among carpenters and stoneworkers.
Resounding Horn																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The sound of this horn carries an exceptionally long way and is easily recognized. If the user is desperate or expends 1D4 temporary Con points their family and any close companions will hear an echo of its sound wherever they may be in the world.
Ring of Mist																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This minor item can spray up to four "doses" of any liquid the user happens to be carrying onto any target within 20 Feet as a "+5" ranged touch attack. It may be used up to three times per day.
Runesign																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Whether painted or carved these luminous runes readily communicate their meaning to anyone who so much as glances at them - making them popular with shopkeepers and the erectors of public works. Making them flash on and off, or adding modest "animations", is optional.
Sands of Time																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This small hourglass holds a minute or so of subjective time. When called upon it will allow the group a brief time in which to converse and consider - although no physical actions may be taken. The Sands may be called upon three times a day. Even those on the verge of death may converse freely while the influence of the Sands holds.
Scrying Mirror																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.195	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These grant brief and fragmented clairvoyant visions when peered into. How long this takes, and whether persistence results in repetition or new visions, is up to the GM. While such visions are always accurate, they're often symbolic, or otherwise difficult to interpret.
Sculptor's Smoke																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.196	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When set alight these packets of powder produce a billowing cloud of smoke that can be shaped, and even animated, by the user's mind. Sadly for would-be illusionists, however, it's obviously only smoke. They're very handy for the "This is what we've got in mind" sort of display however. A batch usually fills 5-8 packets. For those who like animating smoke rings, it only takes a tiny pinch added to your pipe to do it.
Shadow Lantern																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.196	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This brass lamp allows the user to create intricate, detailed, shadow-pictures by moving his or her fingers in front of the lamp.
Shadow Vellum																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.196	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This sheaf of paper takes temporary imprints from the user's mind, allowing the user to employ the Forgery skill in seconds - rather than in the minutes or hours it normally requires.
Sealed Helm																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.196	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These hold a modest "bubble" of fresh air about the user's head when he is exposed to a hostile environment. Unfortunately, the helm cannot refresh the air, but it suffices for several minutes.
Seeing Crystal (Charm)												OUTPUTNAME:Seeing Crystal, [NAME]										TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.196	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These induce a deep trance and open the user's mind to visions. In general, roll a d10; 1-2, No Vision; 3-4, The vision comes from whatever source the character is most attuned to; 5, a Celestial Power; 6, an Infernal Power; 7-8, Elemental, Nature, or Fey powers; 9, Ancestor Spirits; 10, Incomprehensibly Alien Powers. In general, gaining a coherent vision requires a Will check, figuring out who, or what sent, it requires an Arcane or Religious Lore check, and actually figuring out what it means may require further lore checks and / or research - and even that may reveal only that such a vision is a deception. The use of seeing crystals has been responsible for great intelligence coups, as well as quite a few disasters. In general, no one may use a seeing crystal more than once or twice a day at best; the mental strain is just too great. Attempting to do so opens one to outright hypnotic manipulations by otherworldly powers.
Shearing Wand																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Sheers sheep neatly and very, very, quickly. Pranksters use them on things other than sheep.
Shuriken Pouch																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This small bag can store six user-provided magic missiles; the user may "pull out" and throw up to three of them per round. While not guaranteed to hit, this is a ranged touch attack with a +10 bonus and a range increment of 40 feet.
Sickstick																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These change color when they're touched to a creature who's ill; the color gives a rough idea of what's wrong while how far it spreads up the stick indicates how serious it is.
Silken Hammer																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This tool exerts no more force than the brush of a silken thread against any surface save its intended target. They're used in fine crafts, and by the occasional clumsy carpenter who wants to avoid smashing his or her fingers.
Silken Net																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This works like an ordinary combat net but has a range of 30 feet, 12 HP, and refolds itself - all in a coin-sized packet which weighs only an ounce or so.
Sleeping Powders (Tablets, Smoke, Oil)	KEY:Sleeping Substances																				TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:A powerful but slow-acting sophoric. It takes effect in (5 + Constitution Modifier) minutes; active characters, or those who resist, will suffer "Exhaustion", quiet characters fall asleep, and those who are already asleep become almost impossible to awaken.
Sovereign Ointment																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:A flask of this ointment holds about thirty doses - each equivalent to a "Cure Minor Wounds" spell. Sadly, it only works on recent wounds, and no single individual can benefit from more than 1D4 +1 applications in any one day. Getting the necessary herbs to make it is the hardest part; cruder versions tend to leave scars. People who think scars are impressive tend to prefer the cruder versions.
Sower's Glove																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Seeds scattered from this glove are imbued with resistance to fungus and blight, and grow rapidly and well.
Spectacles																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These minor devices eliminate personal penalties to spot checks, including those from things in your eyes.
Stone of Purity																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This simple carved stone purifies water as it passes around it. While this generally is not enough to neutralize serious poisons, it's enough to make ordinarily contaminated or polluted water safe and pleasant to drink.
Stunstone																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These amber beads stun small insects if they come within two feet of the wearer, thus keeping off flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, and similar pests.
Sunstone (Charm)																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These modest opals store sunlight, to be reemitted on command - illuminating a ten-foot radius with full daylight and dimly lighting the area for some distance beyond that. This is true sunlight, and so can deter a variety of undead and other mystical menaces. Unfortunately, while such stones absorb sunlight from an area about a foot across during the day, they emit it in a ten foot radius - and so will discharge an entire day's accumulation in about five minutes. A sunstone has a maximum capacity of 2D6+3 minutes, depending on the size and quality of the stone.
Swarm Bow																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This hand crossbow "fires" a small swarm of hornets as a ranged touch attack. The swarm has 6 HP against fire and area attacks, causes 1D3 damage per round if ignored (or 1 point if the victim spends the round resisting) and is a DC 16 distraction to spellcasting and concentration. The swarm pesters its victim for 3 rounds unless otherwise dispersed. A swarm bow can hold 2-8 charges. Unfortunately, recharging requires finding a hornet's nest and sucking the inhabitants thereof into the bow. This isn't fun.
Sweat Stone																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.198	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When used in a sweat lodge, the steam becomes truly purifying, equivalent, if given enough time to work in, to the care of a skill-8 healer.
Talespinner's Cloth																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.198	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Those who peer into the weave of this cloth will be able to see and hear the events a storyteller using it describes.
Tattooist's Pen																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.198	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These simple quills cause the ink on them to sink into virtually any surface.
Tinkerstone																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.198	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These cast a "Mending" cantrip when rubbed over a broken item up to three times per day. Minor variants with more specific attunements (Tailoring or Cobbling are common) can perform minor alterations and/or slightly larger repairs.
Totem Pole																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.198	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These can be made to either attract or repel some type of wildlife. They're most effective on smaller creatures. Common types include squirrels, birds, and "vermin" in general. They're commonly used to protect stored food, to draw birds to gardens, to keep bugs from eating your vegetables, and so on.
Trackless Boots																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.198	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The wearer does not leave a trail and cannot be tracked by nonmagical means. This does not, however, extend to mounts or companions.
Trainer's Amulet																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.198	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This lets domesticated animals understand what you want them to do while they wear it. It doesn't make them any smarter or guarantee obedience, but does provide a +5 bonus on relevant rolls.
Traveler's Bedroll																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This simple bedroll is always warm, dry, insect-free, and extremely comfortable. Its virtue permits the user to manage comfortably on only six hours of sleep a night.
Traveler's Pin																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This simple clasp grants the user a basic understanding of the language and the customs of a particular group, greatly reducing the chance of accidentally offending people.
Tribal Sigil																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This tattoo provides a "+4" bonus on Survival when the user is within the territory of the tribe in question and +2 when in a similar environment. It also marks the wearer as a tribal friend and ally.
Unicorn Goblet																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This ivory ornament - commonly set into a goblet - changes color when touched by poison.
Vanishing Cloak																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Casts a charm of momentary invisibility on whatever it's over up to [3+L/3] times per day. While the effect only lasts for a round or two, it's an excellent chance to disengage, or to duck out of sight.
Voicelock																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These simple locks wouldn't be that big a challenge for a locksmith, except for the fact that the keyhole only appears when a particular phrase set by the owner is whispered to the lock.
Walking Staff																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:The bearer will never become lost and - in addition - movement penalties for weather and/or difficult terrain are reduced by 5 feet/round.
Wand of Encryption																											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Normally made in matched sets, these wands can be programmed with up to three simple ciphers (Knowledge/Encryption at 25+ to break) or one more elaborate (30+) code when they're made - and can translate a short manuscript three times per day.
Warding Cartouche																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:When fixed to a small building this handy charm helps prevent whatever misfortune is inscribed upon it via an Unseen Servant. An antitheft Cartouche locks up and trips thieves, fire prevention snuffs small flames before they turn into larger ones and wakes people if necessary, housekeeping charms keep the place clean and neat (and incidentally far healthier), and so on. Minor variants can be attached to (small) boats to help steady, guide, and propel, them, but this is of limited effectiveness since they're neither all that strong nor clever.
Wardstone (Charm)													OUTPUTNAME:Wardstone, [NAME]											TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These enchanted gems provide resistance to a particular source of injury - typically about 1-3 points, depending on how specific the effect is. A wardstone might provide resistance-2 to fire, arrows, or slashing weapons, 1 versus weapons, 3 versus snake venoms (reducing normal or attribute damage) and so on. Almost uniquely, wardstones are cumulative; a wealthy character who fears a specific threat can gain a fair degree of protection against it.
Weave of Light																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These complex rings allow the user to create artistic displays of light and even simple, obvious, images in a 10 Ft radius pretty much at will. They're basically toys however, they can't fool anyone.
Weirdin																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This charm may be placed on cards, yarrow stalks, runestones, and other items, allowing them to be used for effective, if vague and limited, divination effects. Sadly, they're often difficult to interpret effectively. Thanks to this difficulty many priests advise against using them since: 1) They only tend to encourage guesswork and make you nervous, 2) You should trust in the Gods rather than try to peer into the future, and 3) A vague feeling that "It will get worse if you pick at it". Everyone uses them anyway, usually with the predicted problems.
Wellstone																													TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:Made from naturally-holed stones, these produce a steady trickle of fresh water, yielding 2d4 gallons per day.
Willow Powder																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.200	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This powder soothes illnesses, pain and fever, hangovers, etc, when stirred into water or wine and drunk. A packet normally contains enough for up to 50 doses.
Wizard's Hand																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.200	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:This jade scarab is equivalent to a standard "Hand of the Mage", although it takes just a bit more concentration to use.
Wraith Gauntlets																												TYPE:Charm																										SOURCEPAGE:p.200	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans																	BONUS:VAR|CharmCount|1										SPROP:These useful gloves can turn the user's hands momentarily intangible; allowing him/her to reach inside of things (to put things in - or pull them out), to turn doorknobs from the other side, hit incorporeal creatures, and so on. This is, however, a bit disruptive of the user's molecular structure; the user will take 1D4 damage each time they're used.


###Block: Common Talismans
# Equipment Name			Output Name						Type				Define				Source Page		Ability									Combat bonus						Bonus to skill			Modify VAR										Special Property
Bardic Instrument (Talisman)	OUTPUTNAME:Bardic Instrument, [NAME]	TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.189	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans									BONUS:SKILL|TYPE.Perform|4	BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These supply a +4 bonus on the user's performance skill, thanks to their exceptional tone. They also "contain" up to a dozen ballads; the user gains a +10 bonus when performing one of them.
Captain's Torc (Talisman)	OUTPUTNAME:Captain's Torc, [NAME]		TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.200	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This neckpiece amplifies sound and thus provides both a +4 bonus to Listen checks and great volume to the user's voice, allowing him or her to be clearly heard at considerably greater distances. They do, however, have the unfortunate side effect of a -1 on saving throws versus sonic attacks. They're fairly popular with orators, actors and, of course, military commanders. Talismanic versions allow their wearers to channel the sound of their voice to specific locations within 60 feet.
Ditty Bag (Talisman)		OUTPUTNAME:Ditty Bag, [NAME]			TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.200	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These contain bits of string, old pins, candle stubs, worn fishhooks, sinkers, bits of chalk, glue, sticky plaster, scraps of paper, and many other bits of random junk. Ditty Bags never weigh more than six ounces or so - but one can pull out any minor bit of gear that happens to be needed up to three times a day, provided that its value is less than 1 SP.
Dream Anchor (Talisman)		OUTPUTNAME:Dream Anchor, [NAME]		TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.200	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This shadowy crystal acts as a focus and anchor for mental images; Using it, you can build up and detail an image in your mind over days, weeks, or years - to the point of depicting each drop of dew on every leaf of a mighty garden. Anyone who holds an activated Dream Anchor can immerse themselves in the full-sensory vision stored within. They can be dangerously addictive or lead to madness - but they are also useful methods of preserving memories and lore. A minor illusion spell will allow those in the area to share the vision - allowing a mage to use one as the core of a powerful, intricate, and long-term illusion. -Talismanic Anchors are extremely dangerous; they can bestow a certain amount of shadow-reality on the visions within. It is easy to become lost in them - or to build up a shadow-creation beyond your direct control. Spellcasters can spend a week or so filling them with shadow, to be poured into a single, preset, image spell - and so grant it partial (40%%) reality.
Hidden Pocket (Talisman)	OUTPUTNAME:Hidden Pocket, [NAME]		TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.193	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These warp space slightly, allowing them to hold about 15 pounds worth of gear without any noticeable weight - or bulk. The access point can be a mere slit, and is usually concealed in a sleeve, fold of cloth, belt, or similar location.
Loaded Brush (Talisman)		OUTPUTNAME:Loaded Brush, [NAME]		TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These brushes are always loaded with just the right amount of ink, glue, or paint, for the user to work with and never dry out. Talismanic version can change colors and consistency as needed.
Merasian Vapors (Talisman)	OUTPUTNAME:Merasian Vapors, [NAME]		TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.194	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:The vapors that pour out of these glass capsules perform a complete makeover - including growing, removing, or styling hair, partial or whole-body makeup jobs, perfuming, cleansing, and minor clothing alterations. Details are up to whoever's in the vapor. They usually come in a bag of 1d12+12 capsules and provide a "+10" bonus on disguise checks. Talismanic versions can extensively alter clothes.
Seeing Crystal (Talisman)	OUTPUTNAME:Seeing Crystal, [NAME]		TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.196	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These induce a deep trance and open the user's mind to visions. In general, roll a d10; 1-2, No Vision; 3-4, The vision comes from whatever source the character is most attuned to; 5, a Celestial Power; 6, an Infernal Power; 7-8, Elemental, Nature, or Fey powers; 9, Ancestor Spirits; 10, Incomprehensibly Alien Powers. In general, gaining a coherent vision requires a Will check, figuring out who, or what sent, it requires an Arcane or Religious Lore check, and actually figuring out what it means may require further lore checks and / or research - and even that may reveal only that such a vision is a deception. The use of seeing crystals has been responsible for great intelligence coups, as well as quite a few disasters. In general, no one may use a seeing crystal more than once or twice a day at best; the mental strain is just too great. Attempting to do so opens one to outright hypnotic manipulations by otherworldly powers.  Talismanic versions allow simple clairvoyance, as well as visions from outside powers. The roll should still be made since, while purely clairvoyant visions are always accurate barring the use of major illusion magic, other powers may still direct your visions to particular items and locations. Such influences are far more subtle than a simple false vision, and are near-impossible to detect. Wise men usually recommend against the use of seeing crystals. The ambitious and arrogant use them anyway.
Sunstone (Talisman)		OUTPUTNAME:Sunstone, [NAME]			TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.197	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These modest opals store sunlight, to be reemitted on command - illuminating a ten-foot radius with full daylight and dimly lighting the area for some distance beyond that. This is true sunlight, and so can deter a variety of undead and other mystical menaces. Unfortunately, while such stones absorb sunlight from an area about a foot across during the day, they emit it in a ten foot radius - and so will discharge an entire day's accumulation in about five minutes. A sunstone has a maximum capacity of 4D6+6 minutes, depending on the size and quality of the stone. Can be made to emit ten minutes worth at once as a single ray of Searing Light (at CL5). Since this is stored natural sunlight spell resistance does not apply. Unfortunately, finding an opal of the size and quality required for a Sunstone Talisman is quite difficult.
Wardstones (Talisman)		OUTPUTNAME:Wardstones, [NAME]			TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.199	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These enchanted gems provide resistance to a particular source of injury - typically about 1-3 points, depending on how specific the effect is. A wardstone might provide resistance-2 to fire, arrows, or slashing weapons, 1 versus weapons, 3 versus snake venoms (reducing normal or attribute damage) and so on. Almost uniquely, wardstones are cumulative; a wealthy character who fears a specific threat can gain a fair degree of protection against it. Wardstones can only be crafted from fine gems - a limitation that drastically reduces their popularity. They're popular gifts from wealthy parents to younger - and more venturesome - offspring however. "Lifestones" protect against bleeding wounds. Users will not suffer continuing damage or constitution loss from "Wounding" weapons, or lose HP over time if below zero HP. Talismanic wardstones can provide an immediate extra saving throw against a particular effect or a type of energy. While they only function 2d4 times in a given week, they're still popular among X-slayers and other specialists who can afford them.
# Actual Listing:
Blazetongue											TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.200	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This tiny ruby imbues any weapon it's set on with the Flaming property. Unfortunately, each full minute of use in a 24-hour interval does a point of temporary Constitution damage to the user.
Blessed Relic										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This adds the effects of "Holy Water" to a Turn Undead attempt up to (3+L/3) times per day.
Bracers of Hurling									TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These permit the user to throw small items with the speed, and effective range, of a light crossbow.
Conjurer's Tattoo										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This stylized image allows its user to spend HP to conjure up a specific item for an hour or so. Talismans can produce things like suits of armor, small obedient animals, and crossbows, for 2D4 HP.
Dao Sigil											TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This amulet enhances natural healing; the wearer recovers an extra D6 HP and temporary attribute point per day. Given months (or years) it will even regenerate lost limbs and organs.
Earth-Blessed Plow									TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This makes it much easier and quicker to plow fields.
Endless Rope										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This coil of rope never seems to run out, supplying several hundred feet per day.
Fiend Gauntlets										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:Made from tanned demonhide, these gloves bestow the basic qualities of demon skin on the user's hands, allowing him to handle corrosive, hot, and otherwise nasty things without fear of harm.
Glasscraft Gloves										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These let the user hold, smelt, and mold sand and glass within a radius of about one foot from each hand with the power of his or her mind alone. This gives a +4 bonus on relevant craft rolls, reduces the amount of equipment needed, and looks neat.
Greater Banner										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This flamboyant battle standard is easily seen and recognized across a whole battlefield and may - if the situation is desperate, or the leader is sufficiently legendary - negate morale penalties once per day for every ally on the field when first raised.
Haunting Pipes										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:The melody of these multiple pipes can carry dreams, visions and emotional influences to susceptible - or sleeping - minds. The effects carry as far as the music does and are especially potent when used in conjunction with bardic talents.
Helm of War											TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This provides Heavy Fortification; each time it's called upon to prevent an effect it costs a charge. Helms typically hold 2d4 charges, regaining one per week.
Industrious Tool										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:Anyone wielding a tool with this charm upon it can accomplish three times as much work in a given interval.
Ironcloth Loom										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:Cloth woven on this loom is tough, water repellent, almost unstainable, readily cleaned, fire resistant, and lasts for many years. Clothing made from it has a +1 "armor" bonus without any penalties, although this is superseded by armor bonuses. Similar items are used to make enhanced paper, non-rusting implements, better rope, cleaner and finer flour, and so on. The products of such talismanic screens, forges, and mills are a bit more expensive - but are generally well worth it.
Martyr's Blades										TYPE:Talisman.Unique						SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:Blessed by the lingering touch of heroes who sacrificed themselves in battle against the powers of darkness, such weapons gain "+2" properties (usually either; +1 Ghost Touch, Bane, Disruption, or Holy) for about ten minutes when the wielder channels 2D4 HP into them to power them up. If the battle cry of the original martyr is invoked the cost is reduced to 1D4 HP. They're usually only usable a few times in any one day.
Mother's Tears Amulet									TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This useful amulet grants a minor stroke of good luck once per day, providing a +3 bonus on a particular save or on the user's AC for a round. While the amulet acts on its own to provide a narrow escape, in game terms its use is announced after the relevant rolls are made.
Preserving Chest										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This cedar-lined trunk, closet - or pantry - keeps anything stored within it safe from the ravages or time and vermin. Meat will stay fresh, clothing undamaged, and so on. The size may vary from a small trunk to a large walk-in closet.
Ray of Hope											TYPE:Talisman.Unique						SOURCEPAGE:201	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:A drop of celestial light caught in a vial, feather, or similar token, a Ray of Hope can be called on 2d4 times before it dissolves in a burst of light. When activated, it inspires those good beings within 30 Ft (+2 Morale Bonus to all Checks, Saves, Attacks, Damage, and AC) for ten minutes and may, at the game master's option, cause any one additional effect (usually chosen from among: Turn Undead/Evil Outsiders, Dispel Darkness, Cure Moderate Wounds or Dismissal) in a similar area at an effective level of 20. Rays of Hope can be "created", but it takes an extremely powerful and holy priest to do so.
Rubydraught											TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:When filled with wine and dried berries this crystal flask produces a rich cordial equivalent to a Goodberry spell (cast once per day at caster level 3).
Rune Weapons										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:Inscribed with mystic runes these +1 weapons may have any one of the following properties: Keen, Throwing, Eager (Jumps into your hand when it's needed from up to 10 Ft away as a free action), Rally (Bless spell when brandished up to [Charisma Mod] Times/Day), Warning (vibrates/hums when within 30 of a particular type of foe), Good/Evil (counts as a blessed/accursed weapon against foes with such vulnerabilities) and Travel (the user always knows which way is north). Other runes may exist. Due to this variety, this "formula" counts as two.
Serpentine Rope										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This rope acts as if affected by an Animate Rope spell, but can also be commanded to strike up to 10 feet.
Shifter's Cloak										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This item of clothing permits it's wearer to take the form of a particular animal. It costs 1 Charge, 1D2 points of temporary Intelligence damage, and accepting a dose of animal instincts, to change into an animal. It costs one charge to change back. Since such items typically have 3d4 charges, and can only be recharged with a minor ritual, they're best used with caution.
Spell Catalysts										TYPE:Talisman.Unique						SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These reduce the "effective level" of a particular spell or spells of up to level four by one - and may be used up to three times a day. Most spell catalysts are natural; for example, Unicorn Horns act as a catalyst for several curative spells. Of course, they only shed their horns once a century. Catalyst Charms are similar, but can only affect spells of up to L3 and have 3D4 charges when new. Some of the most potent catalysts, such as Dragon Bones, can have very strange side effects when bonded to your personal energies.
Spirit Pearl										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:Occasional magi imprison outsiders within pearls. Set into amulets, such pearls can be used as talismans; the user may cloak himself and those in a small radius with the aura of the spirit within. Brave - or reckless - wielders may try to draw upon the powers of the spirit within directly up to three times per day - however if they fail an opposed willpower check the spirit within may employ one of its powers as it so pleases. While it cannot release itself from the pearl few wielders find such an event congenial.
Stone of Sustenance									TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This stone allows the user to function without food, drink, or rest, for up to four weeks - but the user must make up for it afterwards.
Shimmer Mail										TYPE:Talisman		DEFINE:ShimmerMailACBonus|0	SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|ShimmerMailACBonus|TYPE=Armor						BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1	BONUS:VAR|ShimmerMailACBonus|4	SPROP:This mail is as light as normal clothing. It has no armor check penalty, max Dex bonus, or arcane failure, but has a +% armor bonus.|ShimmerMailACBonus
Timeless Rune										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:This runic amulet induces suspended animation, although it's easy to resist. It's used in cases of mystical poisoning, slowly-lethal wounds and in other special circumstances.
Tulthara											TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:These create temporary "weapons" made of magical energy. These are considered magical and can do either stun or normal damage, but are otherwise equal to normal weapons. How they look is, however, more or less up to the maker. If you want a "holy book that fires bolts of black lightning" (likely equal to a bow of some sort), you can get one.
Zakari Stormbow										TYPE:Talisman							SOURCEPAGE:p.202	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Charms and Talismans														BONUS:VAR|TalismanCount|1							SPROP:The shafts fired from this repeating crossbow detonate on impact (ranged touch attacks) as per flasks of "Alchemist's Fire" up to (3 +L/3) times per day. It's used as a simple weapon. Minor variants fire bolts which cause electrical, cold, acid, force, or even divine (Clerics only) damage.

#Seals are more limited devices designed to aid specific types of magic. Theyre most commonly made in the form of rings, since they incorporate fairly decent gems. Unfortunately, they cannot be used to amplify spells of above L3. They are, however, much simpler to make than Talismans.

#Specific Seals include
# These Boost either a School of Magic or a Descriptor. All Set Up as best I could. They increase with Level of user. Need to review formula. The Only Issue is if there are two then the Var will conflict; Perhaps a TYPE needs to be appended to avoid any conflict?
# Solution? Have it call an ability with the master forumla. Will have to review the Formula and see if there is a better solution. -AM May/13/2010 2:32pm PDT
