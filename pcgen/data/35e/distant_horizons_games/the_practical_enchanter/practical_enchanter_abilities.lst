This is often well worthwhile.																																																																TEMPLATE:Poor Wealth ECL Modifier																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.186

# Wealth Level Selection Abilities that are grouped in that Tier. Note: Unable to Implement a step up as in the Above your Wealth Section. Would require something like alt ability to select.
# Currently not worth the effort at the moment.

# Current Wealth - Destitute
Wealth Level / 01 Destitute					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Destitute			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTDestitute			DESC:You're stone broke, usually hungry, and hopelessly ill-equipped. At the GM's option you may own a single item of value, such as your old sword, an heirloom. or some item of unknown properties. Typical equipment here includes rusty, worn knives, tattered clothing, improvised padded armor, and other rubbish.																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.184
Wealth Level Perk / Armor, Shields, and Weapons		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Destitute Equipment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTDestitute																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.184				BENEFIT:Even if pristine to start with, any armor, shields, or weapons you pick up will shortly be in horrible shape. Half AC bonus from armor and shields (minimum +1 apiece), weapons get -2 to hit and damage.
Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				KEY:Wealth Template ~ Destitute Magic		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTDestitute																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.184				BENEFIT:You might possess a single charm, provided that something weird is going on.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets, and Familiars		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Destitute Companions	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTDestitute																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.184				BENEFIT:Any mount you can lay your hands on gets -5 move, one-half normal HP, and a -3 on all rolls. As far as pets and familiars go, you could probably manage a rat or something.
Wealth Level Perk / Recognition				KEY:Wealth Template ~ Destitute Recognition	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTDestitute																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.184				BENEFIT:Even people who know you are likely to pretend they don't. Anyone at this wealth level gains a +2 circumstance modifier to Disguise and Knowledge: Local.
Wealth Level Perk / Training					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Destitute Training		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTDestitute																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.184				BENEFIT:Training: +2 Skill points per level gained at this wealth rank in any of skills listed above; -2 on any two chosen attributes due to illness/hunger exposure/ etc while the character remains at this wealth level.

# Current Wealth - Poor
Wealth Level / 02 Poor						KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor				DESC:It's no feast - but you usually get enough to eat, sleep relatively warm, and can feed the kids. There isn't much to spare, and sadly enough, the vast majority of humanity has subsisted at this level throughout history. Almost any kind of job, or acting as casual labor, supports this level of wealth, as will minor criminal activities																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.185
Wealth Level Perk / Armor, Shields, and Weapons		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Equipment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.185				BENEFIT:There really isn't any money to spare for this; staves, slings, clubs, improvised spears, and work knives, are about the limit. You can usually get someone to make up a crude suit of padded armor for you. Your best bet is to try to join the militia; that'll get you some basic gear, such as leather armor, spear, shortsword, small wooden shield, and a few javelins along with the training to use them effectively.
Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.185				BENEFIT:One minor, and usually utilitarian, charm. Fire- and light- stones, healing charms, minor enhanced tools, and other handy items are the most common.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets And Familiars		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.185				BENEFIT:Any animals you have are going to either be common, inexpensive working beasts or sources of food. Ferrets are useful, if a bit pungent. A pack-ox or horse is possible, a real mount is unlikely.
Wealth Level Perk / Acquaintances				KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Aquaintances		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.185				BENEFIT:Guildmembers, past employers, and possibly a few members of the local underworld. If you really need an assistant, you may be able to manage an apprentice, impressionable kid, or one of your relatives.
Wealth Level Perk / Training					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Poor Training			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTPoor																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.185				BENEFIT:Any character who levels while at this wealth level gains +2 SP to be spent on Profession, Craft, Bluff, or Gather Information, but it's rare for an adventurer to spend much time at this level.

# Current Wealth - Common
Wealth Level / 03 Common					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon				DESC:You live decently, and can even afford a bit of education, a few books, a larger family, and good tools. If you decide to "go adventuring" you can afford basic equipment, although usually not an especially wide assortment of it. This is the most common default starting point for characters from the lower classes, implying a reasonably successful career as a craftsman, lesser crook, farmer, guard, or whatever.																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.186
Wealth Level Perk / Armor, Shields, and Weaponry	KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Equipment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:You can afford light armor, shields, common, inexpensive, weapons (shortswords, short bows, javelins, etc) and equipment of ordinary quality.
Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:Normally three minor "charms." At least at first, these will usually be utilitarian, but the definition of "utilitarian" can vary a good deal depending on the character's background.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets, and Familiars		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:You can obtain common animals, a light riding horse (likely a bit long in the tooth, but serviceable) and a healthy mutt to act as a guard dog. "Noble" animals, including hawks, purebred hounds, hunting cats, warhorses and exotic imports, are still out of reach.
Wealth Level Perk / Retainers					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Retainers		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:You may have a house- or errand-boy and know an old woman or man who purports to be a witch. For the most part you won't know anyone the least bit important.
Wealth Level Perk / Training					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Common Training		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTCommon																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:Any character who levels while at this wealth level gains no special benefits, and suffers no unusual penalties.

# Current Wealth - Well Off
Wealth Level / 04 Well Off					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff				DESC:You're doing pretty well, at least for a normal crafter or small businessman, younger son, petty noble, very prosperous farmer, minor trader, caravan master, or minor governmental official. You're quite unlikely to be especially influential, but you probably know people who are. A reasonably successful mercenary, minor specialist, respectable priest, or starting-off upper class adventurer, will usually fall into this category.																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.186
Wealth Level Perk / Armor, Shields, and Weapons		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Equipment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:You can afford full plate armor, exotic weapons, longbows and specialized equipment. Still, at least for the time, masterwork equipment remains out of reach.
Wealth Level Perk / Magical Items				KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Magic		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:Three charms and one talisman.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets, and Familiars		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:You can afford high quality common animals, trained warhorses, and so on. Exotic imports are still simply too expensive.
Wealth Level Perk / Retainers					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Retainers		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:You may have a single extremely loyal assistant, guard, or henchman, connections with assorted skilled professionals in various fields and a dozen or so ordinary employees. While these usually won't be going on adventures, they make life a lot easier most of the time.
Wealth Level Perk / Training					KEY:Wealth Template ~ Well Off Training		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTWellOff																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.186				BENEFIT:Any character who levels while at this wealth level gains no special benefits, and suffers no unusual penalties.

A manor, several houses, mystical tower, splendid apartments, or fine mansion is probably in order.																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.187
Wealth Level Perk / Armor, Shields, and Weapons		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Affluent Equipment		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTAffluent																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.187				BENEFIT:Are all treated as being "masterwork." The character can readily afford to buy specialized equipment from high-quality crafters.
Wealth Level Perk / Legal Privileges			KEY:Wealth Template ~ Affluent Legal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTAffluent																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.187				BENEFIT:Characters at this level enjoy a good deal of leeway about things like the use of deadly force against an "attacker," carrying armor, shields, and weapons, or riding in the city streets, and will virtually always get the benefit of the doubt unless the other side is even richer. It's also almost impossible to drive you insane; you're usually limited to eccentric.
Wealth Level Perk / Mounts, Pets, and Familiars		KEY:Wealth Template ~ Affluent Companions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.WTAffluent																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.187				BENEFIT:You can afford exotic pets, like fine hawks and rare imported animals.

#
Arcanum Minimus / Ambient Magic			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Ambient Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:Conventionally used to power cantrips and trivial talismans, ambient magical energy is freely available, but very weak. The casting time increases greatly - from free actions to actions, from actions to minutes, and from minutes to hours. Ambient magic cannot power spells that normally require more than ten minutes to cast.																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Catalyst Materials		KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Catalyst Materials		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:The magical forces which lie within certain materials selected by the game master (a vampire's fang, the dust from a dragon's eggshell, ogre magi blood, odd minerals and rare earths, magical woods, certain crystals, etc), may be tapped to power magic. Sadly, such materials are difficult to acquire and are only good for a limited number of castings of particular spells before their power is exhausted.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Chaos			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Chaos		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:Calling on the powers of Chaos to aid you is straightforward, but reckless. The caster must save against his or her own spell (use Will if no save is specified): On a "1", it goes drastically wrong and produces a wild magical effect rather than what you want. On a failure, or a "2" in any case, it is somewhat distorted or has strange side effects (treat as a secondary spell of up to one-half of the original spell's power level).																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Life Energy				KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Life Energy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:One of the most common sources of extra energy for spells, but also one of the least friendly, this technique draws out the internal strength of the caster. Spellcasters using this energy source may draw on their own life force, either saving against their own spell (Will if no save is listed) to avoid fatigue (doing this twice causes the exhausted state as usual) or expending HP (usually Spell Level/2 d6), XP (5 per spell level), or temporary attribute drain (usually 1d4) in the spellcasting. Ruthless mages may draw on the life energy of sacrifices (small animals and large plants will suffice for low-level spells; a ninth level spell might require multiple sentient beings), or on the surrounding environment. Using this option reduces soil and vegetation to lifeless ash in a radius of roughly 3 feet per level of the spell, a condition that may persist for lengthy periods. This is definitely an evil act and is unpopular with everything dependent on the land.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Magical Devices			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Magical Devices		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:The energies stored within charged, or "uses-per-day", magical items may provide power for compatible spells. Simply enough, this depletes one charge or use per spell. Certain items, such as the Rod of Wonder, are compatible with almost any spell. The GM must rule on compatibility for other items. In general, a similar effect or descriptor is compatible.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Darkness		KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Darkness		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:The forces of corruption are always ready to supply quick and easy power - for a price. Black magic slowly twists and warps thosewho use it, leaving a taint that's difficult to purge away. This is represented by an accumulating Corruption score. Calling on black magic normally results in 1d4 points of corruption. When your corruption score exceeds your current Will save (plus constant bonuses) plus your stage of descent you must make a Will save (DC 13 if you've been using your magic for good purposes, 16 if you've been using it for a general tool, 21 if you've been using it for selfish or evil purposes) or descend a step into the power of evil. On a success, the mage has resisted the temptations of the powers of darkness. In either case, the corruption score resets to zero. Barring such a dramatic resolution, a character's corruption score falls by one point a week automatically, by one point a day via penance, rituals, or meditation in a holy place, and by 1d4 points whenever the character makes a great commitment to good or a major sacrifice in its pursuit.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Powers of Light			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Powers of Light		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:The powers of light are stern and demanding masters, as pure and terrible as the fires of the sun. The price of drawing upon such power is purity of purpose, mind, and spirit: being a sword to stand against the darkness. This is hell on your social life. Unfortunately, unless a character lives up to very high standards, his or her spells start fizzling as the powers that be, whatever they are, decline to help him or her out. Optionally, similar benefits can be derived from the Lords of Order, but such entities issue endless orders and directives. Few mortals care to call on them.																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Karmic Debts			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Karmic Debts			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:Calling on supernatural beings to help you out has one basic flaw: they tend to want you to return the favor, and are powerful enough to enforce such a debt. While they rarely call upon low level characters, truly powerful individuals make truly useful pawns. Karmic debts are unlikely to be a problem at first, but lead to many unanticipated adventures later. As a variation, a character might be linked with some sort of minor entity, which the caster must keep happy if he or she wishes to continue using such spells. In either case, the karmic creditor sends irresistible curses if the character refuses to pay up.																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Reduced Power			KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Reduced Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:This isn't actually a power source; it's what happens when a spell is cast without building up the power to do it properly, usually due to failure to fulfill other conditions from this list. Spells suffer a -2 on the DC of saving against them and a -4 on the effective caster level per "missing" condition. Factors such as duration and range are reduced as the game master wishes. A few very high-level mages may not care ("So who cares if it only goes off at L12? It maxes out at 10!"), but lesser magi need every scrap of power they can muster.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Arcanum Minimus / Special Conditions		KEY:Arcanum Minimus ~ Special Conditions		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ArcanumMinimusFeatChoice								DESC:The spell is more restricted than usual. It may require peculiar environmental conditions (e.g., moonlight), that the caster possess special knowledge or skills (such as a target's "True Name" or an extensive knowledge of biophysics), won't affect certain targets, and so on. In general, this is a catch-all category. On the other hand, if the limitation doesn't really limit the spell, it certainly doesn't count. A Fireball which only affects enemies is improved, not restricted. In general, mages shouldn't make a habit of using many of these; special conditions should be closely tied to the character concept or an integral part of very special spells. Optionally, the game master may permit spells to gain up to a -3 level modifier from special conditions, provided that they are both extremely specific (e.g. only during the great once-a-century conjunction at the Gate of Ebon while holding the Scepter of Night) and have been built into the spell formula.
