THE OPEN GAMING LICENSE
It has been nearly two years since the Open Gaming License was released, in conjunction with a substantial portion of the core DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game material in the form of the System Reference Document. Since then, many publishers have had a chance to use the material developed by Wizards of the Coast in their own products to bring you a variety of d20 System™ compatible releases. Now, it’s time for Wizards of the Coast to take its first step into the same realm. We’ve decided to use some of the best new content created by another publisher—the razor boar and scorpionfolk, the creatures described on this page and the facing page—as a supplement to the monsters in Monster Manual II. 

How did these monsters come to be here? One of the very first d20 publishers, Necromancer Games (and its publisher, Sword & Sorcery Studios) came out with The Creature Collection, a compendium of various kinds of monsters found in the company’s Scarred Lands campaign world. As an example of the good work to be found in that collection, we’ve “adopted” these two creatures and decided to include them in an official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS product. The folks at Necromancer were kind enough to give us a little background on the designers of the monsters so we could ensure they got proper credit here, and we’re thankful for their help and support.

We’ve printed these two descriptions at the end of the book, in a special layout, to make it clear that only these two monsters are considered Open Game Content. The rest of the material in this book is still closed content, and can’t be used in other products. You can see the System Reference Document and a number of interesting and helpful d20 System materials at www.wizards.com/d20. The full text of the Open Gaming License appears on page 222 of this book.

Over the long term we hope to use more and more material created by the independent pool of d20 System designers and publishers, just as they are using the Open Content material created by Wizards of the Coast. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we’re all able to partake of the shared design resources that operate under the Open Gaming License.

As we continue to add Open Game Content to the pool of available material via the System Reference Document, we hope to help the d20 System evolve and constantly become more fun to play, easier to work with, and the centerpiece of a rewarding hobby. It is our pleasure to share those objectives with all the other publishers who have joined us in this great Open Gaming adventure!
