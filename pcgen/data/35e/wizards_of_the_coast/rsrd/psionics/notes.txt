Some SAs need correcting.

Aboleth: +16 swim modifier, it should be +8 (see bug report)
Caller in Darkness: +2 deflection bonus from Incorporeal missing
Gray Glutton: Jump +18 instead of +14 (PCgen indicates a +12 modifier and 6 ranks, but Str gives it +8. Where does the other +4 come from?)
Neothelid: Saves are all off by +2. Effects of Epic bonuses kicking in? Psychic Thrust is missing from rsrd_powers.
Psion-Killer: HP not correct in PCGen (Construct HP not added)
Puppeteer (Flesh Harrower): RSRD error, they forgot to add the size modifier to AC
Thought Slayer: Extra +8 to Jump in PCGen. Don't know where it comes from.
Udoroot: PCGen gives an extra +5 AC somehow. RSRD lists "-5 Dex" in the AC entry.
