Accurate Jaunt		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to greater teleport, plane shift, teleport, or shadow walk spell.	DESC:[Not Implemented] You have an instinctive sense of interplanar travel.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.92	BENEFIT:When you use teleport, you can roll the targeting roll twice, taking whichever result you prefer. When you use plane shift or shadow walk, you likewise make the roll to determine your destination twice, choosing the better (usually lower) result.
Bladeproof Skin		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to stoneskin or iron body spell.							DESC:[Not Implemented] Your skin has a degree of protection from even the sharpest edge.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.92	BENEFIT:You gain damage reduction 3/bludgeoning. Your skin imposes an armor check penalty of -2 (which stacks with the armor check penalty from armor and shield).
Breadth of Knowledge	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to legend lore or vision spell.							DESC:[Not Implemented] Your time spent plumbing the depths of magic knowledge has resulted in a treasure trove of obscure facts.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.92	BENEFIT:All Knowledge checks you make are treated as trained checks, even if you don't have any ranks in the specific skill. If you have at least one rank in the specific Knowledge skill in question, you gain a +1 bonus on the check.
Conductivity		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to call lightning, lightning bolt, or chain lightning spell.		DESC:[Not Implemented] You have crude control over electricity effects near you.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.92	BENEFIT:Whenever you take damage from an electricity effect, you may send a line of electricity arcing from your body at any single target within 30 feet. This bolt deals half the damage you just took; a Reflex save (DC 16 + your Cha modifier) halves this damage.
Controlled Immolation	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to fireball or delayed blast fireball spell.					DESC:[Not Implemented] If you catch on fire, the flames don't hurt you.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.92	BENEFIT:If you catch on fire (as described on page 303 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), you take no damage from the flames. A creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage. The fire persists on your body for 1d4 rounds. This feat doesn't protect you from other sources of fire dam age, whether magical or not, only from the effects of catching on fire. It also doesn't protect your equipment from the effects of fire.
Eyes to the Sky		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to scrying or greater scrying spell.						DESC:[Not Implemented] You have an instinctive sense of when someone is magically watching you.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.93	BENEFIT:You automatically spot the magical sensor created by a spell of the scrying subtype (arcane eye, clairaudience/clairvoyance, greater scrying, or scrying) if it's within 40 feet of you.
False Pretenses		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to charm or dominate spell.								DESC:[Not Implemented] Those who try to charm you get an unpleasant surprise.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.93	BENEFIT:When you succeed on a save against a charm or compulsion effect, the character trying to charm or compel you believes that you failed your save. You can play along voluntarily if you wish to. If the charm or compulsion involves telepathic commands, you continue to receive them, although you aren't obligated to follow them.
Ineluctable Echo		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to wail of the banshee or any power word spell.				DESC:[Not Implemented] Those who use words of power around you hear the sound of their own voices.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.93	BENEFIT:When you are targeted by a power word spell, whoever speaks the power word is also affected by it (as if he had cast it on himself). Likewise, when you're within the area of a wail of the banshee spell, the caster of the spell also hears the wail and must succeed on a Fortitude save (using his own save DC) or die. Possessing the Ineluctable Echo feat doesn't protect you against power word or wail of the banshee spells. You experience their effects normally.
Life Leech			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to death touch domain granted power or death knell spell.			DESC:[Not Implemented] You automatically try to steal the last bit of life energy from anyone nearby.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.93	BENEFIT:Each dying or stable creature within 30 feet of you (that is, any creature with -1 to -9 hit points) loses an additional 1 hit point at the beginning of your turn. You gain the same amount as temporary hit points that last for 10 minutes. You can't suppress this effect, which functions on both friend and foe.
Live My Nightmare		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to phantasmal killer spell.								DESC:[Not Implemented] Those who magically pry into your mind become privy to your most frightening dreams.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:Whenever someone successfully targets you with a divination spell or effect, you can send that caster a nightmarish vision. This vision functions as a phantasmal killer spell, except that the form comes from your dreams, not the other creature's dreams. The other creature must succeed on a Will save (DC 14 + your Cha modifier) to disbelieve the nightmare and a Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Cha modifier) to avoid dying from fear.
Momentary Alteration	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to alter self spell.									DESC:[Not Implemented] You can briefly transform yourself into a second form, acquiring its physical qualities.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:Choose one specific form that you've turned yourself into with the alter self spell. Once per day, you can use alter self as a spell-like ability to turn yourself into this form for 1 minute. Special: You can gain Momentary Alteration multiple times. Each time you take the feat, you can either extend the duration of an already chosen alternate form by 1 minute or choose another specific form from among those you've experienced after casting alter self on yourself.
Naturalized Denizen	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to dimensional anchor spell.								DESC:[Not Implemented] You are unusually anchored to your location.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:You are never treated as an extraplanar creature (and you lose the extraplanar subtype). Thus, you can't be affected by a banishment or dismissal spell or similar effects that send extraplanar creatures back to their home planes.
Omniscient Whispers	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to commune or contact other plane spell.						DESC:[Not Implemented] A constant, barely audible muttering echoes in your ears, usually beyond your comprehension. But if you focus all your energy on listening, you sometimes catch a sentence or two that bears directly on your current situation.	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:Once per week, you can tune into the voices you hear, getting the answer to a question much as if you had asked it with a commune spell. Using this feat renders you exhausted.
Photosynthetic Skin	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to barkskin spell.									DESC:[Not Implemented] Your skin toughens when it draws energy from the sun.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:Whenever you're outside during the day, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor (characters who don't have natural armor ordinarily have a natural armor bonus of +0).
Polar Chill			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to cone of cold or ice storm spell.						DESC:[Not Implemented] You can call forth the cold of the arctic regions, making movement and fighting difficult for the unprepared.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can make the ground icy in a 20- foot-radius spread around you. Each square in that area becomes covered with ice, so it takes two squares of movement to enter each square, and the DC of Balance and Tumble checks there increases by 5. A DC 10 Balance check is required to run or charge across the ice. The ice remains for 1 minute or until exposed to fire. You can't use this feat if you aren't touching the ground, and it doesn't work if the air temperature is above 100 degrees.
Residual Rebound		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to spell resistance or spell turning spell.					DESC:[Not Implemented] Sometimes spells cast at you rebound on the caster instead.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:If you roll a natural 20 on a save against a targeted spell, it turns back on the caster as if affected by a spell turning spell. Unlike spell turning, however, the Residual Rebound feat potentially functions against touch range spells as well. Residual Rebound only works on targeted spells that allow a saving throw, so a fireball won't rebound, nor will a power word stun.
Stench of the Dead	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Spelltouched	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Exposure to ghoul touch or vampiric touch spell.						DESC:[Not Implemented] The odor of decay hangs heavy on you, causing others to gasp and retch.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.94	BENEFIT:You exude a carrion stench that causes any creature adjacent to you to make a Fortitude save (DC 12 + your Cha modifier) or become sickened as long as it remains adjacent to you and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. You can't suppress the stench voluntarily.
