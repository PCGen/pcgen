DESC:Within this short product, the Mystic Theurge is expanded upon, three additional paths of theurgy are explored (elemetal theurges, the lord of undeath, and the theurgic lorewarden), as well as the quintessential master of theurgy - the heirophant theurge. The product is rounded off with a small selection of theurgic feats and magic items appropriate to a game where theurgy is a central element, either through player involvement in the class or through adventures about theurgists and their churches.
