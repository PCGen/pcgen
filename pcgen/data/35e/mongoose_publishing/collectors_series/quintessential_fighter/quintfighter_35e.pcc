DESC:Heralded as the first true class book for the d20 system, The Quintessential Fighter provides vital information for any player wishing to exploit his Fighter character to the fullest. Since the game was first created, many years ago, Fighters have always had a rough deal when compared to the more esoteric classes such as Cleric, Rogue and Wizard. The Quintessential Fighter redresses this balance, taking the Fighter class further than it has ever been before. Weighing in at 128 pages, The Quintessential Fighter is jam-packed full of useful rules and rules sub-systems, making this class ever more flexible and capable.
