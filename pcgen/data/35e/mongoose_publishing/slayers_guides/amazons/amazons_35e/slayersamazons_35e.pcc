DESC:Throughout history and legend, amazons have always stood firm as the ultimate warrior women, the ideal of female triumph in a male dominated world. But who are the amazons, a race who counts the deepest jungles as their domain and ruthlessly slays any intruder? The Slayer's Guide to Amazons peels back the fog of myth and legend to reveal, for the very first time, the true story of these incredible women.
