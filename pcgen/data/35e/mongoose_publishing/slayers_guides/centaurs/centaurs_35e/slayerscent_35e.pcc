DESC:Whilst it is true centaurs are a highly secretive race, there are those who have had prolonged contact with them. Most swear themselves to silence with regards to the things they have seen and heard in their time with the enigmatic creatures, but a few have seen fit to record and relate their experiences. Whole generations of adventurers are in debt to such people. The Slayer's Guide to Centaurs compiles the knowledge of all these wise people into one invaluable tome, though no responsibility can be taken as to what adventurers might actually do with this resource. Only this will be said - if you plan foul play against centaurs, be prepared to face the most capable of enemies. Evil to he who thinks evil.
