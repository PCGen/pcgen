DESC:Encyclopaedia Arcane: Necromancy - Beyond the Grave provides Games Masters and players alike with all the information they need to introduce this macabre form of magic into their campaigns. The specialist Necromancer now has access to a huge range of new spells, from the simple animation of small rodents to the raising of great death hulks from the bottom of the ocean. He will now be able to manipulate the dark powers present in negative energy directly, without recourse to simple spellcasting if he is willing to take the inherent risks. Such a wizard may also discover the knowledge necessary to begin the transformation into a Lich. More paths in the study of Necromancy may also be found - the Spectral Loremaster who speaks directly with the dead to aid his learning, the Deathseeker who utilises the rush of negative energy present in death to power awesome magicks and the hideous Necrophage, an aberration who grafts the body parts of others onto himself in order to gain their power. Will you step beyond the grave?
