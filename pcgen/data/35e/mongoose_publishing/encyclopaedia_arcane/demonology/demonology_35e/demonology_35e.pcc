DESC:Welcome, mortal, to the Dark Road. Within these secret pages you will find the most forbidden knowledge of all - that of summoning, binding and ultimately controlling the demons, devils and fiends of the infernal planes. This book is not for the faint of heart for only the strongest of wills may dare to dabble in the blackest art of all. The perils are great and the dangers terrifying but for those willing to gamble their very souls, the rewards are far greater than any mortal can possibly conceive. Encyclopaedia Arcane: Demonology - The Dark Road provides Games Masters and players alike with all the information they need to introduce this dangerous form of magic into their campaigns. The Demonologist character class is presented alongside those who go far deeper into the art, the mysterious Binder and the dreaded Possessed. Each has access to the most incredible powers, drawn from the very forces of evil itself. How far will you dare travel the Dark Road?
