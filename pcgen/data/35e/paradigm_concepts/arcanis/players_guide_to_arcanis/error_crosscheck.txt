  -(Line 189): The CHOOSE tag is mandantory when MULT:YES is present in ABILITY "Dragon Apotheosis"

Eddy: if the CHOOSE is for a temporary bonus then MULT:YES is not needed and prettylst will give you a false positive, in this case there is no choose, you have a TEMPLATE:CHOOSE: which is not the same thing and the MULT:YES should be removed.

  -(Line 315): the CASTERLEVEL= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|Polymorph (OID)"

   (Line 41): Forgot to use var()? Dubious use of Jep variable assignation near "CL=" in "BONUS:VAR|BardicKnowledgeLevel|((CL=Althares)/2)"

Eddy: Prettylst will give you this JEP warning even though "CL=Name" is valid, it's just not JEP, however...

If you have a CL=Name used in a class that is referencing itself you should always just use "CL". 
This is because if the class is .COPYed then the CL references will work in the new class, however...

The reference used above, CL=Althares, is not valid. It is within a subclass named "Priest of Althares"  
so the first error is that CL always refers to class (in this case Priest) never subclass, 
and the second error is that even if it did you didn't use the full name of the subclass.

The fix here is to change the refernce to "CL" alone.


  -(Line 170): Missing BONUS:CASTERLEVEL for "CLASS:Holy Champion"

Eddy: looks like you got the BONUS:CASTERLEVEL on all the subclass lines, should probably delete those and just put one on the class line.

I suspect it doesn't in which case you can put the tag in a hidden feat and put the PRESUBCLASS on a VFEAT

TEMPLATE:ADDCHOICE is always used in a .MOD 
otherwise how does PCGen know which TEMPLATE:CHOOSE you are adding choices too?
