Low-Light Vision			KEY:Low-Light Vision	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:LowLightDistance|0																																							DESC:You can see %1x as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.|LowLightDistance																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		BONUS:VAR|LowLightDistance|2	VISION:Low-Light Vision (LowlightRange)		ASPECT:Vision|Low-Light Vision
Darkvision				KEY:Darkvision		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:DarkvisionRange|0																																							DESC:Range %1;|DarkvisionRange|PREVARGTEQ:DarkvisionRange,1	DESC:Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.|DarkvisionRange																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										VISION:Darkvision (DarkvisionRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Darkvision %1 ft.|DarkvisionRange
Blindsense				KEY:Blindsense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:BlindsenseRange|0																																							DESC:Range %1;|BlindsenseRange|PREVARGTEQ:BlindsenseRange,1	DESC:Other creatures have blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total concealment (50%% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.|BlindsenseRange																																																																																																																																																																																										VISION:Blindsense (BlindsenseRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Blindsense %1 ft.|BlindsenseRange
Blindsight				KEY:Blindsight		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:BlindsightRange|0																																							DESC:Range %1;|BlindsightRange|PREVARGTEQ:BlindsightRange,1	DESC:Some creatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination of such senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can't see ethereal creatures and must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature description. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature's description. If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.&nl;Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight.&nl;Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).&nl;Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight.&nl;Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.&nl;Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.&nl;Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.|BlindsightRange																																																																					VISION:Blindsight (BlindsightRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Blindsight %1 ft.|BlindsightRange
Tremorsense				KEY:Tremorsense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:TremorsenseRange|0																																							DESC:Range %1;|TremorsenseRange|PREVARGTEQ:TremorsenseRange,1	DESC:A creature with tremorsense automatically senses the location of anything that is in contact with the ground and within range. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it's sensing, then the range defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground, and the creatures must be moving. As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting spells with somatic components, they're considered moving; they don't have to move from place to place for a creature with tremorsense to detect them.|TremorsenseRange																																																																																																																																																																																																			VISION:Tremorsense (TremorsenseRange)		ASPECT:Vision|Tremorsense %1 ft.|TremorsenseRange
