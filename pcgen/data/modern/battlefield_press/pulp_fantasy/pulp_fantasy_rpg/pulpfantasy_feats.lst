#Original entry by: Frank Kliewe

#The Highly Skilled feat cannot raise the skill pool at first level, if the class is selected first. To work around this,
#select the feat first by manually putting the number 1 into the Feats remaining field and then clicking the highly
#skilled feat. After that select the class and go back to the feats tab to lower the number in the Feats remaining field
#by 1 again. Highly skilled should also raise the max. skill ranks to character level +5, which isn't currently possible.

#The Linguist feat grants 2 languages whenever a rank in Speak Language skill is taken, instead of the normal 1 language.
#Couldn't find a way to do this.

#The feat Dodge can be replaced as a prerequisite by the Fancy Footwork talent, therefore any PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge should be amended
#as PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Fancy Footwork
