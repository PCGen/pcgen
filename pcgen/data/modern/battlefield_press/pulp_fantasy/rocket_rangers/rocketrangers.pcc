DESC:Welcome to the Vega system. Tyrannical aliens from a world much like our own have conquered the majority of the system. Using the mysterious element 122, which can be refined from ordinary sea water and which powered their spaceships in interplanetary flight, these aliens then developed a hyperdrive and discovered the solar system. Earth was the next planned conquest. Already, they walk among us and recruit criminals to help prepare the Earth for conquest. However, rebel aliens from conquered worlds made their way to the solar system, to both warn the people of Earth and seek help against their overlords. The scientists, engineers, pilots, and soldiers of the Invisible College are their Terran allies, who keep news of the impending alien invasion secret, to avoid both mass panic and to not alert the aliens who walk among us.
