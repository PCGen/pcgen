The arcanolembic can be used to hold one potion. When a creature consumes a potion from the arcanolembic, the potion is treated as if its caster level were 2 higher than the usual minimum for a potion of its level. Placing a potion into the arcanolembic is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ PZOGWK0001-2
