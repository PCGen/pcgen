lion's shield.COPY=Glorymane
Glorymane.MOD																										COST:12370			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=PFS Chronicle,Chronicle ~ S05-11					EQMOD:BRONZE												SOURCELONG:PFS Chronicle #05-11																																			SPROP:Glorymane is a bronze lion's shield specially enchanted by an entity known as the Guardian. The shield has an arrogant streak, despite its inability to express itself through anything but empathetic signals, and it jealously urges its wielder to cast aside any other intelligent items. Glorymane has 5 ranks in Sense Motive and signals its wielder if it detects a lie.

# PFS #5-13
Faith Orb																		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS				COST:2250	WT:0																														SOURCELONG:PFS #5-13 Weapon in the Rift																																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:This brass orb is a bit larger than a human fist. It's covered with symbols of goodness and law and thick studs. If used as an improvised weapon, it deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and serves as a good weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\nThe faith orb is activated when a special stud is depressed, usually marked by a different color metal. Activating the orb is a standard action, though the orb may be thrown as a ranged touch attack (10-foot range increment) as part of the same action used to activate it. At the end of the action or when it hits its target, it triggers a flame strike centered on the orb. Creatures caught in the blast area suffer 9d6 damage as the spell (Reflex DC 17 half). The faith orb is consumed in the process.

Eyeball Jar																		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS				COST:8000	WT:0																														SOURCELONG:PFS #5-14 Day of the Demon																																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:When created, this glass jar has four eyeballs floating in a viscous fluid. As long as the jar contains at least three eyeballs, the eyeball jar grants its weilder all-around vision. Additionally, the eyeball jar grants it's wielder a +2 bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks. Any time the jar's wielder fails a save against a gaze attack, she may, as an immediate action, expend one eyeball to absorb the effects of the gaze attack. Doing so negates the gaze attack's effects as if the wielder made her save, but destroys the eyeball. When the last eyeball in the jar is destroyed, the eyeball jar shatters and becomes useless. A jar found with fewer than four eyeballs is worth 25%% less for each missing eyeball.	EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_4|CHARGES[4]		SPROP:+2 bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks when at least 3 eyes are in the jar.

Dust of Disjunction																		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.PFS				COST:2500	WT:0																														SOURCELONG:PFS #5-16 Sanctum of the Sages																																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:This fine powder looks like crushed diamonds. A single handful of this substance can be thrown in a 15-foot code, at which point it attempts to absorb and neutralize any magic it comes in contact with. The magical properties of each unattended magic item in the area are suppressed for 1d4 rounds as if targeted by dispel magic (caster level 10th). Each creature in the area is affected as if by a targeted dispel magic spell, though the user cannot specify a spell effect to dispel; if a target as no spells affecting it, the dust instead attempts to suppress the abilities of one magic item carried by the target, selected at random following the rules for items surviving a saving throw (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 217). The dust does not affect other ongoing magical effects. Dust of disjunction has a curious effect on golums, which also demonstrate anti-magical properties. A golem exposed to this dust must succeed a DC 17 FOrtitude save or be staggered for 1 minute. At the end of its turn, a staggered golem may attempt a new saving throw to end the staggered effect.

When worn, a talisman of tongues grants its wearer the ability to speak and understand anyone it interacts with as the spell tongues. Furthermore, it provides the wearer a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against language-dependent spells and special abilities.

Simply carrying this crystal provides protection against mental intrusions. Whenever you fail a saving throw against a compulsion effect, gou can attempt a new saving throw at the end of your turn (using the original DC). If you succeed at this saving throw, the effect is negated or reduced (as per the compulsion effect). The crystal may have other powers, but they are not known to you at this time.
