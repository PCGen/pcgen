Pathfinder Society / Guide to Organized Play v6.0

This source also applies pathfinder society specific rule set modifictions necessary for any supported pathfinder society approved additional resources.

Known issues:
- p.11 says "Any religion can be chosen from Core Rulebook, The Inner Sea World Guide, Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Gods and Magic or any other source listed as an official Additional Resource." I have chosen not to automatically include these so that the Core Assumption can be used for Core Campaign play. If you want these choices you will have to explicity add the sources you want access to or use the Pathfinder Society Complete multi-set.
- p.11 also has other rules about valid alignment based on the deity choice which are not implemented in PCGen. Refer to the guide for details.
- p.18 rules for changing faction are not fully implemented. You can track the PP cost using the "Faction Change" ability but none of the other effects of faction change are implemented, e.g. keeping any faction traits, loosing any factio-specific Prestige Awards.
- p.21 day job rules are not implemented.
- p.23 annotation of purchased NPC spellcasting is not supported. Decrement your gold and add a comment to the character bio tab.
- p.23 always available items are not supported. PCGen makes all items available and doesn't track availability by price or type. Consult the guide before making any purchases.
- p.24 prestige points gained per scenario is not supported. You can track your total prestige awards gained by adding "Fame" a total number of times equal to your total Prestige Points.
- p.25 fame's limitation on maximum value of item pruchases is not implemented beyond a simple description in the Fame ability. The inventory tab of PCGen always shows all items ragerdless of price. Consult the guide and your Fame item purchase limits before making purchases.
- p.29 the chronicle sheet award changes for Free RPG Day are not implemented. No chronicle sheet Prestige Point, XP or Gold awards are specifically implemented. Modify your gold, prestige and XP manually according to the scenarios you played.
