Living Construct						KEY:Relluk ~ Living Construct						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Traits.Relluk RacialTrait.SpecialQuality																																								DESC:Unlike other constructs, a relluk has a Constitution score, makes Fortitude saves, and is not immune to mind-affecting spells or abilities. Relluks are also at risk from death from massive damage, nonlethal damage, stunning, fatigue, exhaustion, ability damage, ability drain, death effects, and necromancy effects. Relluks do have immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, petrification, disease, nausea, effects that cause the sickened condition, and energy drain. A relluk does not need to sleep, though a relluk wizard must still rest for 8 hours before preparing spells. A relluk cannot heal lethal damage naturally, and must be healed magically. They can be affected by spells that target living creatures as well as by those that target constructs. Spells from the healing subschool and supernatural abilities that cure hit point damage or ability damage provide only half their normal effects to a relluk. A relluk is made of stone and non-ferrous metal, and is subject to spells that affect creatures made of or wearing these substances.

Engulf Head					KEY:Gelatinous Orb ~ Engulf Head					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Gelatinous Orb RacialTrait.Race Traits.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Gelatinous orbs have the uncanny ability to jump up and land on a Medium-sized or smaller creature's head, completely engulfing it as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. Opponents can either make an attack of opportunity against the ooze, or a saving throw versus the attack, but not both. If the target forgoes the opportunity attack, it may instead make a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid having its head engulfed. If the save fails, or the target instead opted to make an opportunity attack, the target takes 1d4 acid damage, is blinded, deafened, nauseated, and is in danger of suffocating every round that its head is engulfed. Any attack against a gelatinous orb that has engulfed an opponent's head has a 50%% chance of targeting the engulfed opponent instead.

Sticky					KEY:Tar Jelly ~ Sticky							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Tar Jelly RacialTrait.Race Traits.SpecialQuality																			DESC:Any opponent within 5 feet of the tar jelly who successfully hits it with a melee attack automatically receives a ropey tendril of tar affixed to him. Those affected by the tar tendrils cannot move more than 5 feet away from the tar jelly and take a -2 penalty to AC as long as they are stuck. The tar jelly tendril can be removed by making an opposed Strength check as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tendril (AC 11, damage does not deplete the tar jelly's actual hit points, nor incur a new tendril). The tar jelly cannot move more than 5 feet away from the target, but can release its tendril as a free action. There is no limit to the number of tendrils that a tar jelly can produce, but only one tendril can affect each individual target at a time. A tar jelly has a +4 bonus to attacks opponents that have its tendrils affixed to them.																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.
