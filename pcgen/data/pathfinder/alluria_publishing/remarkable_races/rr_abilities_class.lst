SOURCEPAGE:p.83
Break and bend			KEY:Demolisher ~ Break and bend			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Features.Demolisher Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2rd level, whenever a demolisher scores a critical hit against an opponent that is wielding a non-magical melee weapon, that opponent's weapon obtains the Broken condition (see Appendix 2 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game).

SOURCEPAGE:p.84
Automatic Appraisal		KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Automatic Appraisal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:Entrepreneurs are automatically considered to have rolled a natural 20 for all Appraise skill checks.

SOURCEPAGE:p.84
Knowledge is Power		KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Knowledge is Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:Entrepreneurs have an uncanny knack at remembering tidbits of information.

SOURCEPAGE:p.84
Blindsight				KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Blindsight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:At 2nd level, the entrepreneur's third eye has become so acute that he gains the blindsight ability out to 20 feet. At 8th level, this ability extends to 40 feet. This ability relies on electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) to perceive objects, and is therefore is not affected by sound or scent-based effects. Lightning and electricity effects that occur within the range of this vision, however, temporarily negate this blindsight for 3d6 rounds.																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.84
Curestrike				KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Curestrike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:Also at 2nd level, whenever an entrepreneur hits with a bludgeoning weapon, he deals damage normally yet leaves no visible wounds. In addition, the same amount of damage dealt appears to heal on the target, without actually allowing the target to recover any hit points. This effect only works on living creatures with a discernable biology; creatures such as constructs and undead are immune.																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Silver Tongue			KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Silver Tongue			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:At 3rd level, the entrepreneur gains a +2 competency bonus to Diplomacy and Bluff skill checks. At 6th level, increase the bonus to +4 and at 9th level, increase to +6.																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Trustworthy Aura			KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Trustworthy Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:At 3rd level, the entrepreneur exudes an aura of trustworthiness. Creatures in squares immediately adjacent to the entrepreneur, at his discretion, may incur a penalty to Sense Motive and Perception checks equal to his Charisma modifier or Wisdom modifier (whichever is higher). At 6th level, increase the range to 10 feet and at 9th level, increase to 20 feet. The entrepreneur actively chooses what creatures are affected and when.

Darkvision				KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Darkvision				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:At 4th level, the entrepreneur gains darkvision out to 60 feet. If the entrepreneur already has darkvision, this range does not stack.																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.85
X-ray Vision			KEY:Entrepreneur ~ X-ray Vision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:At 5th level, the entrepreneur's third eye has taken on supernatural properties. Once per day, as a full-round action, he can see what is immediately beyond any barrier up to 3 feet thick. Extraordinary and supernatural vision such as darkvision and blindsight does not extend through this ability; if the area that is being viewed is too dark, then nothing can be seen except darkness. If the barrier is too thick (greater than 3 feet thick), the entrepreneur sees only darkness. This ability does not have any fine tuning, so using it to see through clothes or into containers is generally useless unless at least one foot of empty space exists between the opposite edge of the barrier and the next object. Similarly, barriers made of more than one material are treated as one barrier. For example, if the entrepreneur is standing in front of a metal slab bolted to stone wall with three trolls pressed up against the other side, using X-ray vision shows the room beyond, completely bypassing the metal/stone/troll barrier.									SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Treasure Sense			KEY:Entrepreneur ~ Treasure Sense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:At 7th level, the entrepreneur can sense treasure hoards worth at least 1,000 gp within a range of 200 feet per entrepreneur level. While the entrepreneur does not know the nature or composition of the treasure that he is detecting, he does know the general direction and distance that the treasure is located from him. All treasure within 50 feet of itself can be collectively counted as one treasure hoard. This ability always detects the treasure hoard with the greatest market value. This sense is much like a compass needle; it points directly at the treasure in a straight line, without regard to how to get to the treasure or the safest path. Approximate distance can be estimated with a margin of error of plus or minus 50 feet.																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.85
True Seeing				KEY:Entrepreneur ~ True Seeing			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entrepreneur Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DESC:At 10th level, the entrepreneur can cast true seeing as a spell-like ability up to three times per day. The CL for this ability is equal to the entrepreneur's character level.

SOURCEPAGE:p.85

#CLASS:Golden Muse			SOURCEPAGE:p.86
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Golden Muse ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Golden Muse Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Golden muses are proficient with all simple weapons. They gain no proficiency with armor, but will likely have some defensive proficiency from previous classes.																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.86
Spells per Day			KEY:Golden Muse ~ Spells per Day			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Golden Muse Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:When a new golden muse level is obtained, a golden muse gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This means that she adds the level of golden muse to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a golden muse, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Golden Light			KEY:Golden Muse ~ Golden Light			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Golden Muse Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DESC:At 1st level, the golden muse radiates the effects of a consecrate spell at all times in a 5-foot radius from herself. Other than duration and area of effect, the effects of this ability are identical to a consecrate spell with a CL equal to the golden muse's character level. This effect does not persist outside of the range of the golden muse, and ends immediately when the muse leaves the area. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level the radius of this effect extends an additional 5 feet, reaching a 20-foot radius at 10th level.																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Touch of Gold			KEY:Golden Muse ~ Touch of Gold			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Golden Muse Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:At 2nd level, when a golden muse channels positive energy to heal an ally, the ally gains one additional use of channel positive energy for that day, provided that he has that ability. This effect is not cumulative; the ally can only gain one additional use per day regardless of how many times the golden muse channels positive energy to heal him.																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Golden Strike			KEY:Golden Muse ~ Golden Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Golden Muse Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:At 3rd level, as a swift action, the golden muse chooses one target within the area of her golden light effect to be the target of golden strike. If this target is evil, the golden muse and all allies within the golden light effect add a bonus equal to the level of the golden muse class to all damage rolls made against the target of the golden strike. Allies must be within the golden light effect to gain this bonus, but may move in and out of the area, gaining and losing the bonus respectively.
