DESC:Give Skeletons New Life! Skeletons have always been a danger to young heroes venturing into lonely graveyards and ominous tombs, but these classic monsters are quickly replaced by their more powerful undead. Monster Focus: Skeletons is here to give Game Masters a wealth of options to give these clattering undead new "life". Inside, you'll find a number of options for player characters facing off against skeletons. Options like the Bone Breaker feat, which allows a character to bypass damage reduction, or the new spell Maul of the Righteous, which can crush most skeletons with a single swing. In addition, there are a wide variety of new rules for Game Master to use in their game. There are 7 new magic items like the bone sword, a dreadful weapon that can turn any creature it kills into a skeleton under the wielders control. Game Masters will also find 3 new types of skeleton inside, including the skeletal lord that command the dead and create new minions to serve him.
