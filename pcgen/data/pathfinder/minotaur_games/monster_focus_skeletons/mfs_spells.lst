###Block: Full Spell Descriptions
# Spell Name			Description
Animate Dead (Minor).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as Animate Dead except that it can create one standard humanoid skeleton or zombie with a maximum number of HD equal to your caster level, to a maximum 5 Hit Dice at 5th level. You cannot have more than one undead creature under your control through this spell. If you cast this spell a second time, the first creature immediately crumbles to dust. This creature counts against your maximum limit of undead creatures you can control.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Boneshatter.MOD			DESC:This spell creates a jarring resonance in the bones of any creature in the area. Against skeletons, liches, or other creatures made up primarily of bone, this spell deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level, maximum 5d6. Such creatures can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. Against living creatures with a skeletal structure, this spell causes them to be staggered for one round. Living creatures affected by this spell can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Call the Dead.MOD			DESC:Calling on the grim powers of death, you cause all the corpses in the area to rise up as skeletons under your control. This spell affects corpses buried underground as well, up to a depth of 10 feet, although such undead take 1d4 minutes to claw their way up to the surface. These skeletons can be made into burning or bleeding skeletons at the time of casting by reducing the duration to 10 minutes per level. These undead do not count against your Hit Die limit for the amount of undead you can control. These undead must be commanded as a single group and cannot be split up to perform multiple tasks. If you are slain, these undead immediately crumble to dust.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Corpse Rebellion.MOD		DESC:This spell causes the once living spirit of an undead creature to attempt to regain control of its body. This functions as the confused condition, affecting the undead creature. In addition, if the "act normally" result is rolled and the spirit of the creature would be opposed to being undead, it instead deals damage to itself as if it had rolled that result instead. If the undead fails its Will save, it receives a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect. Mindless undead creatures take a -4 penalty on their saving throws against this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Maul of the Righteous.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a two-handed maul made up of shimmering force. You must have both hands free to cast this spell and the maul appears in your hands upon completion of the spell. You are automatically proficient with this weapon and you receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls for every four caster levels you possess (maximum +5 at 20th level). The maul deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage on a hit (if you are Medium) and has a x3 critical multiplier. The damage from this weapon is not halved against incorporeal creatures. If the weapon strikes an undead creature, it deals 1 additional point of damage per two caster levels. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. If this weapon leaves you possession, the spell immediately ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
