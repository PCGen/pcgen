DESC:Unleash a Horde of the Dead! Zombies are a plague, an ever present threat that must be put down before they become an unstoppable horde. While most adventurers regard them as a nuisance, the common folk know better. Zombies are a rot, sent to gnaw away at the foundation of civilization itself. Monster Focus: Zombies is here to give you the tools you need to make your players fear the walking dead! Inside, you'll find a number of options for player characters facing off against zombies. Options like the Stagger Undead feat, which allows a cleric to stop zombies in their tracks, or the new spell Light of Purity, which can send the undead back to their graves. In addition, there are a wide variety of new rules for Game Master to use in their game. You can litter the map with Corpse Fields, a new hazard that claws and bites those that pass through it, or you can challenge your players with the terrifying Brood Zombie, which can unleash swarms of infected vermin. Game Masters will also find plenty of new magic items, new zombie varieties, and adventure ideas inside.
