Brain Piercer	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																				PRETOTALAB:1											DESC:You know how to put down a zombie.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.1	BENEFIT:Whenever you deal damage with a piercing melee weapon, you can ignore any damage reduction that could normally only be bypassed by weapons dealing slashing damage. If the damage reduction also requires magic, silver, or any other type to bypass it, your weapon must meet that type to bypass the damage reduction.
Stagger Undead	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Channel Positive Energy	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Turn Undead				DEFINE:StaggerUndeadDC|0	DEFINE:StaggerUndeadRounds|0	DESC:You can draw upon the power of your deity to cause undead to be cowed into inaction.	BONUS:VAR|StaggerUndeadDC|10+(ClericChannelEnergyLVL/2)+CHA	BONUS:VAR|StaggerUndeadRounds|max(ClericChannelEnergyLVL/2,1)	SOURCEPAGE:p.1	BENEFIT:You can, as a standard action, expend one use of your channel positive energy to cause all undead within 30 feet to become staggered. Undead receive a Will saving throw (DC %1) to negate the effect. Undead that fail their save are staggered for %2 rounds. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw at the end of each round to end the effect. Undead that are already staggered instead take no action on their turn,  as if stunned, but dealing any damage to such an undead ends the effect. This effect does not stack with itself. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).|StaggerUndeadDC|StaggerUndeadRounds
Too Slow		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge																										DESC:You can easily move past staggered foes.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.1	BENEFIT:You do not provoke attacks of opportunity from moving through the threatened area of staggered foes. In addition, you can move through the space occupied by a staggered creature, but this provokes an attack of  opportunity. This does not allow you to end your move in a staggered creature's space. You can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid this attack of opportunity (DC equal to the creature's CMD).
Zombie Master	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (Necromancy)																							DESC:You are skilled at creating and controlling zombies.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.1	BENEFIT:When determining the total amount of undead you can control, zombies count as if their Hit Dice were reduced to 50%% of their actual total, rounded up to the nearest Hit Die. Add up all the Hit Dice of any zombies you control before reducing their total. In addition, you can create fast zombies and plague zombies anytime you cast a spell that creates zombies (counting their Hit Dice as normal).
