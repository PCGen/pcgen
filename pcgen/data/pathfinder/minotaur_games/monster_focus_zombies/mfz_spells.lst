###Block: Full Spell Descriptions
# Spell Name		Description
Blessed Blade.MOD		DESC:This spell creates a masterwork longsword, etched with the symbol of your god. The blade appears in your hands upon completion of the spell. You are automatically proficient with this weapon and it can be used in place of your holy symbol for any spell that you cast that requires a divine focus. If this weapon leaves you possession, the spell immediately ends. Whenever the blessed blade strikes an undead creature it emits a flash of light that deals an additional 1d6 points of damage to the undead creature. The undead can make a Will save to halve this additional damage. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flesh Rot.MOD		DESC:This spell causes a creature's flesh to rot from its bones and if slain, to rise as a zombie under your control. When you cast this spell, your hand takes on sickly green aura. Using this spell requires a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target takes (min(CASTERLEVEL,12))d6 points of damage. If the target is slain by this attack, it rises as a zombie under your control on the following round (as if using Animate Dead, maximum 12 Hit Dice). The target is allowed a Will save to reduce the damage to (CASTERLEVEL) points. If the save is successful, the target does not rise as an undead, even if the attack kills it. Any bonuses on saving throws against disease apply to this effect. This spell has no effect on targets that are immune to disease.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Light of Purity.MOD	DESC:You emit a flash of holy light that causes lesser undead in the area to crumble to dust while more powerful undead flee from your presence. Undead with (CASTERLEVEL) Hit Dice or less must make a Will save or flee from you as if panicked for 1d4+1 rounds. Those undead with (CASTERLEVEL/2) or less Hit Dice that fail this save are destroyed instead. Undead with more than (CASTERLEVEL) Hit Dice are unaffected. Unintelligent undead take a -4 penalty on their saving throw.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plague Ward.MOD		DESC:This spell makes one creature immune to disease for the duration. This does not cure any diseases the subject has already contracted, nor does it heal any damage, but the target does not have to make any saving throws against disease while this spell is in effect. This does not count as a success or failure for the purposes of curing such diseases. This has no effect against diseases that are also curses, such as mummy rot.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Zombie Plague.MOD		DESC:This spell infects the target with zombie rot. The disease is contracted immediately upon a failed Fortitude save (no onset time). If the target dies while under the effects of this disease, this spell does not confer control of the zombie to the spellcaster. Zombie Rot--spell; save Fort DC as per the spell; onset none; frequency 1 day; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
