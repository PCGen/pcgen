#insert your data here

#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Companion Modifications File tags"
#to find out how the tags in the races file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#These files specify the bonuses that "enhanced companions", such as familiars and a Paladin's special mount, receive from
#associating with the character. Unlike other LST files, these do not start with a name field. The first Example shows the
#entry for a familiar that is associated with a 1st level wizard/sorcerer. The second entry is for the bonus that a bat grants,
#if chosen as familiar.
#
#The FOLLOWER tag is holding a delimited list of classes or variables. If the "master" meets the required level or value in the
#tag, then the companion gains all the benefits as described by the other tags in the line.
#
#The TYPE tag is used to define what the creature is for purposes of display on the resources tab.
#
#The tags COPYMASTERBAB, COPYMASTERCHECK, COPYMASTERHP, and USEMASTERSKILL can be used to define whether the creature uses
#those values based on its master.
#
#The SAB tag is holding a text that will be displayed as Special Ability on the output sheet.
#
#The DEFINESTAT:MINVALUE|INT| tag prevents the specified ability score (Intelligence) to be no lower than the indicated value.
#This allows higher intelligent creature to retain their natural intelligence if higher.
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The RACETYPE tag changes a regular animal to an "enhanced companion" type.
#
#The MASTERBONUSRACE tag is used if you need to define the advantages that the master gains when having that particular races
#as the given type. (here: Familiar). The following tags are then granted to the master.
#
#The ABILITY:FEAT|VIRTUAL| tag is holding a list of feats that the character gains as virtual feats. Virtual Feats are granted to the character
#regardless of the prerequisites.
