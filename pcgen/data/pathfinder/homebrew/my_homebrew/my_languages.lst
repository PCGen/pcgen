#insert your data here

#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > LST File Class > Lesson 10" to find
#out how the tags in the languages file work.
#
#
#
#
#
#####1st Example

#Halfling			TYPE:Spoken.Written.Read

#####
#
#####2nd Example

#Druidic			TYPE:Spoken.Written.Read.Druid.Secret	PREVARGTEQ:DruidicLanguage,1

#####
#
#Druidic and Halfling are language names. The name must be the first field on each line. Other LST files will reference a
#language by the name. Every language needs a name.
#
#The TYPE tag is used to set the type/group of the language. It may take multiple types delimited by periods. The types used
#are usually Spoken, Read, and Written. Every language should have at least one type.
#
#In the second Example the PREVARGTEQ tag is used to allow selection of the language only, if the character has the
#DruidicLanguage variable at a value of 1 or higher. The DruidicLanguage will only be set elsewhere, when a character becomes
#eligible to learn the language, for instance by acquiring the Druid class. There is a multitude of existing prerequiste tags
#in PCGen. If you are looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic
#"PRExxx tags".
