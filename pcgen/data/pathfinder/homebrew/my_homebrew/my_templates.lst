#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Template File tags to find
#out how the tags in the templates file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#Vampire is the name of the template. It will appear in the templates list on PCGen's Races tab and will be used if a template
#is added by use of the TEMPLATE tag. The name is the only entry that is mandatory in a template. The other tags are used
#as they are needed.
#
#The HITDIE tag can be used to specify the new Hit Dice size the template grants to the creature.
#
#The CR tag increases the Challenge Rating by the given amount.
#
#The DR tag defines the damage reduction this template bestows.
#
#The LEVELADJUSTMENT tag raises the Effective Character Level (ECL) of the creature by the number supplied, in this case 8.
#
#The TEMPLATE tag grants the supplied template to the character. In PCGen Templates are not only the templates as defined
#in the games, but we use them also as overlays when repetitive data applies to a group of creatures. In this case the Undead
#template applies the Undead traits to the character.
#
#TEMPLATE:CHOOSE will supply a popup window of the choices presented in the tag that are | (pipe) delimited (The user is allowed
#only ONE choice from the list). The given choices must be existing templates, or they will not be eligible. If only one
#choice is eligible, the TEMPLATE:CHOOSE tag will automatically select that one and no popup window will appear.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the template. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#The SA tag is holding a text that will be displayed as Special Ability on the output sheet. You can have variables displayed
#in it. In "SAB:Dominate (Su) DC%|VampireAbilityDC" the text after the | (pipe) is a variable name. It will replace the % (percent)
#sign and display the value of the VampireAbilityDC variable there.
#
#The DEFINE tag creates a new variable and sets its initial value.
#
#The PREALIGN tag is used, so it is required that you have a certain alignment to be able to select this template. There is a
#multitude of existing prerequiste tags in PCGen. If you are looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can
#find them listed under the topic "PRExxx tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are another group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a
#description of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC tag gives an Ability as a Feat to the character. You can grant multiple Feats by listing them seperated by the | (pipe)
#delimiter.
# Format is:
#	ABILITY:AbilityPool|AbilityNature|AbilityName1|AbilityName2
#
#The RACETYPE tag changes the race type of the creature. Each race in PCGen has a RACETYPE tag, when another RACETYPE tag is encounter
#(such as when a RACETYPE tag exists in a template) the characters race type changes to the newly applied RACETYPE, a character can have only one race type at a time.
#(RACETYPE is used internally by PCGen for matching up with Monster HD, and for references to race, such as the Rangers Favored Enemy.)
