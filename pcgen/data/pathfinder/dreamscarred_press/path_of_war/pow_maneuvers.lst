###Block: Maneuver and Stance long descriptions
# Spell Name						Description
Adamantine Fang.MOD					DESC:When initiating this maneuver, the disciple congeals the totality of his ki along his weapon which glitters almost like a diamond just before he strikes. The disciple makes an attack against an opponent, and if successful, the attack deals an additional 12d6 points of damage and bypasses all damage reduction the target may possess. The awesome force of the disciple's ki is so strong that it has the potential to paralyze the opponent on a failed Will save (DC 18 + primary initiator attribute modifier) for one round. This is a supernatural ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Adamantine Knuckle.MOD					DESC:The sheer ferocity and focus of the disciple's ability in the unarmed combat area rivals that of the ki wielders in the world. By tightening his knuckles, long since numb with scars and digging deep within, the disciple strikes with steel shattering force.

Aggravated Wounds.MOD					DESC:By making aggravating wounds and aggressive, intimidating postures, the disciple's attacks possess an unusual amount of threatening power.

Alacrity on Wing.MOD					DESC:With reflexes honed from many combats, the disciple may react to danger with speed so great he may even attack multiple times while he evades the unlucky attacker.

Alpha's Roar.MOD						DESC:With an awesome cry for victory and bravery from his allies, the Golden Lion disciple bolsters the defenses and attacks for a moment as his allies cannot help themselves but to win. Allies within 30 ft. of the disciple gain a +4 morale bonus to their savings throws and increase to the DC's of their abilities (maneuvers, spells, powers, etc) for one round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Altered Penumbra.MOD					DESC:Position is relative to the Veiled Moon disciple's thinking, and his position in the universe is mutable. Using these principles, the disciple may circumvent reality to remove himself from harms way when necessary. The initiator makes a Stealth check opposing the attacker's Perception check; if successful then the initiator may teleport to any spot within 10 ft. away from his current position and leave a minor image duplicate of himself behind to take the attack of his foe in his place. Minor images created by this counter last for 1d4 rounds or until dispersed. This ability may be used to defend against spells and effects that directly target the initiator with an attack roll (such as ranged touch effects) or for those that allow for a Reflex save. If the attack would still encompass an area to where the initiator is teleporting to (such as with the fireball spell), the initiator would still be struck by the attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anchoring Spirit.MOD					DESC:The Veiled Moon disciple pulls himself fully into the Ethereal and manifests a ghostly apparition of his form upon the Material, and in doing so he locks his immediate area for travel through the Ethereal or Astral plane.

If two or more disciples of Veiled Moon enter this stance within each other's radius of effect, the stance ceases to function while any amount of their affected area crosses. This is an Ethereal plane using maneuver.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ancient's Fang.MOD					DESC:With a powerful overhand throw, the Thrashing Dragon disciple hurls one of his blades into his foe's form with the force and power rivaling the snapping jaws of an ancient dragon.

Banish to the Beyond.MOD				DESC:The ultimate technique of the Veiled Moon disciple is the ability to lay a mark against a target and shunt him gently into the Astral plane where he may ponder his reasons for crossing the likes of a master.

Failure indicates that the target is shifted fully into the Astral plane, body and all, and the target may not return to the Material plane for one day per two initiator levels of the disciple (maximum of 10 days). If the foe has no way to return to the Material plane after this duration has expired, he is effectively stranded.

The initiator then makes an immediate sunder attempt with a +2 circumstance bonus on his foe's weapon (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity), and if the weapon is reduced to half of it's hit points, then it gains the broken condition and the disciple takes half damage from the attack.

This is a supernatural ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Doom Talon.MOD						DESC:When a potentially deadly strike occurs, the Thrashing Dragon disciple knows how to make the blow count. When the initiator makes an attack roll that scores a critical threat, as a swift action the initiator may automatically confirm this critical hit and inflict an additional 4d6 points of damage.

This strike inflicts an additional +4d6 points to the first target, +2d6 points of damage to the second, and normal damage to the third target. Each reflection attack is considered a separate attack for the purposes of determining the effectiveness of single attack boosting abilities, such as boosts that affect one attack or spells like true strike.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dragon Assault.MOD					DESC:By unleashing their full wrath against their enemies, a Thrashing Dragon disciple is capable of inflicting incredible powerful blows that get more potent per successive hit. The initiator makes a full round attack against a target(s), the first successful hit inflicting normal damage.

Eclipsing Moon.MOD					DESC:Folding space around his form effortlessly, the disciple is capable of leaps through the ether and attack through the barrier between the worlds in a series of staccato bursts of silvery-blue light and his blinking image as he strikes. As a full attack action, the initiator may make an attack against a target and then teleport a distance up to his movement speed to a new target to strike again, and each attack is made against the target's flat-footed armor class. He may do this a number of times equal to the number of attacks he possesses on a full attack action (including off hand attacks or secondary attacks), and he may select the same target for each attack but each teleportation must land him in position to make an attack against a target creature (he must attack a target creature at the end of each teleportation). Each attack gains a +2 competence bonus and inflicts an additional 4d4 points of force damage. If the target is fighting in a way that would grant more attacks than normal, such as with two-weapon fighting or natural weapons, the initiator may teleport between each attack until the initiator runs out of attacks to make, but secondary attacks (such as off-hand attacks or secondary natural attacks) only add 2d4 additional force damage to those strikes and gain the usual +2 competence bonus to the attack. The initiator may forgo the first attack of this maneuver to teleport himself into position to use the rest of the attacks of this maneuver.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The target of this counter immediately has twice the disciple's initiator level in hit points restored to his total.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enduring Shell.MOD					DESC:By tightening up behind his shield and dropping low under its protective aegis, the disciple of the Iron Tortoise learns to minimize the risk he suffers towards spells and effects that would cause him to rely solely on reflexes.

The initiator may add his total shield bonus to AC to a single Fortitude or Reflex save when using this counter.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enraging Strike.MOD					DESC:The defensive nature of the Iron Tortoise teaches the initiate to protect his allies, and to do so, he must focus the attentions of his foes on him.

Additionally, he gains a +2 morale bonus to attack the initiator of this strike due to the anger incited by the initiator.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Essence Shattering Strike.MOD				DESC:With a powerful strike, the Veiled Moon disciple attacks at the very spirit of his foe with his silver-blue light.

Ethereal Reminiscence.MOD				DESC:The ectoplasmic nature of beings on the Ethereal plane allows for the Veiled Moon disciple to briefly transport himself to that realm and use his will to restore some his form by filling his wounds with spectral energies, displacing his injuries but at a great potential risk. As a full round action, the initiator may become incorporeal for one round and restore twice his ranks in Stealth in hit points to himself. Every time the initiator makes the transition between planes, however, he runs the risk of potentially losing himself there briefly. The initiator initiating this maneuver must make a Will save (DC 18, +2 DC for every time he's initiated this maneuver since he last rested for 8 hours after the first use); if successful, the maneuver works as normal. If the saving through fails, the initiator does not regain any hit points, instead suffering 2d6 points of damage, and spends the next 2d4 rounds lost in the borderland between the Prime Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, and when he returns to the Prime, he is dazed for one round. This is an Ethereal plane using maneuver.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ether Wave.MOD						DESC:The Veiled Moon disciple concentrates his spiritual energies to his hand and tears into the barrier between the Astral and the Material, and releases the energies that form from this in a wracking wave of silvery-blue energy.

Fading Leap.MOD						DESC:With nary a thought and a gesture the Veiled Moon disciple may flow like moonlight from one location to another through the Astral plane, moving faster than his earthly body would allow. As a move action, the initiator may teleport to a location in range of twice the disciple's base movement speed away.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fading Strike.MOD						DESC:The disciple learns the basic technique at this level for walking between worlds to reach locations that previously could be inaccessible by the mortal world and potentially attack foes at those locales. As a standard action, the initiator may either teleport to a location no farther away than his maximum movement speed, and make an attack action against an opponent as part of the same standard action, or attack an adjacent target and then teleport to a location no farther away than his maximum movement speed. The teleportation destination must be clearly seen by the disciple to teleport to that location, and it must be unoccupied.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fangs Strike Low.MOD					DESC:By forcing an opponent's guard up, the Thrashing Dragon spins low and attacks at the legs of the target to reduce his mobility and cause deep, flensing wounds.

Feel the Wind.MOD						DESC:By studying the wind and air around him, the Solar Wind disciple learns to overcome his surrounding's difficulties when using ranged weapons and may fire true. The initiator may ignore environmental variables such as high winds and storm and rain that would cause the initiator to suffer penalties to his attack rolls, magically created (such as wall of wind or control weather or naturally caused such as in a gale force wind), when making ranged attacks for one round. This is a supernatural ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Final Blow.MOD						DESC:Mercy has a place on the battlefield, a disciple of Scarlet Throne understands, as does the benefit of an honorable and swift death. By showing his enemy a merciful, swift death in battle, the disciple may continue to his next victory while letting both keep their honor. The disciple makes a melee attack against an injured foe, and if the foe is under 25%% of his maximum hit points, the attack is treated as a coup de grace that is performed as part of that attack action instead of the normal a full round action usually required to perform such an action (without provoking attacks of opportunity). The attack does damage as a critical hit, and the foe must make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10 + the damage inflicted or die. If the foe is above 25%% of his maximum hit points, then this maneuver has no effect and normal damage is rolled. Disciples with this maneuver readied have keen senses in knowing where his enemy's strength stands, and may make a Sense Motive check as a free action (DC 20) to gauge if his opponent is capable of being finished by this maneuver.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Finishing Kick.MOD					DESC:Amidst the flurry of punches, kicks, and elbows that are the hallmarks of the Broken Blade discipline, the disciple who has put his foe through the ropes of learning what it is to underestimate the warrior without weapons may deliver this powerful kick to reduce his foe to a bleeding heap.

Five-Fold Hydra Sting.MOD				DESC:A true mastery of the discipline of Steel Serpent possesses the knowledge to use his own skill, ki, and knowledge of the systems of living creatures, putting them to use for ending of a life. When a disciple initiates this maneuver and strikes a foe, he shows his deadly intent and knowledge in show of terrible force by striking a foe's heart chakra and sends a cascade of poisonous ki through the body to annihilate the life-force of the target. The disciple makes an attack against a foe, if this is successful the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 19 + primary initiator attribute modifier). If this save fails, the target is instantly slain as his body's energies revolt and consume in a flash, reducing the body to ash (equipment is unharmed). If the target succeeds this save, his body still suffers from the experience, as the attack inflicts an additional 50 points of damage. If the target dies from this, his body also dissolves into ash. Victims slain by this attack cannot be resurrected normally; a wish or miracle spell must be cast first to restore the life-force of the victim's spirit before any raise attempt can be attempted. This is a supernatural ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flashing Ether Touch.MOD				DESC:With but a touch the Veiled Moon disciple may send a foe hurtling through the Astral to reappear with frightening velocity to hit the ground. The initiator makes a melee touch against a target, and the target makes a Will save (DC 17 + primary initiator attribute modifier modifier) or is teleported up to 60 ft. away, successful saving throw negating the maneuver. Upon a failed saving throw, the target suffers 10d6 points of damage from reaching high speeds and slamming hard into the ground. If teleported into the air, consider the initiator to have already have fallen 100ft. Effects like feather fall halve this damage if used, and targets who are immune to falling damage take no damage from this maneuver, and those who reduce falling damage by increments of 10 ft. may subtract 1d6 points of damage per 10 ft. they may reduce falls.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flash Kick.MOD						DESC:As part of a full attack action, the disciple may make a powerful and swift kick while his blades strike.

Flicker Strike.MOD					DESC:In a flickering blur of teleportation and movement, the Veiled Moon disciple may disappear, blink into existence to strike a foe, and then disappear again to appear a safe distance away. The initiator may teleport up to his movement speed to a target enemy, make an attack or a combat maneuver (such as disarm or trip) against the foe using his flat-footed armor class (denying the target his Dexterity bonus to his AC due to the surprising nature of the attack), then teleport away up to his movement speed, all without drawing attacks of opportunity on the movement or attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Lion Lord's Agony.MOD					DESC:With a fury born of desperation and determination for victory, the Golden Lion disciple pours his pain into his swings so that the enemy may drink deeply of it. The initiator makes a melee attack, and in lieu of the weapon's damage the attack instead inflicts a number of points of damage equal to the initiator's maximum hit points minus his current hit points (example, if the disciple has 200 maximum hit points and has been wounded down to 54 remaining hit points, this attack inflicts 146 points of damage).

Mithral Tortoise Stance.MOD				DESC:The Iron Tortoise disciple has become so comfortable in his armor that is like a second skin to him, and he is capable of moving better than most while wearing it.
