The stalker spends one point of ki as a swift action to read his target opponent, and may apply his deadly strike to all martial strikes initiated by the stalker for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier against this target [%1 rounds].

The stalker envisions potential scenarios where martial abilities he has not readied come into play and gains a momentary burst of martial insight. A number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier [%1/day], the stalker can spend one ki point as a swift action and trade one readied maneuver for another maneuver known of the same level or lower. The new maneuver is immediately readied and accessible for use. The character may initiate this maneuver and recover it as if he had prepared at the beginning of the day (or when ever the stalker readied his maneuvers last) until the end of the combat encounter.StalkerKiPoolTradeManeuverTimes|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Stalker ~ Ki Pool Trade Maneuver	DESC:The ki pool is replenished each day after 8 hours of rest and meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the stalker possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, stalker levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The stalker can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class he possesses that grants a ki pool.

The stalker's deadly strike activates whenever the stalker scores a successful critical hit against a target, and is active against that target for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier [%1 rounds]. Deadly strike inflicts extra damage, to only this target creature, on all of the stalker's attacks. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 for every four stalker levels thereafter. When the stalker scores a critical hit, this extra damage is not multiplied, it is simply added to the damage. If the stalker scores a successful critical hit during the time his deadly strike is active, the duration of this ability is extended by one round (no more than one extension can be made per round). Ranged attacks can count as deadly strikes only if the target is within 30 ft. Deadly strike is more effective with weapons with higher critical multipliers, such as scythes and battle axes. Weapons with a x3 critical multiplier inflict damage with deadly strikes using a d8 instead of a d6, and weapons with a critical multiplier of x4 use d10's. Damage multipliers higher than x4 use d10's for deadly strikes damage. Deadly strike may not be used with weapons that inflict non-lethal damage. The stalker must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Creatures immune to critical hits or precision damage cannot be targeted by a deadly strike. A stalker cannot deadly strike while attacking a creature who has concealment.|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDuration																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|StalkerDeadlyStrikeLVL|StalkerLVL	BONUS:VAR|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDuration|StalkerPrimeStatBonus	BONUS:VAR|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDice|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerDeadlyStrikeLVL,1|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerDeadlyStrike1	BONUS:VAR|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDice|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerDeadlyStrikeLVL,5|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerDeadlyStrike5	BONUS:VAR|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDice|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerDeadlyStrikeLVL,9|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerDeadlyStrike9	BONUS:VAR|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDice|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerDeadlyStrikeLVL,13|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerDeadlyStrike13	BONUS:VAR|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDice|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerDeadlyStrikeLVL,17|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerDeadlyStrike17	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	ASPECT:Name|Deadly Strike +%1d6|StalkerDeadlyStrikeDice

This insight performs as an intuitive alarm, alerting him of danger. Through his rigorous practice and learning to trust his instincts and intuition to an unearthly level, the senses of the stalker are unusually sharp.

This ability counts as if the character possessed the Critical Focus feat, and for the purposes of taking critical feats that the character qualifies for. The character may not select the Critical Focus feat once he has this ability, and should he have it before he gains this ability, he loses the Critical Focus feat and may select a critical feat in its place.|StalkerCombatInsightConfirmCriticalBonus|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Stalker ~ Combat Insight Confirm Critical Bonus	DESC:The stalker's insight allows him to funnel the ki of his foes into his form with his deadly attacks.

When the stalker is harmed by an attack, spell, or ability of an enemy, as an immediate action he may spend two ki points to initiate a martial strike that he has readied (with an initiation action of one standard action) in retaliation against that attack. He uses the range of the attacker's ability as the range of his strike, creating a phantom echo of himself with his ki (as with the phantom reach art) that rushes out and strikes his attacker if they are outside of the stalker's normal reach. Use of this ability expends his strike as normal, and the strike functions as normal otherwise.

Stalkers do not need to sleep or be well rested to ready their maneuvers; any time he spends 10 minutes in meditation, he can change his readied maneuvers. He may not ready any individual maneuver more than once. He begins an encounter with all readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he may have already used them since he chose them. When the stalker initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered, see below). Stalkers may recover their maneuvers in one of two ways. The stalker may either center his awareness of the combat momentarily as a standard action and recover %2 expended maneuver of his choice. Alternately, he may recover his Wisdom modifier in expended maneuvers (min of 2) [%3 maneuvers] as a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, centering his spirit completely to re-align his perceptions of the battle and change his place in it. When recovering his maneuvers as a full round action, he may move up to his base speed and adds a +4 insight bonus to his Armor Class as his ki defends his form while he re-centers himself. The next attack or martial strike he attempts after recovering his maneuvers adds his deadly strike's damage to the attack if successful.|StalkerManeuversReadied|StalkerStandardActionRecover|StalkerFullRoundActionRecover																																																																																																																																																																																																												BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|4	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,3|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied3	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,5|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied5	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,8|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied8	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,10|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied10	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,13|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied13	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,15|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied15	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,18|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied18	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:StalkerLVL,20|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.StalkerManeuverReadied20	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedOne|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,1	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedTwo|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,2	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedThree|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,3	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedFour|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,4	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedFive|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,5	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedSix|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,6	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedSeven|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,7	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedEight|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,8	BONUS:VAR|StalkerManeuversReadiedNine|StalkerManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:StalkerHighestManeuverLevel,9																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.5	ASPECT:CombatBonus|+4 insight bonus to AC when recovering maneuvers as a full-round action

She can choose a new maneuver of any level she likes, as long as she observes her restriction on the highest-level maneuvers she knows. The warder can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.

She readies her maneuvers by going over battle tactics, through weapon drills, or spending time meditating in prayer for 10 minutes. The maneuvers she chooses remain readied until she decides to repeat this again and change them. Any given maneuver may only be readied once. Warders do not need to sleep or be well rested to ready their maneuvers; any time they spend 10 minutes in practice or meditation, they can change their readied maneuvers. She begins an encounter with all readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times she may have already used them since she chose them. When the warder initiates a maneuver, she expends it for the current encounter, so each of her readied maneuver can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered). For a warder to recover expended maneuvers, she must take stock of her situation to plan for her next movement. By focusing entirely on a defensive position to prepare her next move, she is able to regain maneuvers expended to assist her to victory. By taking a full round action to plan her next move (activating her defensive focus class feature), she recovers a number of expended maneuvers equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2) [%2 maneuvers]. Alternately, she may take a brief pause in battle and recover %3 of her choosing by spending a standard action on her turn.|WarderManeuversReadied|WarderFullRoundRecover|WarderStandardActionRecover																																																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|3	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:WarderLVL,2|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.WarderManeuverReadied2	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:WarderLVL,5|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.WarderManeuverReadied5	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:WarderLVL,8|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.WarderManeuverReadied8	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:WarderLVL,11|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.WarderManeuverReadied11	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:WarderLVL,14|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.WarderManeuverReadied14	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:WarderLVL,17|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.WarderManeuverReadied17	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:WarderLVL,20|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.WarderManeuverReadied20	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedOne|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,1	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedTwo|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,2	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedThree|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,3	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedFour|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,4	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedFive|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,5	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedSix|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,6	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedSeven|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,7	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedEight|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,8	BONUS:VAR|WarderManeuversReadiedNine|WarderManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:WarderHighestManeuverLevel,9																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.11

By setting himself to danger, does his true skill shine, or so the motto of the warlord goes. A warlord selects %1 gambits as methods by which the warlord can recover expended maneuvers. Each gambit possesses three aspects-a risk, a rake, and a reward. Each gambit's risk describes an action that the warlord must undertake in order to attempt to recover an expended maneuver. The warlord begins a gambit as a swift action, effectively diving recklessly into the act he is attempting. The warlord then performs the action described in the gambit, and if he is successful, he regains maneuvers (see below). If he is not, he suffers the rake of the gambit and only regains a single maneuver of his choosing. While performing a gambit, the warlord may add his Charisma modifier [+%2] to the d20 check(s) to aid in accomplishing the gambit as a luck bonus. A warlord may attempt the actions of a gambit, but without declaring the attempt a gambit attempt by spending a swift action to do so, the character does not regain any maneuvers nor does he suffer a rake for failure. The character may initiate a maneuver while performing a gambit (if the maneuver helps him accomplish it) but he may not recover the maneuver used to achieve the gambit as part of the reward. A gambit's rake is the penalty that the warlord suffers if he attempts his gambit and fails, such as failing a trip attempt or failing to strike an opponent with a charge attack. Each gambit possesses a unique reward that the warlord enjoys for succeeding at that gambit. All gambits possess the same rake; the warlord only regains a single expended maneuver and suffers a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls for one round.

Tethering point lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the expended spell slot. If the target of this ability were to utilize an effect, power, or spell with the (Teleportation) type, the mage hunter may either attempt to make a Will save against the effect (as if he were making a saving throw to resist an effect cast upon him) to cause the target's attempt to flee to fail, or he may voluntarily go along for the ride and teleport with his quarry to the same location. The mage hunter does not count against any limit the teleportation effect might have, such as number of creatures or total weight teleported.

If the attack hits, the mage hunter may immediately make a dispel check with a caster level equal to his initiator level [CL %1] as if he cast a targeted greater dispel magic in addition to doing normal damage. Additionally, if the mage hunter chooses to, anyone within 10 ft. of the mage hunter (excluding the mage hunter) is also affected as if they were hit by an area dispel magic.

Shadow Blade				KEY:Umbral Blade ~ Shadow Blade			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UmbralBladeClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:The umbral blade's mind is permanently connected to the Plane of Shadow by his bond with the essence of a creature of darkness and fear. His soul is profoundly affected by this, and his pact with this force is bound to his very flesh. Whenever he wields a weapon from the associated weapon groups of the Veiled Moon discipline, as a swift action the blade may be changed and altered by his promise to this darkness, resulting in it becoming a blade of ephemeral shadow and writhing smoke (when wielding multiple weapons or using a double weapon, both weapons or both weapon ends are enveloped with this darkness when it is called as the same swift action). This supernatural shadow blade inflicts an additional 1d6 points of cold damage when used. In other aspects it functions as a traditional weapon. As the shadow blade is comprised of his soul's dark energies and the energies that he wields as a Veiled Moon disciple, he may add his initiation modifier to the weapon's damage in place of his Strength modifier, and may always use Weapon Finesse with his shadow blade due to its lightened weight from its ephemeral nature. This effect ends when the umbral blade is no longer wielding an enveloped weapon or at will (a thrown shadow blade weapon will retain its properties until after it has been thrown, discharging when it comes to rest).

The umbral blade may charge his shadow blade (be it a single weapon, double weapon, or paired weapons) with this power as a move action, and later when needed, he may release this power as a free action as part of an attack or martial strike. This hungry and chilling darkness inflicts cold damage, and Blade of Night's bonus cold damage is added to each attack that the character makes during the round it is activated on.

While in Embrace the Shadow stance, as the umbral blade's connection to the Shadow Plane intensifies so does the merits he receives. His vital processes become suspended partially, transmuting his blood into thick, shadowy fluid.

The umbral blade may use the Stealth skill to hide as a swift action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.151
One with the Dark				KEY:Umbral Blade ~ One with the Dark		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UmbralBladeClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:The umbral blade's bond to the Plane of Shadow is complete, as the shadow that he controls consumes him, reshaping him as a being of that world. The shadowy, alien force that has been intruding into his own mind has formed an understanding at last, and the danger to the umbral blade's sanity is gone. The character's type changes to Outsider (native), and he gains the benefits of being in his Embrace the Shadow stance at all times (he loses Embrace the Shadows as a stance and gains its abilities and his shadow consumption abilities as racial traits instead, without fear of sanity loss).

Some describe the pain experienced as being the worst that any could endure, like something was inside their very spirit and devouring it whole. When making an attack or initiating a martial maneuver against his Claimed target, the soul hunter may force this subtle disharmony to become a geyser of agony, as the soul hunter's ki causes the target's life energies to ignite. This inflicts an additional %1d6 points of damage. Stalker arts that utilize deadly strikes use soulburning instead, and function as written with the following caveat: Soulburning cannot be done against targets that do not have vital forces (this includes constructs, oozes, and undead with an Intelligence score of 0.)|SoulHunterSoulburningDice																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		BONUS:VAR|SoulHunterSoulburningDice|floor((StalkerLVL+3)/4)																								SOURCEPAGE:p.127
