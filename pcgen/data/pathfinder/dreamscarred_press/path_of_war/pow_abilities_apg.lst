Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a cleric, a judge must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact he can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. A judge can select one domain from among those belonging to his deity. He can select an alignment domain only if his alignment matches that domain. With the GM's approval, a judge can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent his personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies. Judges also have access to Inquisitions, which are similar to Domains but do not include Domain spells. If he so chooses, he may use an inquisition instead of a domain. Each domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the judge. A judge does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does he gain bonus spell slots. The judge uses his level as his effective cleric level when determining the power and effect of his domain powers. If the judge has access to domains as a cleric or inquisitor, at least one of his domain selections must be the same domain selected as a judge; if he has an inquisition instead of a domain, he may choose two domains as normal. Levels of cleric and judge stack for the purpose of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus spells or for inquisitions unless the inquisition is taken in the place of a domain for the non martial disciple class.

By spending a point of ki as a standard action and clearly viewing a subject within close range, the judge gains the effects of a discern lies spell for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier.

When initiating a martial strike while using a judgment, the judge may expend a point of ki from his ki pool to strip away the magical protections of his foe. This functions as a targeted greater dispel magic using his initiator level as his caster level [CL %1], and this targets spells or spell-like abilities functioning on a target (with a duration of one round or longer), and may target a number of ongoing effects equal to his Wisdom modifier [%2 effects].|JudgeDivineAbolishmentCL|JudgeDivineAbolishmentTargets																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|JudgeDivineAbolishmentCL|StalkerInitiatorLVL	BONUS:VAR|JudgeDivineAbolishmentTargets|StalkerPrimeStatBonus				SOURCEPAGE:p.126

To attempt to levy final judgment on a target, the judge must first study his target for three full rounds before making the final judgment. On the following round, if the judge initiates a maneuver against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the maneuver has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the judge as an enemy. If the attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the judge's level + the judge's Wisdom modifier [DC %1]. If the save is successful, the target still suffers the effects of the maneuver as normal, but it is immune to that judge's final judgment ability for 1 day.|JudgeFinalJudgmentDC	BONUS:VAR|JudgeFinalJudgmentDC|10+floor(StalkerLVL/2)+StalkerPrimeStatBonus	SOURCEPAGE:p.126
