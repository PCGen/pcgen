DESC:Judgments are special supernatural bonuses an inquisitor can call upon a limited number of times per day. They are the unique element of the class, and serve as the main thing that keeps an inquisitor from being a cleric with fewer spells. It would makes sense, then, if the inquisitor had access to a large list of judgments from which a player could customize and focus the character. Alas, a lack of space makes a long list of judgments impractical in the Advanced Player's Guide (especially given that the inquisitor already has new spells and teamwork feats that take up considerable room). To broaden the utility of judgments, Advanced Options: Inquisitors' Judgments present several new judgments, a judgment-heavy alternative inquisitor class, and a few new judgment-focused feats.
