Your skin turns a fiery red color and you gain fast healing 3, although this ability cannot repair damage caused by acid or fire. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when you fail a Will saving throw; if you do, you can reroll your saving throw, but you must take the second result.
Opportunistic Loyalty		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Cleric,Inquisitor,Witch=1					SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 immediate action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature					DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.67											DESC:Cast this spell when a creature within range casts a spell that provides an effect for its allies (such as bless or prayer). You are considered an ally of the caster for the purposes of that spell. Although you are momentarily considered an ally, the caster need not target you if the spell requires that the caster select one or more allies to be affected by the spell (as does haste). This spell does not allow a target spell to affect more creatures than described in its target entry. If this spell would raise the total number of affected targets above that allowed by the target spell, opportunistic loyalty has no effect.
