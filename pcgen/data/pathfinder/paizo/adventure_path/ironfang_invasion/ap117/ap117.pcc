DESC:Longshadow, a wealthy refinery town, now faces the perils of war. If the Ironfang Legion seizes the walled settlement, its grip will tighten across all of Nirmathas, and the local mines and refineries will grant it enough raw materials to fuel its engine of war indefinitely. But the Legion's heavy focus on Longshadow leaves its flanks vulnerable to a campaign of sabotage and harassment! Can the PCs end the hobgoblin siege, and in the process discover the secret behind the Ironfang Legion's lightning-quick raids and unseen troop movements?
