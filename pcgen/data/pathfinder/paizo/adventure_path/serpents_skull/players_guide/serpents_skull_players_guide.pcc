#DESC:The Serpent's Skull Player's Guide is intended to provide context for creating characters from the nation of Brevoy or surrounding regions who wish to play a role in the Stolen Lands' transformation. In this campaign, your characters will explore vast wildernesses and settle them, build cities and nations, and even fight wars against opposing kingdoms. Many of these unusual campaign elements are supported by additional rules that appear in other volumes of the Serpent's Skull Adventure Path-your GM can provide you with the information you need to explore, build, conquer, and war as the need arises in each adventure. As a special preview, some of these elements are presented at the end of this guide so you have all of the blank forms and hex paper you need to track your adventures and achievements in the Stolen Lands.
DESC:This guide seeks to aid players preparing to take part in the Serpent's Skull Adventure Path, to arm them with spoiler-free details and rules elements useful in the forthcoming challenges, and to help create backgrounds that easily mesh with the campaign. Along with advice for players of every race and character class in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game - including those in the newly released Advanced Player's Guide - details on Sargava, the country in closest proximity to the campaign's events, and of the Jenivere, the ship conveying the PCs to adventure, should help ground players in the circumstances and events of this new Adventure Path. Those looking for even more details and options for exotic adventures should take a look at Pathfinder Player's Companion: Sargava.
