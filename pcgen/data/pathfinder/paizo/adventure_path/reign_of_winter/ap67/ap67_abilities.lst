Sticky Resin	KEY:Frost Fir ~ Sticky Resin	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DEFINE:StickyResinDC|0	DESC:A frost fir's bark constantly exudes a sticky resin that aids its combat maneuvers and  natural attacks. The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must succeed at a DC %1 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is Constitution-based.|StickyResinDC	BONUS:VAR|CMB_Disarm,CMB_Grapple,CMB_Steal|2	BONUS:VAR|StickyResinDC|10+(HD/2)+CON	SOURCEPAGE:p.84

Apportation					KEY:Witchcrow ~ Apportation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																		DESC:In large enough groupings (such as a murder), greater witchcrows can perform a cooperative form of magic once per day to open a glowing ring in one place leading to somewhere else on the planet. This always entails a raucous aerial ritual, usually centered on those that wish to make use of this ability. The ritual functions like a teleportation circle (CL 17th), except it requires 1 minute of uninterrupted casting time, the circle doesn't need to  be placed on a horizontal surface, and it is not invisible or hard to detect. After coming into existence, the edges of the circle glow and the effect stays in place for 1 minute. Most witchcrows loathe using this power, but some offer it as a service to those in need of quick travel, demanding a high price for such assistance--usually something in the bargainer's possession that is cherished, extremely valuable, and almost always magical.
