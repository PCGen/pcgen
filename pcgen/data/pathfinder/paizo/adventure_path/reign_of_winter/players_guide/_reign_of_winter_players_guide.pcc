DESC:The Reign of Winter Player's Guide gives players all the spoiler-free information, inspiration, and new rules they'll need to create characters prepared for delving into the adventure and frigid mysteries of the Reign of Winter Adventure Path. Within, players of this campaign will find everything they need to create character backgrounds tied to personalities and events vital to Pathfinder Adventure Path's fight to turn back the tide of unseasonable pockets of winter popping up all over Golarion. Inside players find campaign-specific traits to give adventurers the edge they need to take on cruel witches, evil fey, and frigid threats encountered amid the snow and ice. This player's guide also features a brief survey of Heldren, a small village in southern Taldor where the excitement begins, as well as various class options for heroes ready to take up the call to end the Reign of Winter!
