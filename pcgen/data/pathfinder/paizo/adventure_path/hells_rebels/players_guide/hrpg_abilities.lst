Child of Kintargo			KEY:Trait ~ Child of Kintargo			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Child of Kintargo],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]						DESC:You had the fortune (or perhaps the misfortune, depending on your viewpoint) to be born into one of Kintargo's noble families. Your experience growing up among the city's well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the new situation in Kintargo brewing, there is much concern about an eventual restructuring of the city's nobility. Already, one noble estate has burned to the ground under what can best be described as suspicious circumstances, but whether the government or rebels were responsible depends on whom you ask. With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in the Greens. If you want to be a member of one of Kintargo's major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is always a class skill for you. The Noble Scion feat (see the sidebar on page 11) does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. In addition, you start play with a noble's outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. If you take the Noble Scion feat, your last name is probably Aulamaxa, Aulorian, Delronge, Jarvis, Jhaltero, Sarini, Tanessen, or Vashnarstill; if you're not human, you were adopted into the family. If you don't take this feat, you can make up your last name.

While you likely agree with most others of Kintargo that many of the laws put in place by House Thrune seem excessive, you always respected the law and honored it as best you could. You likely worship a deity such as Abadar or Iomedae -a lawful neutral or perhaps lawful good power allowed to practice within Cheliax, but only under restrictions. Yet despite this, Thrune has always made Cheliax a safer place to live. But with recent events, enough is enough. As much as it pains you to admit, the law of the land is now manifestly and obviously not correct, and something must be done to oppose this misuse of power. You're good at hiding your true colors and faith to avoid attracting the wrong kind of attention. You gain a +1 bonus on Disguise checks, and Disguise is always a class skill for you. In addition, when someone uses detect good or detect law on you, your effective Hit Dice are 4 lower than their actual total when someone discerns the strength of your aura. If you are a cleric, paladin, or similar divine spellcaster, you treat yourself as if you were a standard- aligned creature rather than a divine spellcaster for these purposes. This means that until you become 9th level, you won't radiate an aura of good or law at all when someone casts one of these detection spells. Finally, your internal convictions that you're on the actual right of law help bolster your mindset, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											BONUS:SKILL|Disguise|1|TYPE=Trait															SOURCEPAGE:p.10	ASPECT:SaveBonus|+1 trait bonus vs. mind-affecting

You're hardly a superstar among the performers who've graced the stage there, but you have performed several times before in small parts. Just recently, you got your big break-you'd won a role in the infamous opera Huntress of Heroes, and had been studying for the role furiously before the onset of martial law dashed your plans to the dirt. Now that the Kintargo Opera House has been claimed by Barzillai Thrune, all shows have been canceled and your chance at success seems to have been lost. Yet you can't lose hope. You still practice your skills, and some day, perhaps the Kintargo Opera House will open its doors again, at which point you intend to be center stage! Choose one type of Perform skill. You gain a +1 trait bonus in that specific Perform skill, and all Perform skills are class skills for you. You also increase the save DCs of all language-dependent spells and effects you create by 1.

Perhaps your family was asked to give up something dear as a sacrifice, such as the life of a newly born brother or sister. Maybe the church used your family as a scapegoat to cover up a crime someone higher in the church committed. Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth-that Asmodeus does not care for his followers, and that the deity of your new religion does. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was punished; they were either put in prison, exiled from Kintargo, or perhaps even executed. Ever since, you've vowed to some day get revenge against the church. Choose one: you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls or you gain a +1 trait bonus on the save DCs of your spells against agents of House Thrune and worshipers of Asmodeus, including most (but not all) devils.

Perhaps your parents or older siblings were singers at the Kintargo Opera House, or maybe you simply had to make ends meet as an orphan of the streets by busking. Whatever the case, you've long been exposed to the practice of cloaking scathing political commentaries in the form of harmless entertainment. Whether you conceal your satire in the form of novels, plays, screeds, or public letters, you've yet to make a name for yourself as a political presence in Kintargo-but in time, you hope to change that! You gain a +1 trait bonus on Linguistics checks, and Linguistics is always a class skill for you. In addition, your irreverent attitude grants you a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against fear effects.

Historian of the Rebellion	KEY:Trait ~ Historian of the Rebellion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Gifted Satirist],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]						DESC:You've long been interested in the legacy of the Silver Ravens-a group of freedom fighters that rose to prominence in Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War. There's frustratingly little information today about the group, and you suspect that most of what was recorded about the Silver Ravens has long since been redacted or destroyed by government agents, but you've managed to pick up a tidbit here and there. Most of your knowledge isn't so much about the Silver Ravens specifically, but more about general histories of rebel groups and freedom fighters who have fought against oppressive governments throughout history, both in Cheliax and beyond. Your familiarity with rebel groups allows you to grant a +2 bonus on an Organization check of your choice once the party reestablishes the Silver Ravens during the first adventure. You can change which check you assign this bonus to once at the start of the rebellion's Upkeep phase. Your time preparing for joining the Silver Ravens has also honed your skill at remaining unseen. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks, and Stealth is always a class skill for you.

It might be unclear to you why this is the case, or you might deliberately seek out such positions, knowing you can organize any group to be something greater than the sum of its parts, but your knack for managing groups has always pushed you to the front of any operation you've found yourself a part of. You excel in the role of manager. You treat your Charisma score as if it were 14 (or 2 points higher than its actual score if your actual Charisma is already 14 or higher) for the purposes of determining how many teams you can manage in the rebellion, and for the purposes of determining the bonus you add to your managed teams' actions. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your Leadership score if you take the Leadership feat.

Pattern Seeker			KEY:Trait ~ Pattern Seeker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CampaignTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trait ~ Pattern Seeker],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]						DESC:There are patterns in the world, both natural and artificial, that if only one can interpret them correctly, great secrets could be divined. You have long been fascinated by the idea of these hidden patterns, perhaps because a sibling or parent went to the grave obsessed with seeking a pattern, or maybe because you feel that you've uncovered a previously unknown pattern. Kintargo has a particularly unique pattern of its own; the belfry atop the Temple of Asmodeus rings at what seem to be random intervals. None know who or what rings the bells, and no true pattern by which the so-called Devil's Bells has yet accurately predicted the tolling. Many have tried, and extensive but always incomplete documents exist that track the dates and times of recorded ringings back to the end of the Chelish Civil War, when the church of Asmodeus first claimed the abandoned temple of Aroden as their own. Maybe you will be the one to solve the pattern of the Devil's Bells? You gain a +1 trait bonus on all Perception checks, and Perception is always a class skill for you. In addition, you increase the save DC of any illusion (pattern) spell you cast by 1, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against illusion effects.

There are so many to choose from, and they're all so glamorous, rich, and successful! Wouldn't it be amazing to, perhaps some day, meet one of them? Or even better, to be a Kintargan celebrity yourself? Your interest in one of Kintargo's celebrities could be completely benign, with the NPC acting as a muse, inspiration, or role model for you that you used to guide many life choices leading you to this day. Or perhaps your interest is more akin to an obsession, in which you hope to some day live a life like that you imagine your idol lives, or perhaps even to some day meet and become friends (or perhaps more than friends) with your idol. Keep in mind, though, that sometimes a celebrity's public persona and real personality are two very different things, and if some day you were to meet your idol, you might be surprised at the truth! That said, the fact that, by all accounts, your idol has been missing since House Thrune instituted martial law has you worried; you hope he or she is all right! The fact that all five of the local legends listed below have been rumored to have ties to the Silver Ravens further concerns you, considering how that group seems to have been particularly targeted by Barzillai Thrune's agents over the past week. The fate of all five of these Kintargan icons will be revealed at some point during the Hell's Rebels Adventure Path, but keep in mind that some of those fates might not be pleasant discoveries for you! You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. Pick one of the following celebrities with which to be obsessed. Each celebrity is associated with a particular ability score. Once per day, you can draw on your inspiration from your icon when you are about to attempt a skill check modified by that ability score. When you do so, roll the check twice and take the better of the two results as your actual result. Jackdaw (sex and race unknown; Intelligence): A notorious folk hero or heroine (no one seems to know if Jackdaw is a man or woman) who helped defend Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, and whom many believe still lives on today in the city's shadows. Jilia Bainilus (female human; Wisdom): Kintargo's previous lord-mayor was well known for her cutting insights into the political world. Few have fought harder to maintain Kintargo's independence. Octavio Sabinus (male human; Strength): The Lictor of the Hellknight Order of the Torrent might seem an odd choice for admiration, but Octavio's physical stature certainly lent him all the support he needed to command a room. Shensen (female half-elf; Charisma): Shensen's performances as an outspoken force against the diabolism of House Thrune have won her nearly as many admirers as have her memorable performances on stage in the Kintargo Opera House. Strea Vestori (female tiefling; Dexterity): Strea is often regarded as the face of the slums known as the Devil's Nursery. As Kintargo's most outspoken and public tiefling citizen and leader of the Cloven Hoof Society, she has nearly as many admirers as she has political enemies in Cheliax.

You know because you've made a point of seeking out those secrets. Local urban legends and bits of strange historical rumors have long fascinated you-who knows what amazing truths about Kintargo's past have been lost forever to the redactors of House Thrune? What caused Professor Mangvhune of the Alabaster Academy to become the city's most infamous serial killer? Who were the dragons Adrakash, Ithanothaur, and Rivozair, and what were their ties to Kintargo? Why do the Devil's Bells of the Temple of Asmodeus seem to ring at random times, and is there a pattern to the peals? Who were the Silver Ravens who defended Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, and why did they vanish so soon after that war's resolution? So many mysteries, and who better than you to find the answers? Pick one of the questions above as your focus. Answers to these questions can be discovered at different points during Hell's Rebels, but don't expect to learn these answers any time soon! More important, your choice of focus grants you a +1 trait bonus in a particular Knowledge skill check associated with that focus (pick one of the two options provided below for your question). That Knowledge skill is always a class skill for you. Once per day, when you attempt a Knowledge skill check in either of the types associated with your focus, you can roll twice and take the better result as your actual result.

Rebellion Rank 17	SORTKEY:Boon_Rebellion Rank 17	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GM_Award.SpecialQuality											DESC:Training: At rank 2, then again at ranks 7, 12, and 17, each PC gains a bonus skill rank that can be immediately applied to any skill. This represents training the PC has gained through association with the increasing number of skilled workers and rebels who have joined the cause. This bonus skill rank can be applied to any skill, as if it were a bonus rank gained by earning a level in a favored class. It stacks with all other sources of skill ranks, but a character's maximum rank in any skill remains unchanged; the PC can never have more ranks in any one skill than he or she has Hit Dice. Subsequent training bonuses can be applied to the same skill or a different skill, as the PC wishes.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SKILL|TYPE=Base													BONUS:SKILLRANK|%LIST|1	COST:0
