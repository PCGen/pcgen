DESC:The heroes return to Korvosa to find their home city in a stranglehold of martial law and cruelty--and that Queen Ileosa has neared her goal of achieving immortality. With the holy weapon Serithtial in their hands, they must confront old enemies and explore ancient Thassilonian ruins if they hope to save the people of Korvosa from fueling a mad queen's lust for immortality.
