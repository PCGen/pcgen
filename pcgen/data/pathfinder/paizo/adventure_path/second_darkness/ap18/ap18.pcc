DESC:The Second Darkness Adventure Path comes to its explosive conclusion as the heroes travel into a forgotten world hidden deep underground--the Land of Black Blood. There, they must contend with the region's monstrous guardians and defeat the drow who would use ancient magic to call down a star from the sky to destroy their enemies on the world above.
