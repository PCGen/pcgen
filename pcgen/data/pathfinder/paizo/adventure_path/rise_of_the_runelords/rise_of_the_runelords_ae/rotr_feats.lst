Lamashtu's Mark	NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PRESTAT:1,CON=13	PRETEXT:Lamashtu as patron deity.	DESC:You are marked as one of Lamashtu's favored minions.	SOURCEPAGE:p.419	BENEFIT:Your abdomen bears several ugly scars, as if your belly had been torn open by a clawed hand. Lamashtu's Mark identifies you as favored worshiper of the Mother of Monsters, and if it is visible, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks but a -2 penalty on Diplomacy checks. Once per day as a free action, you may invoke Lamashtu's name as you strike a nonevil foe with any melee attack. As you do, you cause the creature struck to become temporarily deformed in some hideous manner. C ommon deformities caused by this attack include cloven hoove s , horns , forked tongue s , ve stigial limb s like wings and tails, organs inexplicably forming on the outside ofthe skin, additional (and useless) eye s , and skin that hardens into pus -weeping plates. The deformity reduces the target's Charisma s core by 1d4 p oints for 1 hour; the target can resist this effect by making a Fortitude save (D C 10 + your character level + your Charisma modifier). The physical deformity vanishes as soon as the Charisma penalty fades. In addition, any offspring you sire or give birth to gain the fiendish template.
