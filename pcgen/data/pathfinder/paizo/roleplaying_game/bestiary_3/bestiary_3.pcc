DESC:Test your courage against the most infamous foes of myth and legend. Bestiary 3 presents hundreds of monsters for use in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Within this book you will find demiliches and demodands, grave knights and goblin snakes, norns and nephilim, imperial dragons and unfettered eidolons, and so much more. Yet not every creature needs to be an enemy, as winged garudas, crafty tanukis, and leonine lammasus all wait to join your party and answer the call of glory.
