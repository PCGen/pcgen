#Abaia
Eldritch Gizzard					KEY:Abaia ~ Eldritch Gizzard					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:An abaia can activate arcane spell trigger items as if it were a 14th-level sorcerer. It can store items in a special compartment within its stomach and activate them as if it were holding them. It can swallow or regurgitate an item as a standard action.
Endless Coils					KEY:Abaia ~ Endless Coils					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:As a full-round action, an abaia can attempt a single combat maneuver check to grapple up to two Large or four Medium or smaller creatures within its reach. Any targets successfully grabbed take constrict damage. The abaia only needs to succeed at one grapple check to maintain a grapple against multiple opponents.
Wave Rider						KEY:Abaia ~ Wave Rider						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:An abaia moving onto land brings a sheath of water with it, allowing it to swim on land. Its swim speed drops by 10 feet at the start of its turn if it is out of the water, and the sheath dissipates entirely when the abaia's swim speed reaches 20 feet. An abaia wave riding on land retains its spell resistance but loses its bonus to Stealth.
Spell Resistance					KEY:Abaia ~ Spell Resistance					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:An abaia has SR 21 only while in water.

#Almiraj
Hex-Prone						KEY:Almiraj ~ Hex-Prone						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:An almiraj takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against harmful witch hexes. The duration of any beneficial hexes longer than 1 round that affect an almiraj is increased by 50%%.
Magic Horn						KEY:Almiraj ~ Magic Horn					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:While on the creature's head, an almiraj's horn is treated as a +1 weapon. Any living creature slain by an almiraj's gore attack immediately turns to stone (as if by the flesh to stone spell, with no saving throw, and the creature is still dead). A severed almiraj horn retains a wisp of its former magic, and counts as a masterwork weapon if used to create a magical dagger or similar small piercing weapon.

#Alpluachra
Implant						KEY:Alpluachra ~ Implant					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:As a full-round action, an alpluachra can crawl into the mouth of a helpless creature (no more than three size categories larger than itself) and implant itself into the creature's throat. Once implanted, anything that the creature ingests is instead consumed by the alpluachra, including such substances as elixirs and potions or ingested alchemical items, diseases, drugs, or poisons. Once the alpluachra is implanted, the host creature begins suffering the effects of starvation and thirst (Core Rulebook p.444 ). Due in part to its numbing slime, an implanted alpluachra is difficult to detect. Each time the host creature ingests anything, it gains an automatic Perception check against the alpluachra's Stealth. After the newtlike fey is detected, it can be removed either by consuming at least half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water, by a remove disease spell cast on the host creature, or by treating the host with a successful DC 15 Heal check. When a Heal check made for this purpose fails by 5 or more, the host creature takes 1d6 points of damage. If the host attempts to remove the alpluachra by eating salt or drinking salt water, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d8 hours from the reaction with the alpluachra. If the alpluachra dies or becomes unconscious, it is immediately detected by the host creature, and can be removed safely as a full-round action. While implanted, an alpluachra is considered helpless.
Numbing Slime					KEY:Alpluachra ~ Numbing Slime				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Any creature that deals damage to an alpluachra with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, comes into contact with an alpluachra, or is host to an alpluachra must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty on all tactile Perception checks, as well as other skill checks requiring tactile senses (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand) for 24 hours. A host creature that fails this saving throw takes the penalty to detect the alpluachra implanted inside it. If the host creature succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be affected by the same alpluachra's numbing slime for another 24 hours.
Vulnerable to Salt				KEY:Alpluachra ~ Vulnerable to Salt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water poured over an alpluachra or consumed by a creature an alpluachra has implanted itself in deals 1d3 points of damage to the alpluachra.

#Ankou
Cold Iron Killer					KEY:Ankou ~ Cold Iron Killer					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:All of an ankou's natural weapons are treated as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Shadow Doubles					KEY:Ankou ~ Shadow Doubles					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Once per day as a free action, an ankou can conjure up to four shadowy duplicates, which appear anywhere within 60 feet of the ankou and last a number of rounds equal to the ankou's Charisma modifier (typically 7 rounds). These shadow doubles are identical to the original in all respects except that when conjured they have a number of hit points equal to 20%% of the true ankou's total hit points (26 hit points if conjured by an ankou with full hit points). The doubles have all of the true ankou's melee attacks and abilities, except they can't create more shadow doubles or use the ankou's spell-like abilities except for deeper darkness. Any creature that interacts with a shadow double can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the duplicate (DC 10 + 1/2 the ankou's Hit Dice + the ankou's Charisma modifier, typically DC 24). Against a creature that recognizes a shadow double for what it is, the double functions as a shadow conjuration (Core Rulebook p.340). Shadow doubles take double damage from spells with the light descriptor. If the true ankou is slain, is rendered unconscious, or is ever more than 120 feet from a shadow double, the duplicates instantly vanish.

#Aoandon
Touch of Madness					KEY:Aoandon ~ Touch of Madness				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:The touch of an aoandon causes maddening fear. As a standard action it can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals 10d6 damage. Any living creature damaged by an aoandon's touch attack must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw can't be confused again by this aoandon's touch of madness for 10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#Apocalypse Locust
Abyssal Torment					KEY:Apocalypse Locust ~ Abyssal Torment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:An apocalypse locust's sting is designed to torment its victims with wracking pain. A victim of the creature's venomous sting also takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. The effects of abyssal torment last until the sling's poison is cured.
Accursed Brand					KEY:Apocalypse Locust ~ Accursed Brand			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Whenever a victim fails its save against an apocalypse locust's breath weapon, the unholy fire burns an accursed brand into his flesh. For the next 24 hours, the branded victim is subjected to auditory hallucinations of foul desires and sinful deeds. The hallucinations cause lawful and good victims to become tainted; good-aligned clerics, druids, paladins, and even lawful monks are treated as though they've temporarily broken their codes of conduct. Any character marked by the accursed brand who has a class that's restricted to a good alignment or lawful alignment is treated as an ex-member of that class for 24 hours; an  atonement spell can end this effect.
Maddening Buzz					KEY:Apocalypse Locust ~ Maddening Buzz			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:When three or more apocalypse locusts in a group simultaneously flap their wings, they create a loud buzzing sound capable of driving other creatures mad. Any creature within a range of 100 feet + 10 additional feet per locust must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or go mad as if affected by a confusion spell (caster level equal to the locusts' CR plus the number of locusts present). This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The DC for the save is Charisma-based.
Sting							KEY:Apocalypse Locust ~ Sting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Poison-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Con plus abyssal torment; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Argus Vulnerabilities				KEY:Argus ~ Argus Vulnerabilities				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:An argus takes a -4 racial penalty on all saving throws against fascination and sleep effects.
Eye Gouge						KEY:Argus ~ Eye Gouge						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:If an argus rends or pins an opponent, as a swift action it can attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind the target. If its combat maneuver check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the opponent is permanently blinded.
Fascinating Gaze					KEY:Argus ~ Fascinating Gaze					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:A creature within 40 feet of an argus must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or be fascinated for 5d6 rounds. If the creature has 4 or fewer Hit Dice, it is instead dazed for 5d6 rounds. An argus can't use this ability in the same round it uses frightful presence. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Limitless Vision					KEY:Argus ~ Limitless Vision					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Senses						DESC:An argus takes no distance penalties on Perception checks.

#Astral Leviathan
Astral Locating					KEY:Astral Leviathan ~ Astral Locating			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Senses						DESC:An astral leviathan automatically knows the distance and direction to any place on the Astral Plane it has ever visited. Once per day it can use this ability to determine the location of a creature on the Astral Plane (as if using  locate creature  with unlimited range).
Gulping Tide					KEY:Astral Leviathan ~ Gulping Tide				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:An astral leviathan can create a 60-foot cone of roiling astral material, pulling all Large or smaller creatures and objects into its mouth so it can swallow them. Any creature in the area that succeeds at a DC 30 Fortitude save moves up to 60 feet toward the cone's origin; creatures that fail are swallowed. The leviathan can use this ability only once per minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Bakekujira
Leviathan's Call					KEY:Bakekujira ~ Leviathan's Call				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:The tone of a bakekujira's eerie song varies from that of a wistful memory to a burning hatred. As a standard action, a bakekujira can sing. Living creatures within a 120-foot radius of a singing bakekujira must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or become fascinated or frightened (bakekujira's choice) for 1 round. Any creature that succeeds at this save cannot be affected by the same bakekujira's leviathan's call ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Resonant Song					KEY:Bakekujira ~ Resonant Song				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, the bakekujira can release a damaging resonance, dealing 12d8 points of sonic damage to creatures in a 60-foot cone (Fortitude DC 28 for half).

Any Huge or smaller creatures in the bakekujira's space must succeed at a DC %1 Reflex save or take 4d8+24 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest empty square adjacent to the bakekujira. Humanoid creatures killed by this ability rise as draugr (Bestiary 2 p.110) in 1d6 hours. A bakekujira can use its capsize special attack in conjunction with this ability.|CHA+22
Undead Parasites					KEY:Bakekujira ~ Undead Parasites				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A 30-foot-radius cloud of undead fish and sea birds surrounds a bakekujira. Creatures starting their turn within the cloud must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be nauseated for 1 round and take 6d6 points of damage. Creatures with the ability to channel positive energy can suppress this aura for 1 round by expending one use of channel energy. The bakekujira receives a Will save against this effect. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the channeler's caster level + the channeler's Charisma modifier. The channeled energy has no other effect.

#Barometz - No specialized abilities

#Beheaded
Base Beheaded					KEY:Beheaded ~ Base						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality									DESC:A neutral evil spellcaster can gain a beheaded as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A beheaded familiar loses the mindless trait and has an Intelligence score appropriate for its master's level. A variant beheaded counts as an additional Hit Die toward the maximum Hit Dice of controlled undead.
Belching						KEY:Beheaded ~ Belching						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Beheaded Belching Type|1
Flaming						KEY:Beheaded ~ Flaming						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:The beheaded gains fire immunity and a +2 bonus to Charisma. Its slam attack also deals 1d6 points of fire damage and might catch the target on fire (Core Rulebook p.444)

Whether or not the save is successful, any creature in the area can't be affected by that beheaded's scream for the next 24 hours.
Swarming						KEY:Beheaded ~ Swarming						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:The beheaded gains 1 additional Hit Die, the swarm subtype, swarm immunities, and the distraction special ability. It loses its slam attack but gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This counts as two abilities for the purpose of determining the beheaded's CR.

Any creature within this area must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The slime transforms the area it coats into difficult terrain. Furthermore, any creature that is in the area (or that attempts to enter the area) must succeed at a DC 29 Reflex save or be entangled by the slime.

Immune to Magical Control			KEY:Bhole ~ Immune to Magical Control			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A bhole is immune to nearly all forms of mind control, including all charm,  suggestion, and dominate spells. It is similarly immune to  magic jar  and possession attempts.  Confusion  and other mind-affecting effects that don't allow another creature to directly control a bhole work normally. Rare effects that allow a creature to manipulate the exact effects of  confusion  on a creature provide one of the few ways to magically control a bhole. Other methods, particularly those tied to strange and powerful artifacts, may work as well.
Overwhelming Strength				KEY:Bhole ~ Overwhelming Strength				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A bhole always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on all natural weapon attacks.

After leaving fiery form, a blood hag must wait 1d4 rounds before assuming it again. A blood hag in this form who enters the same space as another creature stops moving for that round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 negates) to that creature. A blood hag can suppress her heat and dim her light to that of an ember if she chooses, and can pass through openings and cracks as though in  gaseous form.  A blood hag in fiery form retains her AC and also has immunity to nonmagical attacks and effects. A successful targeted  dispel magic  spell or 20 points of cold damage returns her from her fiery form to her normal form. A blood hag can assume fiery form a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (typically 4). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Mask Evil						KEY:Blood Hag ~ Mask Evil					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:During the day, a blood hag "wears her skin," giving her the appearance of a young woman. When so disguised, the blood hag can't use her bite, claws, or fiery form ability. At night, she bursts out of her skin and returns to her monstrous form. The hag regrows her skin each dawn. While a blood hag is wearing her skin, her alignment is masked as though by a constant undetectable alignment spell.

#Bodythief
Absorb Essence					KEY:Bodythief ~ Absorb Essence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Creatures in a bodythief's stomach gain 4 negative levels (Fortitude DC 27 half) each round at the start of the bodythief's turn. A check to remove a negative level gained in this way is also DC 27. If the creature dies from the negative levels, its body disintegrates and the bodythief absorbs its life essence. This is a death effect.
Spawn Pod Creature				KEY:Bodythief ~ Spawn Pod Creature				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Once a bodythief has absorbed the life essence of a Large or smaller creature, it can begin growing a duplicate of that creature as a free action. Growing a Tiny or smaller duplicate takes 1 round, a Small duplicate 3 rounds, a Medium duplicate 5 rounds, and a Large duplicate 10 rounds. Duplicates are identical to the creature whose life essence has been devoured, but they gain the pod creature template. They closely resemble the original creature and retain all its memories. The newly created spawn has none of the original creature's equipment, though the bodythief can vomit forth any surviving swallowed gear as a move action. As the duplicate hatches, the bodythief makes a Disguise check to determine the resemblance to the original. The duplicate must be grown within 24 hours of the original's digestion, or its essence and memories dissipate. Only a single duplicate can made of any given creature.
Telepathy						KEY:Bodythief ~ Telepathy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A bodythief can communicate telepathically with its spawn at a range of up to 1000 feet.

Vexing Vines					KEY:Bodythief ~ Vexing Vines					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Each of the bodythief's tentacle vines plus its bite attack can deliver its own attack of opportunity, giving the bodythief five attacks of opportunity per round. It cannot deliver attacks of opportunity with a portion of its body being used to grapple. The bodythief can give up an attack of opportunity with a tentacle to deflect a missile as though it had the Deflect Arrows feat.

#Bodythief - Pod-Spawned Creature Template
Loss of Magic					KEY:Pod-Spawned ~ Loss of Magic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality									DESC:The pod-spawned creature loses any spellcasting ability and all spell-like and supernatural abilities that the original creature had.
Mimic							KEY:Pod-Spawned ~ Mimic						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A pod-spawned creature retains all the knowledge of its original. It can impersonate the original perfectly except for its lack of emotion. This emotionlessness can be detected with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check. A creature familiar with the original gains a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. If the pod­spawned creature feigns sincere emotion, the Sense Motive check is opposed by its Bluff check instead. Pod­spawned creatures resemble the original down to hair and blood. Noticing small physical imperfections requires a successful Perception check with a DC determined by the spawning bodythief's Disguise check, made when the pod hatches.

#Boilborn
Death Throes					KEY:Boilborn ~ Death Throes					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:When killed, a boilborn pops in a 10-foot­radius burst that deals 2d6 points of acid damage (DC 14 Reflex half).

All creatures within 120 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) or become shaken for as long as they remain within 120 feet of the broken soul. A successful save renders a creature immune to that broken soul's agonized wail for 24 hours.

This touch deals 2d6 points of slashing damage and id6 points of Dexterity damage, and causes the touched creature to fall prone in a fit of convulsions and be dazed for 1d4 rounds.

#Brethedan
Adaptation						KEY:Brethedan ~ Adaptation					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A Brethedan's body is extremely mutable, and can adapt to respond to virtually any situation. Once per round as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a Brethedan can reshape its body and chemistry to adopt any of the following qualities - Resistance 5 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire).; An additional natural attack (tentacle, bite, etc.) with damage appropriate to the Brethedan's size; Change its slam damage type to slashing or piercing; Increase its slam damage die by one step (from 1d6 to 1d8 for most Brethedans); Gain a +4 natural armor bonus to AC; Extend its reach to 20 feet. A Brethedan can only have one modification in effect at any one time-a Brethedan that selects a new adaptation loses any other in effect. More extreme adaptations are also possible (at the GM's discretion) but generally take days or even months to adopt.
Combine						KEY:Brethedan ~ Combine						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Thanks to their perfect communication, Brethedans can combine to work together as parts of a larger organism. As a swift action, a Brethedan adjacent to another can merge with it, becoming a single creature occupying both spaces. The merging Brethedan forfeits its actions to augment the other, and adds its hit points (though not its Hit Dice) to the new creature's collective total. At this time, it also chooses one adaptation-the combined creature gains this benefit, and it cannot be changed unless the combined creature uses its single adaptation action each round to do so. Any number of Brethedans can merge in this fashion, but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation each round (not once per component creature). Splitting into the component creatures again is a full-round action, in which all component creatures are released and the remaining hit points are divided evenly. For the purposes of Hit Dice-related effects, the Hit Dice of a combined Brethedan are equal to those of the component creature with the highest CR.
Engulf						KEY:Brethedan ~ Engulf						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:The creature can engulf creatures in its path as part of a standard action.  It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs.  The creature merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover.  Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack.  Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC %1 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed - on a success, they are pushed back or aside (target's choice) as the creature moves forward.  Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the creature's body until they are no longer pinned, and may be subject to other special attacks from the creature.|EngulfDC																																																																	DEFINE:EngulfDC|0	DEFINE:EngulfDieSize|0	DEFINE:EngulfDice|0	DEFINE:EngulfBonusDamage|0		ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Engulf		BONUS:VAR|EngulfDice|1	BONUS:VAR|EngulfDC|10+TL/2+STR	BONUS:VAR|EngulfDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Engulf)	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(DC %1, %2d%3+1d6 acid and paralysis)|EngulfDC|EngulfDice|EngulfDieSize

Earth Distortion					KEY:Buggane ~ Earth Distortion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Once per minute as a swift action, a buggane can empower itself to completely ignore the physicality of stone and metal, enabling it to pass through stone and metal barriers as easily as air. Until the beginning of the buggane's next turn, the buggane has earth glide and takes no damage from stone or metal weapons, or from the natural attacks of creatures of the earth subtype or stone or metal constructs. Additionally, a buggane's melee attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal or stone armor and shields. While using earth distortion, the buggane cannot damage stone or metal constructs or creatures of the earth subtype with its natural attacks.
Smash and Bash					KEY:Buggane ~ Smash and Bash					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:As a free action, a buggane can attempt to trip an opponent it damages with its rend attack without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the trip attempt fails, the buggane cannot be tripped in return. If the trip attempt is successful, the target must succeed at a DC %1 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.|13+STR

#Cephalophore
Dazing Gaze						KEY:Cephalophore ~ Dazing Gaze				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:A cephalophore can make a gaze attack that affects all seeing creatures within a 60-foot radius. These creatures must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that successfully save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|15+WIS
Dazing Strike					KEY:Cephalophore ~ Dazing Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:A creature struck by the cephalophore's slam attack must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Those who save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|15+WIS
Shatter Weapon					KEY:Cephalophore ~ Shatter Weapon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:When a character strikes a cephalophore with a weapon, the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage (apply its hardness normally). A weapon that takes damage in excess of its hardness gains the broken condition.
Statue Form						KEY:Cephalophore ~ Statue Form				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:If a cephalophore stands perfectly still, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue. An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the cephalophore is alive. If a cephalophore initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.

#Chaneque
Steal Soul						KEY:Chaneque ~ Steal Soul					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:As a ranged attack, a chaneque can pelt an opponent with a ritually prepared, soul-stealing fey skull. If the skull strikes its target, she must succeed at a DC %1 Will saving throw to prevent it from ripping her soul from her body. If the victim fails the saving throw, the skull temporarily devours her soul, leaving her vulnerable to the commands of whoever holds the skull. Thereafter, the skull's possessor can use it to command the victim, as the dominate person spell. The soul remains stolen until the possessor chooses to release the victim or the skull is destroyed. While a chaneque can carry multiple skulls on its belt, it can only manipulate single soul at one time.|12+WIS

#Clockwork Dragon
Adamantine Weapons				KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Adamantine Weapons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:The teeth and claws of a clockwork dragon are made of adamantine and have the qualities of a weapon made from that material.

Destroyer Clockwork Dragon			KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Destroyer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:These clockwork dragons are used as highly mobile and powerful siege engines. While the destroyer clockwork dragon lacks a breath weapon, as a full-round action taken while on solid ground, it can move its gears to pull its wings apart and to rise up as a heavy bombard (Ultimate Combat 161). The body of the clockwork is used as the platform for the bombard, and the internal workings of the clockwork can load the bombard without a crew, though it still takes five full-round actions on the part of the clockwork to load the bombard. The clockwork dragon can also take the actions necessary to aim the bombard. A clockwork dragon carries enough ammunition to fire the bombard 10 times.
Flaming Tar Breath Weapon			KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Flaming Tar				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:These clockwork dragons spray a 30-foot cone of flaming tar. Creatures in the area of effect take 14d6 points of fire damage and are entangled in a thick layer of flaming tar. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled effect. Creatures are entangled for 5 rounds as the tar burns. Entangled creatures take 3d6 points of fire damage each round on their turn. Spending a full-round action and succeeding at a DC 22 Reflex save removes the tar, freeing the trapped creature from the entanglement and further fire damage.
Efficient Winding					KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Efficient Winding			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Built for long and dangerous missions, a clockwork dragon can function for 3 days per Hit Die each time it's wound.
Infiltrator Clockwork Dragon			KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Infiltrator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Supernatural					DESC:These clockwork dragons are more subtle and nimble than those of other clockwork dragons. An infiltrator clockwork dragon can rearrange its movable parts into very serpentine and compact shapes, which gives it the compression ability. Furthermore, its parts are coated with a black, noise-dampening resin, granting it a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks (typically Stealth +0). Finally, it's infused with magic allowing it, as a standard action, to become invisible as the greater invisibility spell (CL 15th) three times per day. The infiltrator clockwork dragon's invisibility is a supernatural ability.

Mithral Construction				KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Mithral Construction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Once per day as a swift action, the clockwork dragon can gain the benefits of the haste spell for 1d4 rounds.
Rusting Breath					KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Rusting Breath			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Rust-breath clockwork dragons do not breathe fire. Instead, the creatures breathe out a fine mist of an alchemical solvent that instantly rusts exposed metals. This so-called "rust breath" forth in a 60-foot line. Creatures can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid the effect for attended items; however, they need to make a separate attempt for each exposed item. Each alchemical dragon can hold enough of the alchemical solvent to make up to three breath weapon attacks before the solvent must be refilled manually, which takes 10 minutes. These clockwork dragons are made of ironwood, adamantine, and other resistant materials immune to rusting of any form.
Self-Destruction					KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Self-Destruction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:When a clockwork dragon's hit points are reduced to 10%% of its total (17 in the case of most clockwork dragons) or less but are still above 0, the creature self-destructs on its next turn, bursting into an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 10d6 points of slashing damage plus 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Charisma-based.
Sleep Gas Breath					KEY:Clockwork Dragon ~ Sleep Gas Breath			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:This clockwork dragon's breath weapon is replaced with tanks of sleep gas. When the clockwork breathes out this gas in a 30-foot cone, creatures within the cone must succeed a DC 22 Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+10 rounds. Clockwork dragons with this breath weapon tend to have either the infiltrator or mithral variants, and often they have both variants. These clockwork dragons excel at missions that require stealth and precision rather than brute force.

#Clockwork Mage
Wand Magic						KEY:Clockwork Mage ~ Wand Magic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:A clockwork mage's wand crystal allows it to cast spells as if using a spell trigger magic item. The arcane school of the wand crystal determines a clockwork mage's spells. They cast 1st-level spells at will, 2nd-level spells 3 times per day, and 3rd level spells 1 time per day.

#Clockwork Steed
Powerful Kick					KEY:Clockwork Steed ~ Powerful Kick				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:As a standard action, the clockwork steed can make two hoof attacks with its rear hooves; if both hit, it can perform an awesome blow combat maneuver as the Awesome Blow feat. A clockwork steed gains a +4 racial bonus on this combat maneuver check.
Clockwork Steed ~ Charger			KEY:Clockwork Steed ~ Clockwork Charger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Clockwork chargers are constructed to wreak greater mechanized terror on the battlefield. A clockwork charger is specially equipped for enhancing mounted charges or making such charges even without a rider by way of its pivoted lance. A clockwork charger has a pivoted latch large enough to support a lance and allows even those who are not proficient with a lance to use it as if they were. Furthermore, the clockwork charger is proficient with any lance equipped in the pivot and gains the undersized weapon special ability.

#Colossus (Flesh)
Alternate Form					KEY:Colossus (Flesh) ~ Alternate Form			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:As a full-round action, a flesh colossus can break apart into four composite creatures. These composite creatures are identical to flesh golems but lack the golem's DR and the berserk and immunity to magic abilities. They gain DR 5/epic, electricity absorption, and selective antimagic aura (10 feet). Divide the colossus's current total hit points by 4 to determine how many hit points each composite creature has. Reverting into a single form requires all of the remaining composite creatures to be adjacent to each other and a full-round action. When this occurs, add up the remaining hit points to determine the colossus's total hit points.
Selective Antimagic Aura			KEY:Colossus (Flesh) ~ Antimagic Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:SelectiveAntimagicRange|0	DESC:Spells and abilities with the electricity descriptor or that deal electricity damage are unaffected by this field, as are necromancy spells and effects.

#Colossus (Stone)
Alternate Form					KEY:Colossus (Stone) ~ Alternate Form			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A stone colossus can take the form of a small keep as a full-round action.

#Colour Out of Space
Aura of Lassitude					KEY:Colour Out of Space ~ Aura of Lassitude		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Aura						DESC:A creature within 300 feet of a colour out of space (even when the colour is hiding within a solid object) must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or become overwhelmed with listlessness and ennui. While under this effect, the creature takes a -4 penalty on all Will saving throws, and doesn't willingly travel farther than a mile from the area where it failed its saving throw against that colour's aura of lassitude. A break enchantment spell (DC %1) ends the effect, as does removing the victim from the aura's area of effect. Every 24 hours, a creature affected by an aura of lassitude can attempt a new DC %1 Will save to cast off the effects of the aura. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to that colour's aura of lassitude for 24 hours. A creature that is under the effects of an aura of lassitude from a colour out of space can't be further affected by this ability from other colours. This is a mind-affecting effect.|CHA+16																																									ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(300 ft., DC %1)|CHA+16

A successful DC %1 Fortitude save halves the damage caused by a colour out of space's touch attack.

Feed							KEY:Colour Out of Space ~ Feed				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:A colour can attempt to feed on any living creature or a region of plant life as a full-round action. If it feeds on a single creature, the colour must have line of sight and be within 300 feet of the target. If it feeds on a region of plant and animal life, it only needs to be within that region. It can attempt to feed on a region once per week, and upon a living creature at will (but only once per day per living creature). Feeding on a region of plant life is automatically successful, blighting that region of plant life as if by a diminish plants spell used to stunt growth. A creature can resist being fed upon by a colour out of space by succeeding at a DC %1 Will save, in which case the colour must wait 24 hours before attempting to feed on that creature again. If this saving throw fails, the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma drain and Constitution drain. A creature whose Constitution score is drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack immediately dies, crumbling into a mass of desiccated tissue.

Any electricity resistance blocks this effect unless the target willingly submits. Otherwise the flames persist until the wyrd is out of range. Targets of this effect take a -10 penalty on Stealth checks. A comozant wyrd can communicate empathically with creatures subject to this effect, and gains a +4 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks when doing so.

This affects all aberrations, animals, magical beasts, oozes, and vermin within 300 feet that have the aquatic subtype (Will DC %1 negates).

He must designate this attack before making the attack roll. If he hits, the blow ignores the target's hardness and damage reduction, and allows him to make a free trip attempt against the target. This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, can target a foe of any size, and has no chance of causing Kostchtchie to fall prone if he fails.

Possession is permanent, but Pazuzu can only possess one creature at a time. When Pazuzu isn't actively controlling the target, it can take its own actions. Dispel chaos or dispel evil ends this possession effect as if it were an enchantment spell, but unless the caster of the spell succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check, as a swift action Pazuzu can attempt to possess the caster as he is driven out of the target. A creature possessed by Pazuzu is immune to protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and any similar effects.|35+CHA

As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing creature, marking it with a unique symbol. For as long as the creature is marked, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see false divinity). The target can also telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance while on the same plane. An advodaza can dismiss its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, cause pain to a mark bearer that deals 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw.

#Devilbound Creature
Contract Bound					KEY:Devilbound Creature ~ Contract Bound			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:The creature has signed a contract of service in return for this template. The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can't hide the details of the contract in any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template's abilities, whether immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are completed. The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature's soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies, its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in Hell as one of the devil's belongings. If the devil is dead when the creature dies, the creature's soul is destroyed, and can't be restored to life except by miracle or wish. If the creature fails to perform the tasks in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not obligated to provide the promised abilities. Many contracts state that the devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature. This doesn't protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil. Breaking a contract with a devil is difficult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can't be restored to life after death except by a miracle or wish. If the devilbound creature is restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as discern location) of the creature responsible.			ASPECT:SaveBonus|+4 on saves vs. poison

Sacred Site						KEY:Divine Guardian ~ Sacred Site				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Each divine guardian is assigned to guard a specific site sacred to the deity that invested it with power. This area may be a structure, a series of structures, or a natural site with clearly defined borders. It can be as large as a city, but in most cases it's a single temple or a sacred grove. Gods don't waste their powers on places that their worshipers can protect, so most divine guardians keep watch over abandoned burial grounds or lost temples. The divine guardian of such a site is charged with protecting it from harm and preventing incursions by those not of the faith. It must keep its vigil until the god deems the guardian's task done. If the divine guardian ever moves out of the area defined as the sacred site, it immediately loses the divine guardian template and any spellcasting ability the deity might have granted from class levels. It cannot regain the template unless it atones for its failure (usually by completing some quest or via an atonement spell) and reenters the site within 1 week. Otherwise, it loses the template permanently, taking 6d6 points of Constitution drain as the years of lost food, drink, and sleep return to it tenfold. A creature that lacks a Constitution score takes 2d6 points of damage per Hit Die from this process. Even if it survives the Constitution drain, the creature can never regain the template.

Disgusting Demise					KEY:Fleshwarp (Grothlut) ~ Disgusting Demise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:When a grothlut reaches 0 or fewer hit points, its digestive organs rupture, freeing alchemical agents that have a violent effect on the rest of the grothlut's internal organs and flesh.

Partial Invisibility				KEY:Flying Polyp ~ Partial Invisibility			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A flying polyp's body constantly flickers and shifts, passing from visibility to invisibility in a seemingly random pattern and often not wholly at once, leaving the creature's body in what appear to be multiple sections. This ability, combined with the flying polyp's amorphous, elastic form, makes it difficult to target the creature, granting it a 20%% miss chance against all attacks. By concentrating, a flying polyp can become fully invisible.
Sucking Wind					KEY:Flying Polyp ~ Sucking Wind				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:This attack allows the flying polyp to send an eerie wind out to slow and eventually stop a creature's escape. The wind itself isn't particularly strong, but it creates a peculiar sucking sensation as if it were attempting to pull creatures back toward the flying polyp. Activating this ability is a full-round action, and it must concentrate each round to maintain the effect. The sucking wind manifests as a 100-foot-radius spread, with the flying polyp at the center. Each round the polyp maintains concentration, the sucking wind's radius increases by 100 feet, to a maximum radius of a mile. A flying polyp can detect creatures within this area via tremorsense. As a free action, it can increase the effects of the sucking wind on up to five different creatures within the area at one time. Each targeted creature must succeed at a DC %1 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area of the sucking wind or it is slowed until it leaves the area. A creature already under the effects of any slowing effect (such as from this sucking wind or a slow spell) that fails this save is held in place for 1 round—it is not helpless, but cannot move via any means. Freedom of movement protects against the effects of the sucking wind, and control winds negates its effects in the area of effect of the control winds spell. Natural windstorms or other powerful winds have no effect on a sucking wind.

All creatures within this area take 14d6 points of bludgeoning damage, with a successful DC %1 Reflex save halving the damage.

If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown slowly. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC %1 Fortitude save to cough up this water; if it fails, it falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the next round, a fallen target must attempt another DC %1 Fortitude save, dropping to –1 hit points and dying if it fails; on the next round it must attempt to save again or lose 1d6 hit points.

If a fossegrim speaks, moves, attacks, or uses any of its special abilities or spell-like abilities while in treasure form, the illusion dissipates. A successful DC %1 Will save is required to disbelieve this illusion. If a living creature within the fossegrim's melee reach touches or physically interacts with the illusion, the fossegrim reaches out to kiss or otherwise touch that creature, automatically affecting the creature with its drowning touch ability. The fossegrim can maintain this illusion indefinitely and can revert to its normal natural form as a free action. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.|14+CHA

#Freezing Flow
Crystalline						KEY:Freezing Flow ~ Crystalline				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:As a creature of living ice, a freezing flow is difficult to discern from its surroundings in icy and snowy land environments and when in icy water. A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a freezing flow in these environments. Any creature that fails to notice a freezing flow and walks into it automatically takes damage as if struck by the ooze's slam attack.
Jagged Slam						KEY:Freezing Flow ~ Jagged Slam				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A freezing flow's slam attack is a slashing tendril of crystalline ice. It deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage and has a critical range of 19–20.

#Fungal Creature
Create Spawn					KEY:Fungal Creature ~ Create Spawn				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A creature killed by Constitution damage from a fungal creature's poison spore cloud transforms into a fungal spawn over a period of 24 hours. A plant growth spell halves the transformation time, and a diminish plants spell doubles it. A blight spell destroys the fungal spores and prevents the corpse's transformation, but spells that remove disease are ineffective against the growing spores. Once a creature fully transforms into a fungal spawn, the corpse from which it grew is destroyed. A fungal spawn gains the fungal creature template, but it loses all class levels and memories of the base creature from which it was spawned. If the base creature has 1 or fewer racial Hit Dice and normally has class levels, use a 1st-level warrior version of it as the base creature. The fungal spawn awakens as a free-willed being that knows all it needs to know (including language) in order to use its abilities and survive. Although it bears no allegiance to the fungal creature that created it, the new fungal creature immediately recognizes other fungal creatures as its own kind.

Poison Spore Cloud				KEY:Fungal Creature ~ Poison Spore Cloud			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Once per day, a fungal creature can release a choking cloud of spores in a 15-foot-radius spread that lingers in the air for 10 rounds. This cloud functions as an inhaled poison. Any breathing creature in the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or inhale the spores. A creature that remains in the area of the spore cloud must continue to attempt Fortitude saves against its effects. Multiple spore clouds from multiple fungal creatures require multiple saves from any creature in an area where the clouds overlap.
Poisonous Blood					KEY:Fungal Creature ~ Poisonous Blood			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A fungal creature's blood and flesh are ingested poisons. Any creature that makes a bite attack against a fungal creature, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save or be afflicted by the poison. A fungal creature can drain its own blood to procure an ingested poison. However, its blood has a distinctive and largely unwelcome smell and taste, so most intelligent creatures would refuse to eat food tainted with it unless the taste was thoroughly disguised (which requires a successful DC 15 Profession [cook] check). The fungal creature must deal at least 1 point of damage to itself to get a full dose of poison, and the drawn blood (or amputated flesh) retains its poisonous nature for only 24 hours unless additional living fungal blood is mixed into it.
Rejuvenation					KEY:Fungal Creature ~ Rejuvenation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A fungal creature gains all the sustenance it requires from contact with moist natural earth, but it must rejuvenate itself as often and for as long as humans need sleep. As long as it is in contact with moist natural earth, a resting fungal creature regains hit points as though it were undergoing complete bed rest and long term care (4 hit points per Hit Die for each day of rest). The fungal creature can engage in light activity during rejuvenation, but any strenuous activity (like fighting, running, or casting a spell) prevents it from regaining hit points for that day. Complete bed rest doesn't increase the amount of healing a fungal creature gains from rejuvenation.

#Gaki

A gaki that finds a corpse or is offered food, wine, holy water, or flowers must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or spend one turn trying to grab and consume it. Its narrow neck prevents it from swallowing more than a tiny amount, and it gives up after 1 round of attempting to do so. A gaki that consumes holy water in this way is not harmed by it.

#Gallowdead
Aura of Whispers					KEY:Gallowdead ~ Aura of Whispers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Aura						DESC:A gallowdead constantly whispers vile secrets and blasphemous chants. Any creature within 30 feet of a gallowdead must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Already shaken creatures that fail this saving throw become nauseated by the secrets revealed. Each round, an affected creature can make a new Will save to recover from the effect—once a creature recovers from a gallowdead's whispers, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Each overlapping whisper aura from additional gallowdead increases the save DC by 2. This is a language-based sonic effect.|22+CHA	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(30 ft., DC %1)|22+CHA
Chains of the Dead				KEY:Gallowdead ~ Chains of the Dead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:When a gallowdead uses its spiked chain, the first attack that hits a foe during the gallowdead's turn deals an extra 12d6 points of negative energy damage (Will DC %1 half). This has no effect on undead creatures. In addition, the gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check against its target with a +4 racial bonus. If the check succeeds, the target becomes grappled, but the gallowdead doesn't gain the grappled condition. The gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check each round to maintain its grip on the victim, but can't take any special grapple actions against the victim except the move special action. When grappling a victim in this way, the gallowdead can't attack with its spiked chain.|22+CHA

Swarmlike						KEY:Galvo ~ Swarmlike						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A galvo has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. It is also immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). Mind-affecting effects that target a single creature function normally against a galvo, since the creature's individual components share a hive mind. A galvo takes half again as much damage (+50%%) from damaging area effects such as fireball and splash weapons.
Varied Attack					KEY:Galvo ~ Varied Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A galvo's slam attack deals both bludgeoning and slashing damage since the creature is formed completely of biting eels.

Starvation Aura					KEY:Gashadokuro ~ Starvation Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A gashadokuro emits a powerful aura that causes all creatures within range to feel the intense pains of starvation. Each creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be fatigued and succumb to the supernatural starvation of the gashadokuro, taking 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the end of its turn each round it remains in the aura. Even after leaving the area or slaying the gashadokuro, an affected creature continues to starve and cannot heal from the nonlethal damage dealt by this ability until it consumes food.

#Gearghost
Create Trap						KEY:Gearghost ~ Create Trap					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Once per week, a gearghost can create a trap of CR 4 or lower regardless of cost, materials, or skill checks.

Spiritual Manipulation				KEY:Geist ~ Spiritual Manipulation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Geists have the ability to take control of haunts (GameMastery Guide 242). When a geist enters a haunt's area of effect, the geist can immediately attempt to take over the haunt by making a Charisma check. If the result of the Charisma check is equal to or greater than the haunt's CR, the geist takes over the haunt and maintains control as long as the geist remains within 1 mile. If the geist's attempt to take control of a haunt fails, the geist must retreat from the haunt's area of effect and cannot attempt to take control of the haunt again for 24 hours. When a geist controls a haunt, it can activate or suppress the haunt's effects as a free action and the haunt automatically resets in half its normal time. A haunt under a geist's control can still be neutralized when reduced to 0 hit points, but it cannot be permanently put to rest until the geist that controls it is destroyed. A geist can control a number of haunts up to its Charisma modifier at one time (usually five).
Terrifying Laugh					KEY:Geist ~ Terrifying Laugh					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Once per minute, a geist can unleash a terrifying laugh as a standard action. The laughter lasts until the beginning of the geist's next turn. All creatures within 30 feet of the geist when it begins to laugh, as well as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be panicked.

With its skin, it gains DR 5/bludgeoning, natural armor +6, and speed 30, but loses its amorphous and compression abilities. It can liquefy this skin as a full-round action, losing its DR and natural armor, changing its speed to 10 feet, and regaining the amorphous and compression abilities. The golem normally maintains its congealed skin, liquefying itself only when it has to pass through obstacles that would hinder its solid form.
Immunity to Magic					KEY:Golem (Blood) ~ Immunity to Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A blood golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.

#Golem (Wax)
Conditional Sentience				KEY:Golem (Wax) ~ Conditional Sentience			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A wax golem constructed to look like a humanoid (whether a particular individual or not) has a small chance of gaining sentience and genuinely believing it is a living creature. Each week, such a wax golem has a cumulative 1%% chance of becoming sentient (on the second week the chance is 2%%, the third week 3%%, and so on), to a maximum of 5%%. If it does attain sentience, the golem gains an Intelligence score of 10, retroactive skill points, feats dependent on its Hit Dice, and 1 class level with the potential to gain more. If it was crafted to resemble a specific individual, it also gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that individual. A sentient wax golem ventures into the world and tries to live a life similar to that of the person (or type of person) it resembles. However, if the sentient wax golem ever encounters the person it is modeled after, it attempts to stealthily kill that person and take her place. The only way for a sentient wax golem to lose its sentience is either to take an amount of fire damage equal to half its hit points (which melts its features away) or to be destroyed.
Immunity to Magic					KEY:Golem (Wax) ~ Immunity to Magic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A wax golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the fire descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature.  A magical attack that deals fire damage slows a wax golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). In addition, for 3 rounds after taking fire damage, every time a wax golem uses its slam attack, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage due to its molten wax; A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wax golem gains no saving throw against cold effects.

#Graeae
Coven							KEY:Graeae ~ Coven						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Like hags, graeaes also form covens. A graeae coven can be composed entirely of graeaes, or could or include hags or witches with the coven hex. A hag or witch with the coven hex counts as a graeae for purposes of joining a graeae's coven. Likewise, a graeae counts as a hag for purposes of joining a hag's coven. [Graeae Coven] Whenever three or more graeaes of the same coven are within 10 feet of one another, they can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities: clairaudience/clairvoyance, commune, contact other plane, speak with dead, and tongues. All three graeaes must spend a full-round action to take part in this form of cooperative magic. All coven spell-like abilities are CL 9th (or at the highest caster level available to the most powerful graeaes in the coven).
Eye of the Graeae					KEY:Graeae ~ Eye of the Graeae				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Each graeae possesses a mystic eyeball. A graeae can sense the location of her eyeball from anywhere on the same plane.

If a graeae is slain, her mystic eye instantly turns to dust.
Fate Casting					KEY:Graeae ~ Fate Casting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A graeae has the ability to predict future events. On a creature's request, a graeae can expend a use of mythic power as a full-round action to answer a single question as if by the divination spell.
Luck Ripple						KEY:Graeae ~ Luck Ripple					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A graeae can use her mystic eye to alter the circumstances of any creature within 30 feet. As a swift action, she can cast her eye on a single creature, causing the target to take a –2 penalty or gain a +2 bonus to one of the following (graeae's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. A successful DC %1 Will save negates the effect, which otherwise lasts for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting gaze effect.|INT+13

#Great Old One (Bokrug)
Critical Poisoning				KEY:Great Old One (Bokrug) ~ Critical Poisoning		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:If Bokrug confirms a critical hit with his sting, he injects his foe with 3 doses of poison (this increases the save DC by 4). A foe that is normally immune to poison can be affected by Bokrug's poison in this way, but treats the poisoning as if it had been injected with only 1 dose.
Immortality						KEY:Great Old One (Bokrug) ~ Immortality			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:If Bokrug is killed, his body immediately begins to thrash and writhe spasmodically, continuing to do so for 1d4 rounds. During this time, he makes a single sting attack against one random target in reach. At the end of this time, his body grows still, then melts into water and evaporates away. Bokrug reforms in dormancy back in his realm in the Dimension of Dreams soon thereafter, remaining in a comatose state for hundreds of years unless he is awoken earlier via complex rituals. Any effect that destroys Bokrug's body (such as disintegrate) merely reduces his remains to water that then evaporates away as described above, but such measures do prevent his body from thrashing and stinging prior to this supernatural evaporation.
Poison						KEY:Great Old One (Bokrug) ~ Poison				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Sting—injury; save Fort DC %1; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Wisdom damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. A creature whose Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom score automatically becomes afflicted by a random insanity (GameMastery Guide 250).|25+CHA
Spines						KEY:Great Old One (Bokrug) ~ Spines				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Any creature that makes a melee attack against Bokrug must succeed at a DC %1 Reflex save or be struck by the numerous swiftly reacting spines that cover the Great Old One, taking 2d6+15 points of damage. Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way.|25+DEX
Toxic Breath					KEY:Great Old One (Bokrug) ~ Toxic Breath			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura	DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Bokrug's breath is toxic. Whenever the Great Old One is above water, he is surrounded by a 30-foot-radius cloud of invisible poison gas that causes temporary madness and hallucinations. Any creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that holds its breath or doesn't have to breathe gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw. This is a mind-affecting poison effect.|25+CON		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(30 ft., DC %1)|25+CON
Unspeakable Presence				KEY:Great Old One (Bokrug) ~ Unspeakable Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura	DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Failing a DC %1 Will save against Bokrug's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become overwhelmed with hopelessness and doom—it takes a –4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls as long as it remains within the area of affect.|25+CHA																										ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(300 ft., DC %1)|25+CHA
Vengeful Dreams					KEY:Great Old One (Bokrug) ~ Vengeful Dreams		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Any creature that has ever damaged Bokrug or has slain one of his clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's vengeful dreams regardless of the distance between the creature and Bokrug, even across planar boundaries. In order to use vengeful dreams against a target, Bokrug must successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability; the target is always treated as familiar to Bokrug, and as if Bokrug possessed a body part of the victim, resulting in a –15 penalty on the saving throw against the nightmare. If the victim fails its save against the nightmare, the horrific dream unfolds as a vision of Bokrug consuming the victim alive. The victim then remains alive, conscious, and aware as the Great Old One digests it, and as Bokrug destroys all that remains of the victim's lifelong friends, home, belongings, and family. When the victim awakens from the nightmare, it must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or take 3d6 points of Wisdom drain from the vengeful dreams. If this drains the target's Wisdom to 0, it automatically gains a random insanity (GameMastery Guide 250). Once Bokrug uses this ability against a creature, he can't do so again until that creature again damages him or slays one of his clerics. This is a mind-affecting effect.|25+CHA

#Great Old One (Cthulhu)
Cleaving Claws					KEY:Great Old One (Cthulhu) ~ Cleaving Claws		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:A single attack from one of Cthulhu's claws can target all creatures in a 10-foot square.

Dreams of Madness					KEY:Great Old One (Cthulhu) ~ Dreams of Madness		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:When Cthulhu uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature with one or more ranks in a Craft or Perform skill, he also afflicts the creature with maddening dreams. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or contract a random insanity (GameMastery Guide 250). This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that already has an insanity is immune to this ability.|28+CHA
Greater Starflight				KEY:Great Old One (Cthulhu) ~ Greater Starflight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through outer space at incredible speeds. Although the exact travel time will vary from one trip to the next, a trip within a solar system normally takes Cthulhu 2d6 hours, and a trip beyond normally takes 2d6 days (or more, at the GM's discretion).
Immortality						KEY:Great Old One (Cthulhu) ~ Immortality			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:If Cthulhu is killed, his body immediately fades away into a noxious cloud of otherworldly vapor that fills an area out to his reach. This cloud blocks vision as obscuring mist, but can't be dispersed by any amount of wind. Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC %1 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for an additional 1d10 rounds after it leaves the area. Cthulhu returns to life after 2d6 rounds, manifesting from the cloud and restored to life via true resurrection, but is staggered for 2d6 rounds (nothing can remove this staggered effect). If slain again while he is staggered from this effect, Cthulhu reverts to vapor form again and his essence fades away after 2d6 rounds, returning to his tomb in R'lyeh until he is released again.|28+CON
Non-Euclidean					KEY:Great Old One (Cthulhu) ~ Non-Euclidean		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Cthulhu does not exist wholly in the physical world, and space and time strain against his presence. This grants Cthulhu a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to his Charisma modifier. His apparent and actual position are never quite the same, granting him a 50%% miss chance against all attacks. True seeing can defeat this miss chance, but any creature that looks upon Cthulhu while under the effects of true seeing must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity (this is a mind-affecting effect).|28+CHA
Unspeakable Presence				KEY:Great Old One (Cthulhu) ~ Unspeakable Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura	DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Failing a DC %1 Will save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence causes the victim to immediately die of fright. This is a death and fear effect. A creature immune to fear that fails its save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence is staggered for 1d6 rounds instead of killed.|28+CHA		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(300 ft., DC %1)|28+CHA

#Great Old One (Hastur)
Fulvous Dreams					KEY:Great Old One (Hastur) ~ Fulvous Dreams		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:When Hastur uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature that has seen the Yellow Sign, he also afflicts that creature with horrifying dreams tinted with a nauseating yellow color and thick with overwhelming sensations of decadence, shame, and entropic disorder. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must also succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be compelled to seek out a Yellow Sign, throwing all of his resources and actions into the obsession. While obsessed, the target takes a –4 penalty on Will saving throws, saving throws against symbol spells, concentration checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks. This obsession effect ends immediately if the victim looks upon the Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.|27+CHA
Immortality						KEY:Great Old One (Hastur) ~ Immortality			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:If Hastur is slain, the robes that drape his frame suddenly drop to the ground as if whatever shape supported them had suddenly ceased to exist. The robes themselves remain inanimate on the ground, but any humanoid creature that touches them must succeed at a DC %1 Will save to resist a sudden urge to put the robes on. Doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once it has donned Hastur's robes, the creature immediately perishes and its body is destroyed. In its place, Hastur lives again, as if brought back via true resurrection. If the discarded robes are not donned within 24 hours, they fade away, leaving behind a faint yellow stain. In this case, Hastur can't manifest a physical body again until the conditions are right, or until an unwitting cultist or fool calls him forth once again.|27+CHA
Reveal Visage					KEY:Great Old One (Hastur) ~ Reveal Visage		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:As a swift action, Hastur may reveal to one adjacent creature the true shape beneath his robes. The creature must succeed at DC %1 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain at the end of its turn each round the paralysis lasts, though the revelation is too awful for memory to retain. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.|27+CHA
Tattered Lash					KEY:Great Old One (Hastur) ~ Tattered Lash		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Hastur attacks with long strips of his tattered yellow robes. These strips have a reach of 40 feet and are primary natural slashing attacks. Bleed damage from the strips stacks with itself (up to 10d6 points of bleed damage). Hastur treats insane targets as if they were flat-footed when he attacks with these weapons.
Unspeakable Presence				KEY:Great Old One (Hastur) ~ Unspeakable Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura	DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Failing a DC %1 Will save against Hastur's unspeakable presence afflicts a creature with a random insanity. A creature that is already insane instead becomes confused for as long as it remains in the area.|27+CHA	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(300 ft., DC %1)|27+CHA
Wish							KEY:Great Old One (Hastur) ~ Wish				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike			DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Although Hastur may use wish as a spell-like ability at will, he can do so only to grant the wishes of other creatures, and only once per creature. Invariably, the results of these wishes serve somehow to advance Hastur's agenda.
Yellow Sign						KEY:Great Old One (Hastur) ~ Yellow Sign			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Once per day as a free action, Hastur can touch any solid surface and inscribe the Yellow Sign upon it. Once inscribed, the Yellow Sign remains for a year, but is active only on certain nights when the light from Hastur's distant world shines in the night sky as a star. Any creature that looks upon an active Yellow Sign must succeed at a DC %1 Will save to avoid becoming dominated by Hastur (as dominate monster); whether or not the save is successful, the creature doesn't have to save against that Yellow Sign again for 24 hours. While the creature is under this domination effect, if the creature's Charisma drain plus Charisma damage ever equal its Charisma score, it immediately dies and allows Hastur to manifest physically at the location of its corpse, as if the victim had donned Hastur's tattered robes (see immortality).

#Gremlin (Grimple)
Gremlin Lice					KEY:Gremlin (Grimple) ~ Gremlin Lice			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:All grimples are infested with gremlin lice. Whenever a warm-blooded creature comes in physical contact with a grimple, there is a 25%% chance it contracts gremlin lice. 1d4 rounds later, the creature begins to itch. The itch proves so distracting that for the duration of the infestation, the individual takes a –1 penalty on all concentration and initiative checks. Fortunately, these annoying parasites cannot live long on non-gremlins, and only survive for 24 hours. Submersion in water or exposure to freezing temperatures also kills a gremlin lice infestation.

Misplacement					KEY:Gremlin (Haniver) ~ Misplacement			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Hanivers are swift and curious, possessing an uncanny ability to meddle with the possessions of any character whose square they enter. Any time a haniver succeeds at a Sleight of Hand check against a creature, it also rearranges that creature's possessions. The next time that creature attempts to produce a weapon or item, it finds its possessions misplaced or disarranged; retrieving a stored item or drawing a weapon then requires a standard action instead of a move action (unless the haniver has stolen the item in question). After spending this standard action, the character takes mental inventory and is no longer affected by this ability. Occasionally, hanivers replace items they've stolen or leave their old treasures—seashells, old fish, clumps of sand—in containers or clothing they have rooted through. They do this without any added difficultly to their Sleight of Hand checks.

A monaciello that loses its pouch must create a new one, a process that takes 1d4 days. Until the new pouch is finished, it remains a non-magical bag, only becoming a fully functional extradimensional space once completed.

The creature isn't under the dragon's control, but won't willingly attack the dragon unless magically forced to do so. Alternatively, the dragon can expend one use of mythic power to create difficult terrain in a 100-foot-radius burst; the type of difficult terrain is appropriate to the area (mud in plains, rubble in mountains, and so on).

The demiplane is approximately a 500-foot-diameter sphere, and the dragon usually fills it with a maze of corridors (most of which are large enough for the Gargantuan dragon to move through) to confuse and delay invaders intent on stealing its treasure. The demiplane's portal is connected to a spot in the dragon's hidden lair, and over time the dragon usually brings guardian creatures from the Material Plane to add to the demiplane's defenses. The dragon can have only one demiplane active at a time, and the demiplane dissolves 10d10 minutes after the dragon leaves, so the dragon leaves only for a few minutes at a time or if its treasure has been stolen.
Vengeful Seeker					KEY:Guardian Dragon ~ Vengeful Seeker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A guardian dragon gains the swift tracker and quarry abilities of a ranger when tracking or hunting any creature that has confirmed a critical hit against it, penetrated its spell resistance, or taken any amount of its treasure.

Whenever the juggernaut takes energy damage or energy damage fails to overcome its SR, for the next round, its attacks deal 2d6 points of damage of that energy type.

Fascination Aura					KEY:Julunggali ~ Fascination Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura						DESC:Any creature within 100 feet of the julunggali who can see it must succeed at a Will save (DC %1) or be fascinated as long as it remains within range. A creature that saves against the julunggali's aura is immune to it for 24 hours.|CHA+21		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(100 ft., DC %1)|CHA+21
Poison						KEY:Julunggali ~ Poison						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Supernatural					DESC:A julunggali has three different poisons. Each time it bites, it decides which poison to inject. Julunggali Venom: Bite—injury; save Fort DC %1; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con or 1d6 Dex or age one age category (julunggali's choice); cure 2 consecutive saves.|21+CON

#Kaiju (Agyra)
Blinding Flash					KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Blinding Flash				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:By spreading her wings as a full-round action while she stands upon the ground, Agyra can create a blinding flash of light that targets all creatures within 100 feet. Affected creatures must succeed at a DC %1 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded and staggered for 1d6 rounds by the blast of light. A successful saving throw reduces the blindness to 1 round and negates the staggered effect.|26+CON
Breath Weapon					KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Breath Weapon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, each of Agyra's twin heads can breathe out a line of electricity to a range of 1,200 feet. Agyra can breathe each line in a different direction. Each creature caught in a line of electricity must succeed at a DC %1 Reflex save or take 20d6 points of electricity damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. A creature struck by both breath weapons simultaneously must attempt separate saving throws against each breath weapon, but takes a –4 penalty on both—the damage and staggered condition duration stack with each other. A creature wearing medium or heavy metal armor or a creature composed mostly of metal that fails its saving throw is also stunned for 1 round. A creature slain by Agyra's breath weapon remains electrified for 2d4 rounds after death—any creature that touches the body automatically takes 3d6 points of electricity damage.|26+CON
Electrified Corpse				KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Electrified Corpse			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:If Agyra is slain, her corpse crackles and flashes with pulses of electrical light if she has not used her rebirth ability that year. Any creature that touches her corpse takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Even if Agyra's body is destroyed, the site of her death continues to carry this electrical charge for 1 minute, or until Agyra is reborn, whichever comes first.
Hurricane						KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Hurricane					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike			DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Once per day, Agyra can create a supernatural hurricane surrounding herself. This effect functions as control weather, save that it affects an area with a 4-mile radius, lasts for 24 hours, and can only be used to create hurricane-force winds. The hurricane created is static, and features a calm eye at the center with a 500-foot radius.
Rebirth						KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Rebirth					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Agyra remains dead for only 1 minute before she come back to life, as if via a true resurrection spell. Agyra rises from the exact same position she occupied when she died, and typically takes advantage of this second chance to use her swift flight to escape as soon as possible. Agyra can only be reborn in this manner once per year; if she is slain a second time before a year has passed, her death is permanent and her corpse does not become electrified. This ability replaces Agyra's ability to immediately heal damage that would normally kill her, granted by her recovery ability, but does not replace the other defenses granted by recovery.
Storm Flier						KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Storm Flier				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Agyra does not take penalties on Fly checks when flying in strong or more powerful winds.
Swift Flight					KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Swift Flight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:As a standard action once per hour, Agyra can fly in a straight line at an incredible speed. She may travel up to 1 mile in this manner—doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When Agyra activates this ability, her thunderous blast ability is automatically triggered from the swift flight's point of origin.
Thunderous Blast					KEY:Kaiju (Agyra) ~ Thunderous Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:When Agyra uses her swift flight, she creates a thunderous sonic boom. This devastating explosion of sound occurs at her location when she activates swift flight, filling an area equal to her space and her reach combined—resulting in a 100-foot-diameter burst of sonic energy. All creatures in this area of effect take 20d10 points of sonic damage, are permanently deafened, are knocked prone, and are stunned for 1 round. A successful DC %1 Reflex save halves the damage, reduces the deafened condition to 1d4 rounds, and negates the knocked prone and stun effects entirely.|26+CON

#Kaiju (Bezravnis)
Burrowing Charge					KEY:Kaiju (Bezravnis) ~ Burrowing Charge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Once per minute, Bezravnis can make a charge attack while burrowing through loose earth, sand, mud, or magma, or through any other loosely packed earth or stone. When Bezaravnis reaches the target, it erupts from the ground as part of its attack. If Bezravnis hits the target of its burrowing charge attack, it deals double damage with its attack. Any creatures standing in or flying less than 50 feet above the space Bezravnis occupies at the end of this charge are immediately subjected to Bezravnis's trample attack. Any buildings entirely within this space take double damage from the trample attack (4d8+54 points)—this damage bypasses hardness. In addition, Huge or smaller creatures must succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save or be buried in earth, as if by a cave-in or collapse. This bury zone extends into all squares affected by Bezravnis's reach.
Heat Beam						KEY:Kaiju (Bezravnis) ~ Heat Beam				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Once every 4 rounds, Bezravnis can fire beams of searing heat and fire from one of its three stingers. Each stinger's heat beam is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju may fire one heat beam from a stinger as a move action, two heat beams as a standard action, or all three as a full-round action. Each heat beam is a 1,200-foot-long line that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to everything in its path (Reflex DC %1 half). If Bezravnis fires more than one heat beam, it can direct them in different directions.|CON+25
Poison						KEY:Kaiju (Bezravnis) ~ Poison				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Sting—injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect staggered for 1 round plus loss of fire immunity and resistance; cure 3 consecutive saves. As long as a creature suffers the effects of Bezravnis's poison, it loses all racial resistances and immunities to fire. Any spell or spell-like effects active when the target fails its initial saving throw against this poison are suppressed as long as it continues to be staggered by the poison. New effects of this nature that become active after that initial failed saving throw function normally if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check; otherwise, the spell effects are suppressed until the victim is no longer staggered.
Web							KEY:Kaiju (Bezravnis) ~ Web					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Bezravnis's webs are immune to fire damage. In addition, these webs are semi-living things that continue to crush and squeeze those entangled by them. If a creature is entangled in the webs, at the start of each turn during which it is entangled, it takes 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as the webs crush and constrict it. This ability otherwise functions the same as the universal monster ability.

#Kaiju (Mogaru)
Absorb Energy					KEY:Kaiju (Mogaru) ~ Absorb Energy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Mogaru absorbs energy attacks that damage him, including negative energy attacks. Damage blocked by one of his resistances or immunities instead heals him an amount equal to the damage dealt. He may absorb only one kind of energy in this manner in a round. The first type of energy that affects him in a round (whether or not it penetrates his immunities or resistance to actually damage him) sets the type of energy he absorbs for that round. Hit points gained in excess of his normal maximum are lost. Mogaru cannot gain healing from energy effects generated by himself.
Breath Weapon					KEY:Kaiju (Mogaru) ~ Breath Weapon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Once every 4 rounds, Mogaru can breathe out a beam of fiery red force. When Mogaru uses this attack, he can choose to focus the breath weapon into a single 1,200-foot-long line, or he can shorten the range and turn his head and body while breathing, effectively affecting a 600-foot-long cone. All creatures caught in this area of effect take 20d6 points of fire damage, 20d6 points of force damage, and are staggered for 1d6 rounds from the devastating energy (Reflex DC %1 halves the damage and prevents the staggered effect). A creature slain by this effect is disintegrated, whether the saving throw was successful or not. This breath weapon is particularly effective at blasting through cover—cover does not grant any bonuses on Reflex saves against Mogaru's breath weapon.|CON+27
Firebolts						KEY:Kaiju (Mogaru) ~ Firebolts				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:As a standard action on any round immediately following the use of his breath weapon, Mogaru can fire bolts of red energy from the glowing spines along his back. These bolts are ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. When Mogaru uses this ability, he must choose between firing one firebolt, three firebolts, or six firebolts. If he fires one, it deals 20d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires three bolts, each deals 8d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires six bolts, each deals 5d6 points of damage on a hit. Half of the damage caused by any one firebolt is fire damage, the other half is force damage. Firebolts deal full damage against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of hardness possessed by an object.
Reflexive Breath					KEY:Kaiju (Mogaru) ~ Reflexive Breath			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:The first time in any round that Mogaru can make an attack of opportunity, he can choose to use a diminished version of his breath weapon instead of making a physical attack. This reflexive breath weapon attack only targets the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity, but otherwise causes the same damage and effects his breath weapon normally inflicts (Reflex DC %1 halves the damage and negates the staggered effect). Use of his breath weapon in this way does not affect the recharge rate of the regular breath weapon. The save DC includes a –10 penalty to reflect the fact that the reflexive breath is a shorter (but no less intense) blast of energy than the kaiju's typical breath weapon attack.|CON+17
Sense Kaiju						KEY:Kaiju (Mogaru) ~ Sense Kaiju				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Mogaru can sense the location of the nearest active kaiju, as if using discern location, at will.
Susceptible to Song				KEY:Kaiju (Mogaru) ~ Susceptible to Song			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESCISPI:YES			DESC:Mogaru's actions can be influenced by song, provided the kaiju notices the singing. If the kaiju is not currently engaged in battle, he automatically hears any song within 100 feet that is directed at him in an attempt to influence him, but when he is in combat, there's only a cumulative 20%% chance per round of sustained singing that he notices the song. In order to influence Mogaru, the singer must make a DC 35 Perform (sing) check (this check cannot be bolstered by the aid another action, and the singer cannot take 10 or 20 on the check). The result of this check sets the DC of the Will save Mogaru must make in order to not be influenced by the song. The singer can choose to influence Mogaru as if she had successfully cast suggestion on the kaiju (CL = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing]). If Mogaru succeeds at a Will save (DC = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing] + the singer's Charisma modifier), the effects of the influence last for a maximum of 1d4 rounds; otherwise, the effects last as long as a suggestion spell would normally last. Mogaru cannot use his recovery ability to recover from song influence, and a single singer may influence Mogaru only once per day.

#Kapre
Blow Smoke						KEY:Kapre ~ Blow Smoke						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Smoke constantly drifts from a kapre's mouth, and as a standard action it can exhale a 30-foot cone of smoke. Any creature in the area must succeed at a DC %1 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. This is a poison effect.|CON+17
Confounding Aura					KEY:Kapre ~ Confounding Aura					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura						DESC:A magical aura surrounds a kapre, confusing and distracting its foes. Within a kapre's aura, the DC of all Survival checks is increased by 15, and creatures trained in Survival are no longer able to automatically determine true north. On top of this, any creature within a kapre's aura must succeed at a DC 21 Will saving throw when it enters the area or take a –4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and skill checks. A kapre can suppress this aura at will.		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(100 ft., DC 21)
Tree Meld						KEY:Kapre ~ Tree Meld						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A kapre can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell meld with stone functions. It can remain melded with a tree as long as it wishes.

#Karkinoi
Sideways Scuttle					KEY:Karkinoi ~ Sideways Scuttle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:When a karkinoi takes a 5-foot step, it can move up to 10 feet instead of 5 feet as long as it does so in a straight line. It can do this whether it is walking or swimming.
Water Dependency					KEY:Karkinoi ~ Water Dependency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A karkinoi can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, it runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.

#Kyton (Ostiarius)
Compel Courage					KEY:Kyton (Ostiarius) ~ Compel Courage			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:An ostiarius can inspire courage as a 5th-level bard using bardic performance, granting a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. This ability has a range of 50 feet and affects those creatures the ostiarius chooses who also willingly accept the benefits of the effect (no saving throw required). The ostiarius's performance compels creatures to perform at dangerous extremes. Any living non-outsider that benefits from this ability takes 1 point of bleed damage. A creature that accepts these benefits for multiple consecutive rounds gains additional points of bleed damage that stack with one another (to a maximum of 5). This is an audible, mind-affecting effect and can be countered by a bard's countersong class feature.
Shadow Traveler					KEY:Kyton (Ostiarius) ~ Shadow Traveler			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:When an ostiarius uses plane shift to travel to the Plane of Shadow, it arrives at its intended destination with complete accuracy. When an ostiarius uses shadow walk, it moves at 100 miles per hour.
Unnerving Gaze					KEY:Kyton (Ostiarius) ~ Unnerving Gaze			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A creature that succumbs to an ostiarius's unnerving gaze becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(30 ft., DC %1)|15+CHA

#Kyton (Sacristan)
Shadow Scream					KEY:Kyton (Sacristan) ~ Shadow Scream			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Once per hour as a standard action, a sacristan can burst the bonds sealing its mouth and unleash a cacophony of darkness and soul-shaking howls from the pits of the Shadow Plane. The area within 25 feet of the sacristan is affected by deeper darkness. All creatures within the area are deafened for as long as they remain in the area and must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or be confused. The confusion effect lasts for as long as the creature is in the shadow scream's area of effect and for 1d4 rounds after leaving. Any creature that falls unconscious while under the effects of this confusion effect must succeed at an additional DC %1 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity—roll on the insanity table on page 250 of the GameMastery Guide to determine which. A sacristan's shadow scream lasts for 3 rounds and remains centered on the kyton even if it moves. The sacristan can end the shadow scream at will. The scream also ends if the sacristan is killed or is affected by the spell dimensional lock, which prevents this ability's use for as long as the spell in effect.|CHA+16
Unnerving Gaze					KEY:Kyton (Sacristan) ~ Unnerving Gaze			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:A creature that succumbs to a sacristan's unnerving gaze becomes staggered for 1 round.		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(30 ft., DC %1)|CHA+16

#Lampad
Guarded						KEY:Lampad ~ Guarded						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A lampad adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
Insane Beauty					KEY:Lampad ~ Insane Beauty					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet who are viewing a lampad in conditions brighter than dim light. Those who look directly upon the lampad must succeed at a DC %1 Will save or gain the confused condition for 1d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the same lampad's insane beauty for 24 hours. A lampad can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.|CHA+13		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(30 ft., DC %1)|CHA+13
Spells						KEY:Lampad ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality									DESC:A lampad casts spells as a 5th-level druid, but can't swap out prepared spells to cast summon spells.
Weep							KEY:Lampad ~ Weep							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:As a standard action, a lampad can unsettle those near her when she cries. Any creature within 30 feet who can hear a lampad weeping becomes shaken unless it succeeds at a DC %1 Will saving throw. This ability can't cause a creature to become frightened or panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components.|CHA+13

#Leaf Ray
Seed							KEY:Leaf Ray ~ Seed						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Once per day, a leaf ray can implant a seed into a helpless target with its stinger. As a full-round action, the leaf ray stings its victim, depositing a seed into the victim's flesh. This process deals 1 hit point of damage to the victim, but the implanted creature isn't subject to the leaf ray's poison in this process. The seed germinates inside the victim, making it sickened while it harbors the leaf ray seed, and dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to the victim each day the seed grows within. This damage is negated with a successful DC 14 Fortitude save. The seed feeds off the victim's body and only grows into a new leaf ray tree when the victim dies from Constitution damage. Removing an implanted seed requires a successful DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of damage. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against a leaf ray seed's implantation, remove disease, heal, or similar effects automatically destroy any implanted seeds.
Poison						KEY:Leaf Ray ~ Fall Poison					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Sting—injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.
Poison						KEY:Leaf Ray ~ Spring/Summer Poison				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Sting—injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.
Poison						KEY:Leaf Ray ~ Winter Poison					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:Sting—injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 1 save.

#Leanan Sidhe
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Change Shape.COPY=Leanan Sidhe ~ Change Shape					OUTPUTNAME:Change Shape														ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(any female humanoid)
Life Drain						KEY:Leanan Sidhe ~ Life Drain					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A leanan sidhe immediately knows if a creature uses her skill blessing or spell blessing. As a standard action at any range, she can expend one use of mythic power to drain 1 point of Constitution from that creature. The leanan sidhe heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to her full normal hit points) each time she uses this ability.
Skill Blessing					KEY:Leanan Sidhe ~ Skill Blessing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:As a standard action, a leanan sidhe can create a special token that takes the form of a masterwork artisan's tool for one Craft or Perform skill. The intended recipient of this tool gains a +4 bonus on skill checks made with the token. Like with a cursed item, the recipient prefers to use the token, refuses to get rid of it, and finds that it returns if stolen or discarded. The leanan sidhe can destroy the token as a standard action at any range. She can have %1 tokens in existence.|Mythic_Rank
Spell Blessing					KEY:Leanan Sidhe ~ Spell Blessing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A leanan sidhe may enhance the magic of a willing humanoid spellcaster by touching him for 1 full round. The blessing allows the target to recall a number of spell levels each day equal to twice the leanan sidhe's mythic rank. This recalling works like a pearl of power, except it works for spellcasters of any class (spontaneous casters recover spent spell slots). The leanan sidhe can end this blessing as a standard action at any range. The number of blessed creatures she can have at the same time is %1.|Mythic_Rank
Unearthly Grace					KEY:Leanan Sidhe ~ Unearthly Grace				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A leanan sidhe adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws and as a deflection bonus to her AC.

#Living Topiary
Assimilate						KEY:Living Topiary ~ Assimilate				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:As a full-round action, a living topiary can consume undergrowth or bushy plant matter it's currently touching and incorporate that material into its form. It can do this at a rate of 5 cubic feet per round, healing 1d8 points of damage each time. If the topiary is at maximum hit points, this ability has no effect.
Hedge Stride					KEY:Living Topiary ~ Hedge Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:This ability functions as tree stride, but rather than allowing for teleportation from tree to tree, it permits the living topiary to teleport from one area of brush or hedges to another area of similar vegetation within 1,500 feet.
Move through Hedges				KEY:Living Topiary ~ Move through Hedges			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A living topiary may move through any mass of brambles or other dense plant growth without penalty. It must begin and end its turn outside of the mass.
Sculpt Shape					KEY:Living Topiary ~ Sculpt Shape				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:As a standard action, a living topiary can alter itself to take on the basic form of any creature. The change is purely cosmetic, and does not change its size, grant it any special powers, or alter its abilities.

#Living Wall
Crushing Push					KEY:Living Wall ~ Crushing Push				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A living wall adjacent to a creature that is also adjacent to a barrier (such as a dungeon wall, gate, or another living wall) can spend a standard action to crush that creature against the barrier, dealing 1d8+6 points of damage. If the living wall is grappling the target, as part of this attack it can attempt a free combat maneuver check to pin the target.
Fleshy Link						KEY:Living Wall ~ Fleshy Link					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A living wall that is adjacent to another living wall automatically links with it, forming an impassible solid barrier. Linked living walls coordinate their attacks and move as one creature. Any linked wall can unlink itself as a free action. Any damage to one linked living wall is divided evenly among all linked living walls (for example, if three walls are linked and one takes 15 points of damage, each wall instead takes 5 points of damage). Two or three linked living walls count as a Huge creature for the purpose of effects affected or limited by size (such as bull rush), four or five count as Gargantuan, and six or more count as Colossal.
Push							KEY:Living Wall ~ Push						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary							DESC:A living wall can choose to make a free combat maneuver check with a successful slam attack. If successful, this check pushes a creature 5 feet directly away as with a bull rush. This ability only works on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the pushing creature. Creatures pushed in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity and stop if the push would move them into a solid object or creature.

#Locust (Giant)

A mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and expendable resources—this effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item.
Starflight						KEY:Mi-Go ~ Starflight						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)—provided the mi-go knows the way to its destination.

Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a successful DC 15 Strength check as a standard action—doing so deals 2d6 points of damage to the host as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage in this way.

If the shredskin does not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well. A shredskin receives a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to start and maintain a grapple.

Overwhelming Mind					KEY:Star-Spawn of Cthulhu ~ Overwhelming Mind		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:A star-spawn of Cthulhu's mind is overwhelming in its power and alien structure.

Telekinesis						KEY:Vampire (Nosferatu) ~ Telekinesis			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike								DESC:As a standard action, a nosferatu can use telekinesis (caster level 12th).		SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=12|Telekinesis
Telepathy						KEY:Vampire (Nosferatu) ~ Telepathy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:A nosferatu can communicate telepathically with any creature within 60 feet that speaks the same language it does. In addition, a nosferatu can use this ability to communicate with any animal, magical beast, or vermin.
Weaknesses						KEY:Vampire (Nosferatu) ~ Weaknesses			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality									DESC:A nosferatu can't tolerate the strong odor of garlic, and won't enter an area laced with it. Similarly, it recoils from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the nosferatu—they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling nosferatu must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and can't touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a nosferatu at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a nosferatu can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. A nosferatu cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a nosferatu's hit points to 0 incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay nosferatu. Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water deals an amount of damage to a nosferatu equal to one-third of its full normal hit points—a nosferatu reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed (If the base creature has a swim speed, the nosferatu is not harmed by running water.). Driving a wooden stake through a helpless nosferatu's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless its head is also severed and anointed with holy water.
