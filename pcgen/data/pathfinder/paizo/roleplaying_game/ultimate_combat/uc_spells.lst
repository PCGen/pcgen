While under the effect of this spell, you are immune to diseases and poisons with which you come into contact. When you are exposed to a disease or poison, you can choose to absorb it. Doing so ends the immunity due to this spell to any disease and poison other than the one you absorbed. You remain immune to the new affliction until this spell ends. Casting absorb toxicity on yourself a second time does not allow you to absorb a second toxin, but instead resets the duration of the effect to its full (CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes. While you have a disease or poison absorbed, you can use a melee touch attack to transfer that affliction to another creature. A missed attack does not discharge the spell, and you can try to transfer the affliction again in subsequent rounds. If you hit, this spell is discharged, and your target must make a saving throw against the transferred affliction (DC equal to this spell's save DC or the affliction's save DC, whichever is higher) or suffer its effect or initial effect immediately. The target then continues to suffer from the affliction's normal effects. If the spell's duration expires before you have transferred the affliction, you are exposed to any absorbed poison or disease as if you had transferred it to yourself, but you gain a +2 bonus on saves against that particular instance of the poison or disease.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																														FACT:CompMaterial|(a thorn from a poisonous plant)

While you are subject to this spell, you can take two 5-foot steps each round and still cast spells and use spell-like abilities without provoke attacks of opportunity. This spell automatically discharges as soon as you make an attack, cast a harmful spell against another creature, or move more than 5 feet with a single move action.

The air bubble allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage. A firearm within an air bubble can be loaded-assuming the black powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight protective device-and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the shot still takes the standard -2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to range.

If no unoccupied square is within range, the spell fails. The cannon comes into existence loaded. Each round thereafter, the cannon can either fire or load. A cannon must be loaded to fire. You do not need to supply ammunition for the cannon. On your turn, you can spend a move action to direct the cannon to wheel itself to a new location, moving the cannon up to 20 feet. If the arcane cannon ever leaves your line of sight, it winks out of existence, and the spell's duration ends. The cannon has a range increment of 50 feet. It targets touch attack in the first range increment, and it has no misfire chance. The cannon acts as a weapon with the conductive special weapon ability (see page 286 of the Advanced Player's Guide), which you can use to channel your spell-like or supernatural abilities as long as you are within the range of arcane cannon. The cannon's attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). On a hit, the cannon deals 4d10 damage. The arcane cannon attacks have a critical modifier of ?4. The cannon has AC 10, hardness 10, and 80 hit points. If the cannon is subject to a spell or effect that requires a save, it uses your saving throw modifiers. The cannon never provokes attacks of opportunity. If the cannon is destroyed, so is your focus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																														FACT:CompMaterial|(an ornate miniature cannon forged with a drop of your blood that costs 5,000 gp)

When you cast this spell, make an Intimidate check to demoralize each enemy within 30 feet of you (see page 99 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Enemies that are demoralized this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire.

The spell allows a shortbow to be used as a club or a longbow to be used as a quarterstaff, although the bow retains its normal hit points and hardness. The bow's enhancement bonus, if any, applies on melee attack and damage rolls.

When the target weapon hits a living creature, in addition to the normal effects of that hit, the wielder can discharge this spell as a free action to open a gash on the target's forehead that deals bleed damage equal to half your caster level. At the start of each of the target's turns, when it takes bleed damage, it also takes a cumulative -1 penalty on all attack rolls. When that penalty reaches -3, the target also treats all targets as having concealment (20%% miss chance). When the penalty reaches -5, the target is blinded. Stopping the bleed damage ends the effects this spell imposes on the bleeding creature. A target that is immune to bleed damage is also immune to all this spell's effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Caging Bomb Admixture								CLASSES:Alchemist=6												SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Force													COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You																DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds																						SOURCEPAGE:p.225	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/cagingBombAdmixture.html#_caging-bomb-admixture			DESC:Upon drinking an extract created with this formulae, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it creates an invisible cubical prison composed of a solid wall of force. The prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the area. Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless any creature within the splash radius is too big to fit inside, in which case the effect automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide means for escape, but the force walls extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like a wall of force, the cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists dispel magic, although a mage's disjunction still functions. The walls of the cage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys the cage. The walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per alchemist level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation instantly destroys this cage. When using caging bomb admixture, an alchemist can only have one cage in effect at a time. If the alchemist throws another bomb during the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created by the earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created. When the duration of the caging bomb admixture ends, so does any remaining cage created by this admixture's effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

This chain is a Medium object that has a 10-foot reach. Physical attacks cannot hit or harm the chain of perdition, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it normally. The chain's AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric). The chain can perform the dirty trick (blind or entangle), drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, using your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The chain does not provoke attacks of opportunity for making combat maneuvers. It suffers no penalty or miss chance due to darkness, invisibility, or other forms of concealment. As a move action, you can move the chain up to 30 feet. If the chain goes beyond the spell's range or out of your sight, it returns to you. If a creature that the chain attacks has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the chain performs a successful maneuver against that creature. If the chain is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																					FACT:CompMaterial|(chain link)

Once triggered, the symbol of striking glows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma modifier (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks. The symbol attacks any non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the symbol. However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must overcome that creature's spell resistance or be rendered unable to harm it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the creature to see the shadow nature of the attacks and take half damage when such attacks hit. Symbol of striking can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																													FACT:CompMaterial|(a masterwork melee weapon costing at least 300 gp)

Creatures in the area when the tar appears take 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum of 10d6) and must succeed at a Reflex save or become entangled. An entangled creature receives a saving throw each round to free itself from the tar, and can also attempt to free itself by spending a move action to attempt a Strength check or Escape Artist check (DC = spell saving throw DC). It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square in the area of effect, and the DC of Acrobatics checks within the area of effect increases by 5. The area is difficult terrain. A creature that moves into or starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must reattempt this Reflex save or become entangled. A creature that falls prone in the area takes a -4 penalty on its Reflex save against the tar and on Strength and Escape Artist checks to escape the tar. A creature that escapes the tar still takes fire damage from the tar until the spell ends or that creature spends a full-round action removing the tar.

This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw bombs, they can only hit a direct target; they do not splash.

While moving, your ally is flying just above the ground unless you wish otherwise. Movement from this spell provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, although you can lift your ally over objects or out of enemy reach, as long as your ally remains within this spell's range.

The held substance drains from its container into a magical sac in your body. While the spell lasts, you can deliver the substance with a mere touch. To do so to an opponent, you must make a successful melee touch attack. If you hit, the substance takes effect immediately, despite any onset period, and that opponent receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the substance. In the case of a personal infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude save and spell resistance. If you miss, the substance remains in the magical sac for you to use later. This spell protects you from poison in the sac, but unless you have the poison use class feature, you suffer a 5%% chance of exposing yourself to the poison when you first cast the spell.

This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a target directly, up to four vipers are released from the bomb. One viper attacks the target of the direct hit, and the other vipers attack up to three creatures that take damage from the splash damage. The vipers make melee touch attacks (using your base attack bonus + Intelligence modifier) and on a hit deal 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier damage, and the target is poisoned as if by a venomous snake (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 255).

It lunges at opponents, as if guided by a martially trained hand, parrying and turning back melee attacks aimed at you, but does not strike back at any opponent nor does it damage them. The weapon serves only as a defense. While it protects you, you can cast spells without provoking attacks of opportunity, without the need to cast them defensively. A creature with the Disruptive feat (Core Rulebook 122) can easily bypass this spell's defenses.

This spell is ineffective if no plants you can direct are within the area. You can spend a swift action and/or a standard action on each of your turns to direct one of the following attacks. The attack bonus or CMB for these attacks equals your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier. You grant a +1 bonus per three caster levels (maximum +5) on damage rolls due to this spell. Your wilderness soldiers never provoke attacks of opportunity, and they do not count as allies for flanking or other purposes. Tree - A tree makes a melee attack with a 10-foot reach from its trunk. A hit deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 points + your Wisdom modifier. The tree can instead attempt a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver with the same reach, but the tree cannot move itself. Undergrowth or Hedgerow - Acting as a Medium creature, one square of undergrowth or hedgerow attempts a grapple combat maneuver against an opponent within or adjacent to that square. Heavy undergrowth gains a +2 bonus to its CMD. Undergrowth cannot move the grapple or pin a foe, but it can deal an amount of damage equal to 1d4 points + your Wisdom modifier by making a successful grapple check against a foe it is grappling. The undergrowth's CMD is 5 + its CMB. If you fail to direct the undergrowth to maintain the grapple, it releases its opponent.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the warding weapon spell (see page 48). While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat (Core Rulebook 134) can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice. No matter the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers. No other type of weapons can serve as a focus for this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																												FACT:CompMaterial|(four mithral daggers, each worth at least 502 gp each)
