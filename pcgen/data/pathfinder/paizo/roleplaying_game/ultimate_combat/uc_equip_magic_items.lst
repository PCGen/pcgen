Dry Load Powder Horn								TYPE:Wondrous.Magic.Powder Horn	COST:2000			SOURCEPAGE:p.143	SPROP:This magical powder horn holds 20 doses of black powder. Furthermore, when a firearm is loaded with black powder directly from this horn, the horn creates a small pocket of air that envelops the gun and allows that shot to be fired underwater or in an area lacking air, such as a vacuum. Once the gun is loaded with powder from the dry load powder horn, it retains the pocket of air for 10 minutes or until the firearm is fired, whichever comes first. Firing a firearm that has been loaded from this horn underwater still incurs the -2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When a shot loaded from a dry load powder horn results in a firearm explosion while underwater or in an airless environment, that explosion occurs normally.
Far-Reaching Sight								TYPE:Wondrous.Magic			COST:4000	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.143	SPROP:This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm. When this is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon, but can be removed from that weapon with a full-round action. A firearm wielder can choose to spend a full-round action to make a single shot with a firearm that has this sight. When she does, she can resolve the attack against the touch AC of her target regardless of the range increment.
Figurine of Wondrous Power (Slate Spider)					TYPE:Wondrous.Magic			COST:10000			SOURCEPAGE:p.143	SPROP:This figure of wondrous power uses the same general rules for all magic items of this type (Core Rulebook 513). This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine spouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the activator, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming its activator. If commanded to do so as a free action, it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm. Each time the slate spider cleans a firearm, the next shot the firearm fires has no chance of misfiring. When animated, a slate spider has 1 hit point and is considered an attended object. An animated slate spider will never willingly leave space of its animator.
Oil (Of Silence)					OUTPUTNAME:Oil [NAME]	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic			COST:250			SOURCEPAGE:p.143	SPROP:When applied to a one-handed or two-handed firearm, this strange grayish oil renders that firearm silent for 1 hour. Five vials of oil of silence can be used in conjunction to silence a Large firearm siege engine, and 10 can be used to silence a Huge firearm siege engine. The oil does not work on firearm siege engines that are larger than Huge.
See Invisibility Sight								TYPE:Wondrous.Magic			COST:12000	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.143	SPROP:This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm. When this is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon, but can be removed from that weapon with a full-round action. A firearm wielder using a firearm that has this sight can choose to spend a full-round action to either locate an invisible creature within line of sight or make a single shot that ignores the invisibility of a creature that she knows is in the area.
