Scatter			KEY:Special Quality ~ Scatter ~ Firearm		NAMEOPT:NOTHING				TYPE:Ammunition.FirearmBullet.FirearmCartridge	COST:0	VISIBLE:NO	ITYPE:Scatter	SPROP:scatter																																																												SPROP:A weapon with the scatter weapon quality can shoot two different types of ammunition. It can fire normal bullets that target one creature, or it can make a scattering shot, attacking all creatures within a cone. Cannons with the scatter weapon quality only fire grapeshot, unless their descriptions state otherwise. When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within a cone, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature within the cone. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A firearm that makes a scatter shot misfires only if all of the attack rolls made misfire. If a scatter weapon explodes on a misfire, it deals triple its damage to all creatures within the misfire radius.
Sawback			KEY:Special Quality ~ Sawback ~ Sword									TYPE:Weapon.Blade								VISIBLE:QUALIFY				SOURCEPAGE:p.71														COST:5	PRETYPE:1,BladeLight,BladeHeavy																											SPROP:This is a modification to any light or heavy blade rather than a unique weapon type. The saw blade on the back of the sword lets you use it to perform crude carpentry.
Fragile			KEY:Special Quality ~ Fragile				NAMEOPT:NOTHING				TYPE:SpecialWeaponQualities				COST:0	VISIBLE:NO		ITYPE:Fragile	SOURCEPAGE:p.22																																													SPROP:Fragile weapons and armor cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Armor with the fragile quality falls apart when hit with heavy blows. If an attacker hits a creature wearing fragile armor with an attack roll of a natural 20 and confirms the critical hit (even if the creature is immune to critical hits), the armor gains the broken condition. If already broken, the armor is destroyed instead. Fragile armor is not broken or destroyed by critical threats that are not generated by natural 20s, so if a creature wielding a weapon with a 19-20 or 18-20 critical range scores a critical hit on the wearer of this armor with a roll of less than a natural 20, that critical hit has no chance to break or destroy the armor. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons and armor lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description|!PRETYPE:1,Masterwork,Enhancement
