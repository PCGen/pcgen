A piercing or slashing weapon that deals hit point damage to you is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save. A creature can pry off a stuck weapon on its turn as a standard action with a successful Strength check against the spell's DC. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive. The glue breaks down 5 rounds after you die, or when the duration ends. This glue has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Adhesive Spittle				CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1							SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation									COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:15 Ft.

This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spell's DC rather than a tanglefoot bag's normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

For example, you could make yourself look like a young human city guard, then an old elven wizard of the opposite gender, then a halfling thief, and so on. You can change the disguise a number of times equal to your caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

It has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. If it enters a space that contains a creature, the storm stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. It provides concealment (20%% miss chance) to anything within it, and its flickering light illuminates the same area a candle would. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (as a move action for you); otherwise, it stays at rest and crackles with lightning. It can be moved by wind effects and counts as a Small creature for the purpose of determining how winds affect it. The sphere has no physical substance and cannot exert any force on corporeal creatures or objects. It disperses if it exceeds the spell's range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																									FACT:CompMaterial|(a piece of a tree struck by lightning)

The first creature damaged by the cloud is also stunned for 1 round (Fortitude negates); this is a sonic effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									FACT:CompMaterial|(a piece of a tree struck by lightning)

If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of the air deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and hurls the target upward a number of feet equal to 5 x your caster level. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the target strikes the object in the same manner as it would during a normal fall. After this blast of air ceases, the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking falling damage as normal. A successful save means the target takes half damage from the air blast but is not moved by it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Air Step					CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Air						COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:you																							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes																													SOURCEPAGE:p.173	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/airStep.html	DESC:This spell functions as air walk, except you can rise no higher than 1 foot off the ground, you cannot pass over liquid, and the air you walk on is less stable than solid ground. When walking on air, you ignore difficult terrain that is less than 1 foot high, you do not trigger effects based on weight (such as a pressure plate), and any creature trying to track you through areas you crossed with this spell takes a -10 penalty on its Perception or Survival check to do so. However, because of the instability of the air you walk on, your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and you take a -4 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Ride checks. If you have 1 rank in Fly, your speed is not reduced when using this spell, and you can cross over liquid at half speed. If you have 5 ranks in Fly, you can cross liquid at full speed and do not take the penalties to your skill checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																												FACT:CompMaterial|(a goose feather)

Every group of up to 50 projectiles (which must be together at the time of casting) counts as one weapon for the purpose of dividing the spell's duration.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Alter Musical Instrument		CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1							SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Figment										COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:one musical instrument																				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (object)											SPELLRES:yes (object)				SOURCEPAGE:p.173	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/alterMusicalInstrument.html		DESC:You alter an instrument so it sounds like a different kind of instrument you are familiar with. The change could be minor (such as making a lute sound like a guitar) or major (making a keyboard sound like drums). All other aspects of the instrument-such as volume, pitch, and how it is played- are unchanged. For example, a piccolo made to sound like an organ is no louder than a normal piccolo, can produce only high notes in the piccolo range, and is a wind instrument.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			FACT:CompMaterial|(an instrument)
Anchored Step				CLASSES:Alchemist,Druid,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:you																							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]																												SOURCEPAGE:p.173	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/anchoredStep.html	DESC:Powerful tendrils grow out of the bottom of your feet or footwear, partially anchoring you to the ground and making it more difficult for others to move you against your will. These tendrils dig into any surface, but leave no trace of your passing. You gain a +10 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, overrun, pull, push, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, as well as any other effect that would move you from your current position (such as being swallowed whole) or knock you prone. The tendrils slow your movement, however; your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). This spell has no effect if you are moving without touching the ground (climbing, flying, swimming, and so on).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																																																												FACT:CompMaterial|(a bit of oak root)

This purpose supersedes the animal's previous trained purpose and any tricks it knows. When the spell ends, the animal reverts to its previous trained purpose and known tricks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			FACT:CompMaterial|(a swatch of black cloth)
Anonymous Interaction			CLASSES:Bard,Witch=2										SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart												DURATION:permanent [see text]							SAVEINFO:Will negates													SPELLRES:yes					SOURCEPAGE:p.174	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/anonymousInteraction.html	DESC:You cause the targets to forget all but the most general information about you. If they saw you or interacted with you, they still remember your presence and your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of your interactions with them (such as "She was asking about the queen"), but they don't remember specifically what you said, details of your appearance, or any identifying information about you. This spell targets any memories of you in the minute preceding its casting, but is otherwise permanent.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anti-Incorporeal Shell			CLASSES:Cleric,Shaman,Witch=4									SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:10 Ft.

This spell can be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura Sight					CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3|Inquisitor=4		SCHOOL:Divination														COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:you																							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]																													SOURCEPAGE:p.174	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/auraSight.html	DESC:This spell makes your eyes glow and allows you to see alignment auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect chaos/evil/good/law spell, but aura sight does not require concentration, and it discerns an aura's location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a creature's Hit Dice or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the detect evil spell. If an item or a creature bearing an aura is in line of sight, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to determine the aura's strength [one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a non-spell effect]. Aura sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Banshee Blast				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=6								SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Death|Fear|Mind-Affecting|Sonic	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 Ft.

Any creature that fails its Reflex save must succeed at a Will save or become panicked for 1 round/level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Barrow Haze					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Necromancy														COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high																	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes						SAVEINFO:none														SPELLRES:no						SOURCEPAGE:p.174	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/barrowHaze.html	DESC:Barrow haze creates a bank of fog similar to that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are black and they have a necromantic link to you. The vapors do not interfere with your vision. Because of your link to the haze, if any part of it is within 30 feet of you, any creatures within the haze count as in range for the purpose of using any of your hexes that have a maximum range of 30 feet. For example, suppose you have the slumber hex, you are 25 feet from one edge of the haze, and an opponent is 40 feet farther away at the other extreme of the cloud. You can use your slumber hex on that opponent even though it is actually 65 feet away from you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Beastspeak					CLASSES:Druid,Shaman,Witch=2									SCHOOL:Divination														COMPS:S, DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:you																							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes																													SOURCEPAGE:p.175	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/beastspeak.html	DESC:When you're in the form of an animal (such as when you are using wild shape or are affected by a polymorph effect), you can speak normally, including when you cast spells with verbal components, and you sound like your normal self when you speak. You can cast this spell while in animal form, using animal-appropriate somatic components.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bestow Auras				CLASSES:Antipaladin,Paladin=3									SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:one creature																						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)											SPELLRES:yes					SOURCEPAGE:p.175	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/bestowAuras.html		DESC:You transfer one or more of your paladin or antipaladin auras (such as aura of courage and aura of resolve) to another creature. You retain the personal effect of that aura, but the target becomes the center of the aura effect instead of you. For example, if you transfer your aura of courage, you remain immune to fear, but the target becomes the center of the aura that grants a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects. If an aura functions only when you are conscious, the transferred aura functions only when the target is conscious. If an aura functions only when you expend uses of another ability (such as with aura of justice or aura of vengeance), the transferred aura functions only if the target has that other ability and expends uses of it to activate the aura. You cannot transfer an aura that affects only you (such as aura of good).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

As part of casting this spell, you can use this weapon to attempt a trip combat maneuver against one creature within 20 feet, and you gain a +10 bonus on your roll, after which the weapon returns to its previous form.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Bow: The spell creates a longbow or shortbow appropriate for your size, and you are proficient in the use of this weapon. When drawn, the bow automatically creates a +1 seeking brilliant energy arrow; it cannot fire any other arrows. A creature struck by one of these arrows is surrounded by faerie fire and dazzled for 1 minute. This version of the spell ends when you have fired a number of arrows equal to your caster level. Bridge: The light forms a bridge or ramp 5 feet wide and up to 10 feet long per caster level. Creatures on the bridge are dazzled. Allies gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) on checks, saves, and to their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will. Enemies take a penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) checks, saves, and to their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																	FACT:CompMaterial|(a drop of rainwater)

Its unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage (target's choice). If the target already has this ability (such as from the monk unarmed strike ability or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat), its unarmed strikes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and they count as good-aligned weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bloatbomb					CLASSES:Antipaladin,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=4						SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Acid|Death					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:living creature touched																				DURATION:instantaneous and (CASTERLEVEL) minutes [see text]		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates or Reflex half (see text);								SPELLRES:yes					SOURCEPAGE:p.175	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/bloatbomb.html	DESC:The target creature dies if it fails a Fortitude saving throw and its Hit Dice are no more than half your caster level. If it dies, its corpse rapidly putrefies. The next creature to touch the corpse within 1 minute per level of the target's death causes the corpse to explode in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Each time you take at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, your armor gains a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. This enhancement bonus stacks with itself, but not with an existing enhancement bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +5. This spell has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blood Sentinel				CLASSES:Alchemist,Sorcerer,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:one animal sculpture																				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes						SAVEINFO:none														SPELLRES:no (harmless)				SOURCEPAGE:p.176	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/bloodSentinel.html	DESC:After casting this spell, you pour a few drops of your blood and saliva into the mouth of the animal sculpture material component, temporarily giving it life. The animal is bonded to you as if it were a familiar, and it has the abilities of a familiar (use your caster level as your effective wizard level to determine its abilities), but it does not grant you the Alertness feat or the special ability of its animal type. If your blood sentinel is slain, you take 2 points of Intelligence drain and the blood sentinel's body becomes a destroyed statue. This spell has no effect if you already have a familiar or another blood sentinel.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																																																																							FACT:CompMaterial|(a life-sized animal sculpture of a familiar made of clay, cloth, stone, or wood, plus mandrake root worth 25 gp)

It is therefore mainly used to protect against attacks on your turn, such as attacks of opportunity. If you move at least twice your speed on your turn, the blurring lasts until the start of your next turn.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You can release this stored electricity by making a melee touch attack. You gain a +3 bonus on the attack roll if your opponent is wearing metal armor, is carrying a metal weapon, or is made of metal. The target of your touch attack is dealt electricity damage equal to half the amount of electricity damage you took after you cast this spell (for example, if you saved for half damage against a lightning bolt and took only 15 points of electricity damage, your next touch attack deals 7 points of electricity damage). This spell is discharged once you hit with a melee touch attack to deliver its damage. If you take electricity damage multiple times while this spell is active, use the largest amount of electricity damage you took to determine your touch attack damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																								FACT:CompMaterial|(an iron coil)

The number of bullets protecting you is equal to half your caster level (maximum 4). When an opponent takes a shot at you with a firearm, as an immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet to attempt to block the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10. Doing this destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The spell is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness 20.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																																																																						FACT:CompMaterial|(one to four adamantine bullets, each worth 61 gp)

Those affected by this spell are able to see each other and themselves as if they were unaffected by the spell. If an affected creature moves out of the area, it loses the benefit of the spell. Creatures that move into the area after the spell is cast do not gain its benefit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Climbing Beanstalk			CLASSES:Druid,Witch=2										SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation									COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:5-ft. square of climbable beanstalks																		DURATION:instantaneous																															SOURCEPAGE:p.177	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/climbingBeanstalk.html	DESC:You cause a thick, sturdy beanstalk to sprout from the ground and grow upward to a height of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. The growing stalk anchors itself to sturdy objects such as walls or ceilings, and grows around objects that do not fully obstruct its square (such as tree branches), but is stopped by solid obstacles. The beanstalk provides numerous hand- and footholds; its climb DC 5. The beanstalk can support up to 200 pounds plus 50 pounds per caster level, or double that amount if anchored on its upper end. If it anchors itself to a sturdy mobile object (such as a ship or a siege engine), breaking the object free requires a DC 23 Strength check or cutting through the beanstalk (hardness 2, 40 hp). If the ground is capable of supporting plant life, the beanstalk continues to live as a normal plant, and it produces nutritious (if unappetizing) beans. Otherwise, the plant dies after 1d6 hours; its husk remains as durable as a small tree.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

At the time of casting, you dictate the condition, and the target specifies a readied action that occurs when triggered by this condition. The condition needed to trigger the readied action must be clear, although it can be general. If a complicated or convoluted condition is prescribed, the whole combination might fail when triggered. For example, suppose the trigger and the action are stated as "If the target is attacked while he is not holding a weapon, he draws a weapon." If the target has no weapon to draw when the trigger occurs, the action fails. If the trigger and the action are "If an ally within 20 feet falls unconscious, the target moves to a space adjacent to that ally" but the target is chained to a wall when the trigger occurs and can't reach the unconscious ally, the action fails. The readied action must be a standard, move, or swift action-it cannot be used to cast a spell or use a supernatural ability. This action counts as a readied action and doesn't count toward the number of actions the creature can take in a round. When the condition occurs, the target can decide not to use the readied action. Once the condition is triggered, the spell is discharged-whether or not the target uses the readied action or the action is successful. This spell counts as a contingency spell for the purpose of having multiple contingent effects on a creature at the same time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Casting this spell destroys the scroll, but allows the spell in it to be triggered in a manner similar to the contingency spell. The spell on the scroll must be a spell on your spell list, it must affect the target of this spell (the target of this spell is considered the caster of the scroll), and its level must be no higher than onefourth your caster level (maximum 5th level). The writing on the scroll appears on the target's skin in any location you desire; this writing does not harm or interfere with the target in any way, and doesn't need to be on exposed skin to function. For example, you could make the writing appear on under a target's clothing. The writing on the target's skin can be deciphered and identified as if it were the scroll it was copied from. Damaging the target has no effect on the stored spell, but effects such as erase that target magical writing can affect it. The condition needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although it can be general. In all cases, this spell immediately brings into effect the scroll's spell, the latter being effectively cast instantaneously when the trigger occurs. If a complicated or convoluted condition is prescribed, the whole spell combination (the contingent scroll and the scroll's spell) might fail when triggered. The scroll's spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to at that moment.

The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures to cross a body of water. Each 10-foot square of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the ice automatically. A section of ice whose hit points drop to 0 is destroyed, leaving an area of ice chunks, slush, and snow that counts as difficult terrain. If a creature tries to break through the ice with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + your caster level. Each round on your turn, the sheet of ice grows 1 foot in all directions except toward you. This growth is slow enough that any creature in the area has time to move out of the way or step onto the ice. If the growing ice completely covers a creature's square, the creature must choose whether it moves onto the sheet of ice, is knocked prone on the sheet of ice, or is bull rushed into an adjacent square.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The triggered hex uses this spell's caster level and DC. Read magic allows its caster to identify a hex glyph with a successful DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check.

For example, normally after you target a creature with a charm hex, you cannot target it again for 1 day. But after casting this spell on a creature, you could try the charm hex repeatedly as long as the spell persists. The end of this spell has no effect on any active or ongoing hex on a creature. For example, if the creature failed its save against a second use of your charm hex, it remains charmed for the normal duration, even if the spell expires before the hex does. Each subsequent casting of this spell on a target within a 24-hour period gives the target a +4 bonus on its save against the spell and imposes a -4 penalty on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance with this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																																																																											FACT:CompMaterial|(a drop of your blood)

This healing can prevent the triggering creature from dying, if the attack would cause the target's to have an amount of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score.

The target can visualize this page as easily as looking at it in person, including minute details visible to close scrutiny by the naked eye. The memory of the page includes text and images, such as a drawing or a map. Someone unfamiliar with the language on the page (or even an illiterate person) could relay what is written simply by copying the shapes of the letters so another person can read them. The maximum number of pages that a particular target can memorize through repeated castings of this spell is equal to the target's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); any attempts beyond this limit have no effect, although the target's memory of a page could be erased (using modify memory or a similar effect) to effectively make room for a different one. A creature that memorizes magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) cannot borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. However, this would allow a wizard to copy a spell into his spellbook so he could prepare the spell from his book (assuming the spell takes up only one page in a spellbook).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																																																																															FACT:CompMaterial|(the page to be memorized)

The creature is aware of the message and who the recipient is. Any attempt to speak, write, or otherwise communicate the message to anyone other than its intended recipient causes the target to forget the message for 1d6 minutes. Attempts to read the target's mind (such as with detect thoughts) or to force the target to reveal the message (such as with torture or magical compulsion) likewise cause temporary amnesia regarding the message. The target can communicate the message only to someone it believes is the intended recipient, which means that disguises, illusions, and polymorph effects might fool the target into delivering the message.

If the mirror is covered (such as by a cloth, or by being placed face down or against a wall), the portal becomes inactive. If the mirror is broken or moved more than 5 feet from where it was when you cast the spell, the spell ends; any creatures within the extradimensional space are expelled from it (see below) and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the space can see and hear through it as if looking through an open window the same size as the mirror. Creatures outside the extradimensional space see only what is normally reflected in the mirror. Any creature in the space can make itself visible in the reflection of the mirror for 1 round at a time, however creatures outside the space cannot hear any sounds that originate inside. Anything inside the extradimensional space is expelled when the spell ends (even if the mirror is covered). Only one creature at a time can enter the mirror, and creatures can enter only if they can fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. For example, a hand mirror isn't big enough for a Small or larger creature to use it as a portal.

The spell's range must reach any square within 10 feet of the haunt's area. You must be aware of the haunt prior to casting the spell, and casting the spell does not trigger the haunt. You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The haunt's knowledge is limited to what its original creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke. A haunt often remembers the circumstance that led to its existence (though this recollection might be from the original victim's perspective and therefore not objective), what triggers it, and how it can be laid to rest (destroyed). Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the haunt is angry and vindictive. If the haunt's alignment is more than one step away from yours, the haunt can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A haunt's Will save modifier is equal to 3 + the haunt's CR. If the save is successful, the haunt can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you (using Bluff). A haunt's Bluff modifier equals its CR (minimum +0) or might be determined by the GM based upon the original victim. The haunt can speak only about what it knew in life and the circumstances by which it became a haunt. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after it was created. A neutral or good haunt might cooperate with similarly aligned creatures in order to end its suffering. If a haunt has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell on it fails. You can cast this on a haunt that has been deceased for any amount of time. Unlike a corpse affected by speak with dead, a haunt wants to express itself, if only to share its pain or to cause mischief.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, it loses one of its available 3rd-level spell slots; if the target has no available 3rd-level spell slots, it must lose a 2nd-level spell slot (progressing down to 1st-level spell if it has no 2ndlevel spell slots available). If the target has more than one spellcasting class, choose one at random to be affected. This spell has no effect on spell-like abilities.

TARGETAREA:whiplike swarm																					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D [see text]]				SAVEINFO:none														SPELLRES:yes					SOURCEPAGE:p.199	SOURCELINK:http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedClassGuide/spells/whipOfSpiders.html	DESC:You summon hundreds of Diminutive spiders, which cling together in the form of a whip made for a creature of your size. You can wield this object as if it were an actual whip, except you make a melee touch attack with it instead of a regular attack. Any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction, Bestiary 258). The swarm whip is able to damage creatures with armor or natural armor, even if a normal whip could not. It cannot be used to make bull rush, grapple, or trip attacks, and (unlike a swarm) is subject to a miss chance for concealment and cover. The whip is immune to all weapon damage, is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage, and is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). The whip takes half again as much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving throw on a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent. The whip does not have a swarm's susceptibility to high winds. As a standard action, you can transform the whip into a spider swarm (all squares of the swarm must be within 15 feet of you); thereafter it functions as summon swarm. The spider swarm has 3 hit points and persists in that form for 2 rounds or until the end of this spell's duration, whichever comes first.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell																																																							FACT:CompMaterial|(a square of red cloth)

It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-5. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell. A summoned Nature's Ally cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components [such as wish]. When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10-5 marked with an "*" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an "*" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. [Table Not Included]|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
