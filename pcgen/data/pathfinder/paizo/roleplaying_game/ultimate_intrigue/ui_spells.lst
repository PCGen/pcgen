Absolution					CLASSES:Cleric,Paladin=4																		SCHOOL:Abjuration																TYPE:Divine					COMPS:V,S,M,DF	CASTTIME:1 round								RANGE:Medium						TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																DURATION:Instantaneous													SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.203		DESC:You purge impure thoughts from the target's mind and fill him with exultant relief at the forgiveness of his sins. Absolution ends all charm or compulsion effects affecting the target (including harmless compulsions, such as heroism) as per break enchantment. If the target was forced to perform any actions contrary to his alignment, monk vows, paladin oath, or similar code of conduct by that charm or compulsion effect, that action doesn't cause him to lose access to class abilities, including divine spellcasting. Unlike an atonement spell, absolution can't reverse alignment change or the effects of willing transgressions, induce a creature to change its alignment, or restore class abilities lost because of misdeeds performed in the past. Absolution automatically works if the caster and the target share the same alignment or the same patron deity. If they don't, but their alignments are within one step of each other, absolution has a %1%% chance of success. If neither of these is true, the spell automatically fails. If using the honor subsystem, casting absolution also eliminates the honor loss for events and actions committed by the target while he was affected by a charm or compulsion effect that the spell ended. Material component; vial of holy water.|CASTERLEVEL*5|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aerial Tracks				CLASSES:Ranger=3|Druid,Inquisitor,Shaman=4															SCHOOL:Divination								DESCRIPTOR:Air						TYPE:Divine					COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium						TARGETAREA:Circle centered on you, with a radius of (100+(CASTERLEVEL*10)) feet								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours												SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.203		DESC:You cause the air in the area to ripple where creatures have flown through it up to %1 days ago. These aerial ripples are tinged by glowing wisps, providing enough illumination to follow the tracks without penalties due to poor lighting. The area moves with you, allowing you to follow the tracks through the air over long distances provided you can fly or follow the route along the ground within range to read the aerial tracks. Other creatures can also follow the trail as long as they move with you. The base DC of Survival checks to track creatures through the air with this spell is the same as tracking creatures across soft ground.|CASTERLEVEL|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animal Ambassador				CLASSES:Ranger=3|Bard,Druid,Shaman=4																SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One Medium or smaller animal															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days or until message is delivered							SAVEINFO:None; see text											SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.204		DESC:You compel a single animal to travel to a spot you designate and deliver a message to a creature you identify. This spell is similar to animal messenger, but can affect larger animals. In addition, the target animal is temporarily awakened to sentience (as the awaken spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The awakened target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in certain skills.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aphasia					CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1													SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds												SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text									SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.204		DESC:You render the target unable to understand any language, including spoken language, written language, sign language, gestures attempting to mimic a crude language, or even truespeech and telepathy. The affected creature is unable to communicate, use command words, cast spells with verbal components, or use any other abilities that requires language. At the end of each of its turns, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. Tongues counters and dispels aphasia, and a creature with the tongues spell active is immune to aphasia. Oracles with the tongues curse ignore aphasia in combat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Audiovisual Hallucination		CLASSES:Medium=2|Bard,Magus,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long							TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30ft. apart								DURATION:Concentration + 3 rounds											SAVEINFO:Will disbelief											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.204		DESC:You cause the targets to believe they hear any sound you imagine. The sound can include intelligible speech. Instead of precisely imagining a sound, you can identify a sound the subjects know and they imagine it doing what you describe as you cast the spell. You can include the image of any object, creature, or force you imagine or identify for the targets to imagine. You can change the sound or move the image while you concentrate. After you cease concentration, you can define simple movements or changes for the phantasm to perform that can be explained in 25 words or fewer. The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately or instruct it to do so. Its AC is equal to 10 + the level of this spell. All targets experience the same hallucination.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Auditory Hallucination			CLASSES:Bard,Magus,Medium,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=1											SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long							TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30ft. apart								DURATION:Concentration + 3 rounds											SAVEINFO:Will disbelief											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.204		DESC:You cause the targets to believe they hear any sound you imagine. The sound can include intelligible speech. Instead of precisely imagining a sound, you can identify a sound the subjects know and they imagine it doing what you describe as you cast the spell. All targets hear the same hallucination. You can change the sound as part of concentrating on the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura of the Unremarkable		CLASSES:Medium=2|Bard,Mesmerist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4												SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:30 ft.						TARGETAREA:Non-allied creatures within a 30-ft. emanation												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D] and instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.204		DESC:An invisible sphere of magic surrounds you, clouding the minds of creatures in the area so they regard even the strangest actions as innocuous. For example, if you and your allies are beating a member of the city guard for information, creatures within the area don't think this is unusual or cause for alarm; if your ally is aiming a crossbow at the queen from a balcony, the affected creatures accept this as normal and unworthy of concern. Any hostile actions by you or your allies against a creature or its allies break the effect of the spell for that creature. When the spell ends (or when the affected creatures move outside of the range of the emanation), observers see things normally but altered perceptions from the earlier events remain. Each mention of the events as noteworthy (such as being questioned about them by an authority figure) allows the target another Will save to break the effect and remember things normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bountiful Banquet				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Shaman=4																	SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Creation										TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:Feast for (CASTERLEVEL*2) creatures														DURATION:1 hour; see text												SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.205		DESC:You conjure a beautiful and delicious feast with hors d'oeuvres, four courses worth of food, and plentiful drink. The food appears on ornate serving trays or in exquisite covered tureens, as appropriate to each type of dish. Place settings and serving utensils also appear—enough for each creature that will participate in the feast—along with elegant tablecloths and table linens. The spell doesn't create furniture, but the feast does adapt to appear on top of existing tables (or similar objects in the environment). Though the feast and all the finery last only 1 hour, creatures that partake remain nourished and sated for 24 hours.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Break (Greater)				CLASSES:Bloodrager=4|Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=6													SCHOOL:Transmutation															TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 round								RANGE:30 ft.						TARGETAREA:All Medium or smaller objects in a 30-ft. burst centered on you									DURATION:Instantaneous													SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:Yes (object)		SOURCEPAGE:p.205		DESC:You release a burst of destructive energy. Each Medium or smaller object in the area gains the broken condition unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. If a broken object fails this save, it is instead destroyed. Magic items can be broken by this spell, but not destroyed. Objects in your possession are not immune. Material component; an unbroken platinum tuning fork worth 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Build Trust					CLASSES:Paladin=1|Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Mesmerist,Psychic=2												SCHOOL:Divination																TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days; see text										SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.205		DESC:You get a sense of the best way to interact with the target in order to encourage positive regard and fellowship toward you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks you attempt when interacting with the target. In addition, whenever you fail a Charisma check or Charisma-based skill check when interacting with the target, you can reroll the check as an immediate action. Attempting this reroll grants the target a new saving throw to end the spell. The target doesn't become hostile to you when the spell ends, but it does become disillusioned of its new trust in you. Attacking the target or taking an obvious hostile action against it automatically ends the spell. If you are using the contacts rules, your trust score with the target increases by 1 for the duration of the spell. If you're using the individual influence system (see pages 102–109), if the target fails its initial saving throw you learn one of its influence skills, strengths, or weaknesses as though you had succeeded at a discovery check. Material component; one gold piece.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Charm Person (Mass)			CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist,Occultist=4|Psychic,Shaman,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Charm			DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One or more humanoid creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours												SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.206		DESC:This spell functions like charm person, except that mass charm person affects a number of humanoid creatures whose combined Hit Dice don't exceed %1. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you reach the limit of HD you can affect. If you cast mass charm person on only one creature, you ignore the spell's HD limit.|CASTERLEVEL*2|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Codespeak					CLASSES:Bard,Medium,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=2												SCHOOL:Transmutation															TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:You plus (CASTERLEVEL/2) willing creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.206		DESC:Upon casting this spell, all recipients gain the ability to speak a new language. This language sounds like random, babbling syllables to anyone not under the influence of the spell, but the targets understand each other perfectly. Anyone using codespeak can read and write in this new language as well. Once the spell expires, however, any coded writing suddenly appears as gibberish. If the exact same group of individuals become the targets of a codespeak spell again, cast by the same caster, they can once again read any coded writings. A dedicated codebreaker can crack such writing's code, deciphering it one page at a time with a series of DC 30 Linguistics checks. Comprehend languages doesn't enable a caster to understand the language of another's codespeak spell, but it does reveal that the targets are speaking a magical language. Tongues translates codespeak normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Complex Hallucination			CLASSES:Medium=3|Bard,Magus,Mesmerist,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4									SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long							TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30ft. apart								DURATION:Concentration + 3 rounds											SAVEINFO:Will disbelief											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.206		DESC:You cause the targets to believe they hear any sound you imagine. The sound can include intelligible speech. Instead of precisely imagining a sound, you can identify a sound the subjects know and they imagine it doing what you describe as you cast the spell. You can include the image of any object, creature, or force you imagine or identify for the targets to imagine. You can also include olfactory, tactile, and thermal effects. You can change the effects while you concentrate. After you cease concentration, you can define simple movements or changes for the phantasm to perform that can be explained in 25 words or fewer. The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately or instruct it to do so. Its AC is equal to 10 + the level of this spell. All targets experience the same hallucination.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Compulsive Liar				CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist=1|Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2													SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch							TARGETAREA:Creature touched																	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]											SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.206		DESC:The target becomes unable to speak the truth. Lies the target speaks don't need to be convincing, nor do they even need to be consistent, but they can't be true as far as the target is aware. This extends to non-verbal communication, such as hand signs or written notes. The spell allows talking in metaphors and talking about fictional figures. The spell doesn't affect the target's ability to say things that are neither true nor false, such as questions, commands, or verbal spell components. If the target of this spell is simultaneously compelled to tell the truth (for instance, by being within a zone of truth), the target is only able to say things that are neither true nor false.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Conditional Curse				CLASSES:Medium,Mesmerist=3|Antipaladin,Cleric,Inquisitor,Occultist,Shaman,Witch=4|Psychic,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Wizard=5		SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Curse						TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:Permanent; see text												SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.206		DESC:This spell functions as bestow curse, except that you must state a condition under which the curse is broken, ending its effect. An intelligent target, even one of animal intelligence, innately understands this condition even if it doesn't understand your language. The condition must be possible for the target to bring about within a year and a day without ensuring its own death and stated in 25 or fewer words. The curse is more difficult to remove via magic. The DC to remove conditional curse with break enchantment or remove curse increases by 5.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Conditional Favor				CLASSES:Antipaladin,Paladin=1|Bard,Cleric,Inquisitor,Mesmerist,Occultist,Witch=2									SCHOOL:Abjuration																TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 swift action							RANGE:See text						TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days [D]											SAVEINFO:None; see text											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.206		DESC:You must cast this spell immediately before casting another spell on the same creature, eliciting a promise or warning against a behavior and binding the target to the paired spell. If you don't cast a paired spell, conditional favor has no effect. The paired spell must be from the abjuration, conjuration (healing), enchantment, or transmutation school or subschool, and must be cast on a willing creature. If the spell's recipient violates the oath or prohibition while conditional favor remains in effect, the paired spell is undone as if never cast. If the spell was a healing spell, the hit point damage or condition you removed returns immediately, even if the subject has enjoyed subsequent rest or healing. Poisons, diseases, curses, restored ability damage, and negative levels removed by the paired spell return as well. Conditional favor recognizes the spirit of your condition and doesn't trigger a violation due to unintended consequences or circumstances that the subject could not predict with her current knowledge of the situation. For instance, if the prohibition prevented the subject from laying a finger on royalty, touching a disguised prince would not count as a violation if the subject did not recognize the prince, nor would touching a member of royalty while dominated. The subject of the spell intuitively knows beforehand whether an action will cause it to lose the paired spell's benefit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Conjuration Foil				CLASSES:Magus,Summoner=3|Bard,Medium,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Spiritualist,Witch,Wizard=4							SCHOOL:Abjuration																TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:S		CASTTIME:1 immediate action						RANGE:Medium						TARGETAREA:20-foot radius spread																DURATION:1 round														SAVEINFO:Will half; see text										SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.207		DESC:All creatures in the area gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against teleportation effects. If any creature would enter or depart the area via a summoning or teleportation effect, that creature takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the triggering effect (or half the HD of the originating creature if the effect has no spell level) and arrives in a random similar location within the triggering effect's range, rather than the intended destination. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the altered destination.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Conjure Carriage				CLASSES:Bard,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=3														SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Creation										TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 round								RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One quasi-real carriage, horses, and driver												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.207		DESC:You create a fine wooden carriage with whatever cosmetic embellishments you desire. It is well constructed, although not exceptionally ostentatious. The carriage can carry up to six Medium or Small passengers. When conjured, the carriage comes with a team of two quasi-real light horses, which are already harnessed to the carriage. At your command, an invisible coachman similar to an unseen servant can assume the role of driver and direct the carriage, although it can't perform any complex or dangerous driving, and fails any checks made to drive the carriage in such conditions. At the end of the spell's duration, the carriage, horses, and coachman disappear into nothingness, depositing everything on or in it on the ground in its space.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Contingent Venom				CLASSES:Shaman,Sorcerer,Wizard=4																	SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Poison						TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch							TARGETAREA:One dose of poison or one venomous creature												DURATION:Permanent until discharged [D]										SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates										SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.208		DESC:This spell functions as languid venom, but you can stipulate a specific condition or circumstance that will end the poison's onset time and cause it to take effect. The conditions for triggering the poison can be as general or as detailed as desired, but the triggers must be visual or audible (as per magic mouth) or else based on physical contact with or consumption of a specific object, substance, or creature. This triggering condition can either result in the immediate onset of the poison, or cause the poison to take effect a number of rounds after being triggered no greater than %1 rounds. You must make all decisions involving triggering when you cast contingent venom, and you can't change those decisions later.|CASTERLEVEL|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Controlled Fireball			CLASSES:Bloodrager,Magus,Occultist,Sorcerer,Wizard=4														SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Fire|Ruse					TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long							TARGETAREA:20-foot radius spread																DURATION:Instantaneous													SAVEINFO:Reflex half											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.208		DESC:This spell functions as fireball except you can cause the bead of fire to originate from anywhere you can see within range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC: You can choose %1 squares within the area to be struck by weaker flames; the controlled fireball deals minimum damage in those squares.|INT|PRECLASS:1,Magus=10,Occultist=10,Wizard=7|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC: You can choose %1 squares within the area to be struck by weaker flames; the controlled fireball deals minimum damage in those squares.|CHA|PRECLASS:1,Bloodrager=13,Sorcerer=8|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC: Attempts to identify controlled fireball with a skill check incorrectly identify it as fireball.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crime of Opportunity			CLASSES:Antipaladin,Mesmerist=1																	SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Divine.Psychic			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:1 round														SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.208		DESC:You instill overwhelming avarice in the target and impel them toward a wild spree of larceny. A creature affected by crime of opportunity must roll percentile dice to determine what action they take. 1–25 - Act normally, but with suspicion toward others. (No benefit from teamwork feats, aid another; 50%% to avoid receiving harmless spells). 26–50 - Attempt to steal form nearest creature (slight of hand or combat maneuver), then flee.  51–75 - Attempt to break or vandalize nearest unattended manufactured object or structure. 76–100 - Attack the nearest creature. A character affected by crime of opportunity who is unable to carry out the indicated action moves toward the nearest source of cover or concealment and attempts a Stealth check to hide. An affected creature with the ability to turn invisible (including through the use of magic items or spells) does so instead of attempting a Stealth check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crime Wave					CLASSES:Antipaladin=4|Bard,Mesmerist=5|Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=7												SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium						TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures, no two of which can be more than 30ft. apart								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]											SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.208		DESC:You instill overwhelming avarice in the targets and impel them toward a wild spree of larceny. Creatures affected by a crime wave must roll percentile dice each round to determine what action they take. 1–25 - Act normally, but with suspicion toward others. (No benefit from teamwork feats, aid another; 50%% to avoid receiving harmless spells). 26–50 - Attempt to steal form nearest creature (slight of hand or combat maneuver), then flee.  51–75 - Attempt to break or vandalize nearest unattended manufactured object or structure. 76–100 - Attack the nearest creature. A character affected by a crime wave who is unable to carry out the indicated action moves toward the nearest source of cover or concealment and attempts a Stealth check to hide. Affected creatures with the ability to turn invisible (including through the use of magic items or spells) do so instead of attempting a Stealth check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cultural Adaptation			CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Medium,Occultist,Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=1												SCHOOL:Divination																TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal						TARGETAREA:You																			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes																														SOURCEPAGE:p.208		DESC:When casting this spell, you must concentrate on a culture or subculture to which you wish to adapt. If you speak the native language of the culture in question, then for the duration of this spell, you speak the language with a native accent. The spell doesn't teach you the language in question, but can be combined with tongues or a similar spell. Your body language and gestures mark you as a native of the culture, and you unconsciously make small decisions that help you blend in. Combined, these grant you a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence members of the culture to which you have adapted, which doesn't stack with other circumstance bonuses you might possess by virtue of being a member of the chosen culture. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to pass yourself off as if you were a member of the culture, if you are not. This doesn't provide benefits when disguising yourself as a specific member of the culture, though it negates any circumstance penalties you might otherwise have taken due to not acting appropriately for that person's culture. Finally, the DCs of enchantment (charm) spells you cast against natives of the culture to which you are attuned increase by 1.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Curse of the Outcast			CLASSES:Bard,Inquisitor,Mesmerist=4|Cleric,Shaman,Witch=6													SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Curse|Emotion|Mind-Affecting		TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:Permanent													SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.209		DESC:Everything about the target seems off-putting and grating, and everyone he meets is compelled to see the worst in him. Whenever the target attempts a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform check, he must roll twice and take the lower result. Additionally, each creature he encounters has its initial attitude toward him reduced by one step (helpful becomes friendly, friendly becomes indifferent, and so on).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dark Whispers				CLASSES:Antipaladin=1|Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=2											SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Shadow			DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent|Shadow		TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,F/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long							TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creatures																DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.209		DESC:You communicate through the shadows of one or more targets within range. The shadows have no physical presence and don't move or animate. Instead, your words emerge from the shadow as a clear whisper, absent any accent or other identifying features. The targets can make conversation with the shadow, but must speak aloud to do so. The targets' voices emerge from your own shadow only when they intend to speak to the shadow, but you hear no other sounds from the target's immediate area. Their responses also emerge as clear whispers, absent identifying features, but you can instinctively identify which target is speaking to you through the shadow. Once the spell has been cast, you don't need to have line of effect to the targets or their shadows to communicate back and forth. The shadow communication is audible, so it can be intercepted by adversaries who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check. The spell can be silenced. You can't cast spells on subjects or otherwise establish line of effect through the shadows, but spells that allow you to speak or understand languages work normally across dark whispers.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deadman's Contingency			CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Psychic,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4														SCHOOL:Evocation																TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S,M,F	CASTTIME:10 minutes or more; see text				RANGE:Personal						TARGETAREA:You																			DURATION:Up to (CASTERLEVEL) hours plus 1d6 rounds [D]; see text																									SOURCEPAGE:p.210		DESC:This spell functions as contingency, except as noted. This spell also only comes into effect after your death and works only with certain spells. The companion spell triggers 1d6 rounds after your death. All decisions made involving the companion spell must be made when deadman's contingency is cast (including messages and recipients for spells like magic mouth or sending). If the spell targets an object or appears in a certain location, it must target or be centered on your corpse. The following spells can be companion spells for deadman's contingency: animate dead (animating your corpse as an uncontrolled skeleton or zombie), disintegrate, fireball, gentle repose, magic mouth, major image (with a duration of 3 rounds), permanent image, sending, stinking cloud, and teleport object. Focus; ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deceitful Veneer				CLASSES:Antipaladin,Medium=3|Bard,Inquisitor,Mesmerist,Psychic=4|Witch=5										SCHOOL:Illusion			SUBSCHOOL:Glamer											TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]											SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.210		DESC:You subtly alter both the target's aura and subtle cues in its body language, tone of voice, and word choice, which makes everything that the target says seem to be a lie. Every statement that the target makes appears to be a lie under both magical scrutiny (such as discern lies) and mundane scrutiny (such as using the Sense Motive skill). Someone who closely scrutinizes the target can determine when it is actually telling the truth with a successful Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + your caster level). As long as you are within close range of the target, as a standard action you can suppress or resume the effects of this spell, allowing you to let the target seem to be telling the truth at some times and still seem to be lying at others.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deflect Blame				CLASSES:Bard,Mesmerist,Psychic=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=3														SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 immediate action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:One creature																		DURATION:Instantaneous													SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.210		DESC:You can cast this spell immediately after attacking a creature, causing that creature to believe that a different creature that threatens it was responsible for the attack rather than you.

The spell conjures such an object near your hand such that you can retrieve it as you complete the spell. No matter what sort of object you picked, it functions as a one-handed improvised weapon appropriate for your size and that deals 1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature (1d4 for Small creatures). The item deals the type of damage you choose (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) when casting the spell, though the object you request must conform to the damage type. The spell ends prematurely if the improvised weapon leaves your grasp. The object has no value and can't be used for other functions other than as an improvised weapon (for instance, this spell doesn't allow you to conjure an expensive spyglass and sell it or use its other abilities, but you could still use it to beat someone over the head). The conjured object can't already be a manufactured weapon, even in a location where you might expect to see manufactured weapons. It can be an object that would normally make for an unusual improvised weapon, like a herring at a fish market, and it still deals its full damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped emanation																DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]							SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.212		DESC:This spell functions as detect magic, except that you can glean much more information from the magical auras that you find, and those auras can be found after a much greater length of time. You can detect a lingering aura for up to %1 days, regardless of the aura's original strength. Additionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell's area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster's aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 + the creature's caster level. Finally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it. In order to find these identifiers in a spell's aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge (arcana) check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them). Once you learn a caster's set of identifiers, you can remember them as easily as a face or a voice. You can recognize this signature if you succeed at a Spellcraft check when later identifying a spell to determine whether or not that spell was cast by the same individual. The spell greater magic aura can obfuscate this information, making it seem that someone else cast the spell. Greater detect magic grants a saving throw against magic aura (but not greater magic aura).|CASTERLEVEL|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped emanation																DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]							SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.212		DESC:You can detect other worshipers of your deity (mortal worshipers, outsider servants, and so on). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you focus on a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of the faithful. 2nd Round: Number of individual faithful in the area. 3rd Round: The exact location of each worshiper. If a fellow worshiper is outside your line of sight, then you discern his direction but not his exact location. Each round, you can rotate to detect worshipers in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. A creature's personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as you—hence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. Furthermore, since the spell picks up a creature's current beliefs and feelings, a creature actively pretending to be member of the same faith also appears to the spell to be a member. Thus, the spell is still useful in locating potential hidden members of the same faith among the general populace, but on its own, it doesn't weed out spies.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

This spell can hide or create telltale wounds, bruising, and other subtle clues as to the nature of the target's death, and the final hours leading up to it, allowing you to make the corpse appear to have died in just about any way. You could, for example, make stab wounds close up as though they were never there, rearrange bruises on the neck, evaporate traces of poison within the body into nothingness, make burn marks grow to cover the corpse's skin, or shrivel the target's body as though the creature had starved. This spell can't hide extreme alterations to the body (such as the loss of a limb), nor can it restore flesh to a skeletal corpse or strip a corpse down to skeletal form. It is also unable to change the apparent identity of the corpse. Anyone who closely examines the corpse can attempt a Perception check (DC %1) to notice that the corpse's wounds (or lack thereof) don't look natural, but this doesn't allow the observer to determine what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast.

Like lesser planar ally, this spell is unpredictable, and the fey who answers the calling is up to the whims of nature and the fey, not your own choice. You must succeed at a Knowledge (nature) check or Perform check (DC = 20 + target's HD) in addition to the spell's material component to entice the fey into appearing, after which you can negotiate for the service and your payment. The maximum HD of fey that you can call with that casting is equal to the result of your check – 20. For example, if your check result is a 24, the maximum HD for the called fey is 4. A high result doesn't allow you to break the HD maximum for the spell, and a result of 20 or less means you can't call a fey at all. If the fey doesn't like the sound of your offer, it can simply choose to refuse, in which case you don't expend any of the material components for the spell, either the offerings or the payment.

Instead of the target's true actions or experiences, divinations resolve as if the target will experience some different future you describe as you cast false future.

If you fail to overcome the subject's spell resistance, the subject's soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to life (as resurrection) in the restored body. The possession otherwise functions (as possession) except that the subject's soul is not present to resist. When false resurrection ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn't been returned to life already, it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as resurrection). If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead. Attempts to identify false resurrection with a skill check incorrectly identify it as resurrection.

The spell can be cast at any distance. The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. The target gains the same bonuses and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties that apply to the scrying spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another plane). The illusion created by the spell moves with the target, and is not stationary. The image can affect the way the target is perceived, the way the target's surroundings are perceived, and the way that specific creatures or objects around the target are perceived. For the target, and any other specific creatures or objects you specify, you can cause them to appear as other creatures or objects that you designate, not to appear at all, or to have their appearance unaltered. For the target's surroundings, you can choose to make the target appear to be somewhere else, either a specific location with which you are familiar, or a generic location conjured from your imagination. You can change the way that the spell affects the appearance of any of these things by concentrating on the spell. You can also cause creatures or objects to appear in the illusion that are not really there, or to make a creature or object seem to act in a way other than it is actually acting. In this case, you must concentrate on the spell, or these aspects of the illusion simply remain static. The spell can provide visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal sensations as needed.

You link the intangible item to the target's flesh by making a brand shaped like the item on the target's skin. The intangible item merges with the target's flesh and is contained within the target's body, moving with the target wherever it goes. The creature can retrieve the item or reabsorb it as a full-round action, and can do so as many times as it wants. When worn or wielded by the target, the item regains its solidity and functions normally, though the target can't drop or remove the item (other than by using the full-round action), nor can it be disarmed or stolen. If the item is destroyed, the spell ends. If the ghost brand spell is dispelled while the object is inside the target's body, the object bursts out of the target's flesh, dealing 3d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to the target that bypasses DR, as well as 1d6 points of bleed damage.

For example, an insect is unable to relay someone's emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge. Each insects' size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20, a move and climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a Perception skill bonus of %1, and can't make attacks. They can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a Stealth skill bonus of %2. The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of +0 for Huge or larger creatures). You also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are. As a full-round action, you can concentrate on the spell in order to learn the direction and relative distance of each of the insects.|(CASTERLEVEL/2)+5|(CASTERLEVEL/2)+18|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The illusion appears to be a perfect replica. Actively examining the fake with an Appraise or Perception check grants a creature a Will save, but on a failed saving throw, it concludes that the fake is the genuine article. The illusion isn't a functional item, nor does it have any magical properties of the original. For example, an instant fake of a set of thieves' tools can't be used to pick a lock, a false warhammer can't harm a person or break an object, a suit of unreal chainmail offers no actual protection, and an illusory potion of cure light wounds doesn't heal any hit points when imbibed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The target is able to identify noble individuals, noble family names, and noble crests, signets, heraldry, and other symbols. The target treats her number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility) as though it were equal to your number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility), to a maximum of 5 ranks and a minimum of 0. If the target's number of ranks is greater than yours, she uses her own number of ranks instead.

(You touch the poison's container, so you don't risk exposing yourself to a contact poison.) The target doesn't attempt a saving throw when initially exposed to the languid venom, but instead saves at the end of the poison's onset time. If the poison is neutralized or otherwise cured prior to the end of its onset time, it is rendered harmless. Failing saves against multiple doses of languid venom have the normal cumulative effect for poisons. Languid venom is difficult to detect or identify. Detect poison and similar effects detect languid venom only with a successful caster level check (DC %2; rolled secretly by the GM). Even if the poison is detected, the DC of Craft (alchemy) or Wisdom checks to identify the poison is increased by 10. If a poison is affected by an additional effect that requires a caster level check to detect the poison or increases the DC to identify it—such as obscure poison—those effects don't stack. Use only the caster level check with the higher DC and increase the DC of the check to identify the poison by the higher of the two. If cast upon a venomous creature, languid venom delays the onset of that creature's poison when the creature next delivers its natural poison.

The target neither gains nor provides benefit from teamwork feats or the aid another action and can't willingly accept harmless magical effects from others. The target moves by Stealth whenever possible, and lies and deceives others instinctively to further its personal agenda. In addition, when the target is conscious, it must succeed at a Will save against the spell's save DC each hour (or each round during combat or a similarly stressful situation) or behave as if affected by a crime wave spell for 1 round. Life of crime is particularly difficult to remove.

By default, the spell targets every creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or greater that is within the spell's range, but at your discretion, you can choose to restrict the spell to certain creatures, causing it to either only deliver its message to creatures meeting a certain criteria, or to deliver it to all creatures except those meeting that criteria. The criteria must be something objective and observable. For example, you could cause the mage's decree to reach only creatures of a certain race. You can't choose recipients that rely on unobservable information, such as creatures of a certain alignment or of a particular class. You can't pick and choose individual creatures to target or exclude. While the spell's range defaults to %1 miles, you can choose to reduce it to a smaller radius, although the spell's area can't be shaped. The nature of the spell prevents the message it carries from having any magical power; the message can't be used to transmit spells or abilities that are conveyed via speech. The message is transmitted in your voice in whatever language you use to speak it, and is not automatically translated. Any steps you take to disguise your voice are just as effective for messages delivered via this spell as they are for your normal speech. Mage's decree isn't a language-dependent spell; all targeted creatures receive the message, but might not understand it if they don't understand the language in which you spoke the message.|CASTERLEVEL|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Alternatively, you can simply obscure all identifiers, making it more difficult to determine who cast the spell. In either case, if the object is the subject of a greater detect magic spell, any Spellcraft check made to identify the unique spellcasting identifiers of the aura automatically produce the result you chose unless the observer disbelieves the spell with a successful Will save (as with magic aura, however, detect spells don't grant a save to disbelieve). If cast on a creature, you can make that creature register to detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were the subject of any number of spells that you specify, when the spell is cast. Alternatively, you can make the creature register as nonmagical, hiding all spell effects that he is currently affected by from such scrutiny. If you choose to make the creature register as being the subject of one or more spells, you can also alter the unique spellcasting identifiers of those spell auras, in the same fashion as described for objects. If the target is a creature, you can also alter how the creature registers to arcane sight, making the creature appear to have or not have spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether those abilities are arcane, divine, or psychic in nature, and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability they currently have available for use. Similarly, you can alter the way the target appears when viewed with greater detect magic, causing the last spell that he cast to seem to be any spell of your choice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The spell can indicate an identical match, a categorical match, or no match. For instance, blood samples are identical if they are from the same creature. They are categorical if they are from the same species. There is no match if they are from different species, or if one sample is merely stage blood. Alternatively, you can compare dissimilar items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you can compare a creature's tooth against a bite mark and know if that creature could have caused the bite mark. This spell is not infallible—an identical match can result from comparing items or creatures that are duplicates of one another. For instance, a knife might have an identical match with a stab wound if an identical knife was used to inflict the wound, and twins might have identical blood or tissues.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Anyone who then tries to draw the weapon must spend a standard action and succeed at a Strength check to do so, provoking attacks of opportunity whether the attempt succeeds or fails. The DC for Strength checks required by this spell is equal to the spell's save DC. If a target weapon is not currently sheathed or slung as the spell is cast, the weapon immediately attempts to sheathe itself, and its wielder must succeed at a Strength check to prevent it from doing so. Once sheathed or slung in this way, the weapon is difficult to draw, as previously noted above. Unattended weapons that are not currently sheathed or slung are anchored in place by the spell, and require a successful Strength check to pick up; each attempt requires a standard action. If the wielder doesn't have a sheath or sling available for the weapon, failure on the Strength check causes the weapon to fall to the ground, at which point it requires a Strength check to pick up, as with unattended weapons.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The target can attempt a Will save to recognize the affliction as unreal. If that save fails, the creature suffers an imaginary affliction of your choice. Curse: The target believes she has been cursed. She takes a permanent –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for %1 hours. After her save to disbelieve, the target attempts a second Will save to negate this effect. Poison: The target believes she has been poisoned. Choose a physical ability score. Each round for %2 rounds the target takes 1d3 points of damage to the chosen ability score. Each turn, the creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the damage and end the ongoing damage. Wasting: The target believes she has contracted a wasting disease. Each day, the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued. A successful Fortitude save prevents this damage. Two consecutive successful saves end the effect. Since the affliction exists entirely in the creature's mind, phantasmal affliction is not affected by normal cures like neutralize poison or remove disease, or other effects like delay poison or the Heal skill. Ordinary immunities do not apply in this case (though a creature immune to the affliction receives a +4 bonus on the Will save to disbelieve the illusion). Constitution damage from the affliction can't kill the target. Instead, it causes the target to fall unconscious like other forms of ability damage.

Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round's damage and end the affliction. If you don't trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and leaves the target unharmed.

If the target fails the initial save to negate the curse, every day that it spends in a settlement, it must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it accidentally says or does something that makes others assume the rumor you specified is true in some way that is unflattering or incriminating. If the creature is not aware of the nature of the rumors, it takes a –4 penalty on these secondary saves. After the first failed save, the attitude each resident in the settlement has regarding the target is worsened by one step. For each additional failure, the target becomes the victim of focused harassment. A group of residents taunts or attacks the creature, potentially sending the authorities to investigate if the rumor indicates criminal guilt. The spell can be cast at any distance. The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection you have to that creature. The target gains the same bonuses and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties that apply to the scrying spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another plane), except that you can't cast pox of rumors without at least a possession or garment to use as the material component, and the target takes no penalty when you use a possession or garment and only a –5 penalty when you use a piece of the target's body.

The killer's right hand becomes stained indelibly red, and this stain can't be removed (although it can be hidden by magical or mundane means, such as disguise self or by wearing gloves). If the killer is not humanoid, or doesn't have a right hand for some other reason, the spell instead causes a red stain in the shape of a hand to appear elsewhere on the creature's body (typically on the chest). This spell affects only the creature that directly killed the targeted corpse. Other individuals that contributed to the target's death are unaffected, and if the victim did not die from violence or died indirectly (for instance, if the creature died from suffocating after someone trapped it in a room filling with water), then the spell has no effect. The killer can attempt a Will save to resist the spell's effects. Distance is not a factor, but the killer must be on the same plane as you at the time you cast the spell, or the spell fails. Once a corpse has acted as the focus for red hand of the killer, it can never act as the focus for another casting of red hand of the killer.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reincarnate Spy				CLASSES:Druid,Shaman=6|Witch=7																	SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Healing											TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,M,DF	CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Touch							TARGETAREA:Dead creature touched																DURATION:Instantaneous													SAVEINFO:None; see text											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.223		DESC:This spell functions as reincarnate except that you can cause the new body to resemble a particular creature, matching its age category and sex and rerolling any race result that would be the wrong size category. The subject further gains a +5 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the chosen creature due to similar features, although it might take a penalty for being the wrong race. The spell automatically leaves you with a small piece of the creature's new body, typically a lock of hair (useful for scrying and other such spells).

Resplendent Mansion			CLASSES:Psychic,Sorcerer,Wizard=9																	SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Creation										TYPE:Arcane.Psychic			COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 minute								RANGE:Long							TARGETAREA:Opulent mansion, up to 300 feet on a side and (CASTERLEVEL/4) stories tall							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days [D]											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.224		DESC:This spell creates a towering mansion. While casting the spell, you hold an image of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and is decorated to match your image. You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally. A resplendent mansion contains the same types of foodstuffs and servants as a mage's magnificent mansion. Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each alarm has a different sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used. The mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting all structural requirements for being built on, for example, a mountainside. The mansion adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there's a 10%% chance each day that the mansion begins to sink or collapse. The mansion doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and can't be created among a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the mansion when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete mansion. Focus; a miniature cornerstone carved from precious gemstones worth 500 gp|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rumormonger					CLASSES:Medium=2|Bard,Inquisitor,Mesmerist=2|Psychic=3													SCHOOL:Divination																TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long							TARGETAREA:One rumor																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days [D]											SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text									SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.224		DESC:You utter a brief anecdote or bit of news as the verbal component of this spell and track its progress through a social gathering or other crowd. When someone who heard the rumor directly from you and repeated the rumor is within your range, they glow silver to your sight, though this glow doesn't occur if the creature is in disguise (unless it was in the same disguise at the time of casting). You can choose to follow the rumor by selecting any such creature in range, at which point the creatures who heard the rumor from you no longer glow silver, and now the creatures who heard the rumor from your chosen creature glow silver instead. You can follow the rumor's path until you reach a creature that heard the rumor but didn't repeat it (or repeated it incorrectly). The glow identifies only creatures who heard the same information you conveyed. Minor cosmetic changes in the rumor don't interrupt the chain, but when the rumor no longer resembles the information you imparted, the trail stops and the spell ends. You can instead use this spell to trace a rumor back to its source once you hear it. In this case, you repeat the rumor as you heard it for the spell's verbal component. The person who told you the rumor can attempt a Will save to end the effect. Failure indicates the silver glow leads to the individual that told her. This process continues each time you locate the next individual spreading the same information. Each individual attempts the save until one of them succeeds (in which case the spell ends and you can't attempt to trace this particular rumor again) or you trace the rumor to its original source. As with the other application of the spell, tracing a rumor back fails to cause a creature to glow if it is in disguise, unless it was in the same disguise at the time of speaking the rumor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Instead of being triggered whenever a creature of Tiny size or larger enters the warded area, you can set whatever triggering conditions you wish, as long as they are based on observable phenomenon. For example, you could cause the selective alarm to trigger when creatures of a certain race (such as orcs, bugbears, or kobolds) enter the area, or whenever a group of four or more creatures enters the area together, or when a metal object is brought into the area. You can't choose triggering conditions that rely on unobservable information, such as having it triggered when creatures of a certain alignment enter the area, nor could you have the alarm be triggered by “something worth more than 5,000 gp” entering the area, or even “a weapon” entering the area, because an item's value and classification as a weapon is subjective, and might vary from one person to the next.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shamefully Overdressed			CLASSES:Bard,Inquisitor,Mesmerist=2|Psychic=3															SCHOOL:Enchantment		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic		COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close							TARGETAREA:Creature touched																	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]											SAVEINFO:Will negates											SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.225		DESC:The target sees its own attire as hopelessly out of fashion, ostentatious, and embarrassing, and is filled with a compulsion to strip off all clothing. Each round, the target must spend a move action to remove a worn item that can be removed with a move action, dropping the item once it is removed. The target doesn't distinguish between magical and nonmagical items when removing them. Each round it removes an item as determined randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly, don't include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don't include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can't have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn't fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM's discretion. The target regards the discarded items with revulsion, and if forced to touch such an item (such as with a melee or ranged touch attack using the item as an improvised weapon), the target becomes sickened for 1d3 rounds. Other than the move action to remove items, the character can take whatever actions it chooses.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

As long as you concentrate, you can cause the sound's apparent location to change as you see fit within range from your current location. Once you cease concentrating, the sound moves so that it remains the same relative distance and direction from the target. This spell can fool any sound-based blindsense or blindsight (including echolocation), but it can't fool other forms of detection such as other forms of blindsense or blindsight, lifesense, normal vision, and tremorsense. The target receives a saving throw against the effect if it doesn't wish for you to shift its sound, and any creature that interacts with the illusion receives a Will save to disbelieve the glamer.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Swallow Poison				CLASSES:Alchemist,Druid,Shaman,Witch=5																SCHOOL:Transmutation															TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal						TARGETAREA:You																			DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged																											SOURCEPAGE:p.226		DESC:A special gland grows on the inside of your throat, which absorbs any poisons that you ingest, and can be used to expel them in a toxic spray. Any time you consume ingested poison during the spell's duration, you can roll a caster level check against the poison's save DC in order to harmlessly absorb the poison, ignoring its effects. The spell can absorb up to %1 doses of poison, after which the gland is unable to process any more poison, and any further doses of ingested poison affect you normally. You store each dose of absorbed poison within the gland, and you can end the spell to spray one dose of absorbed poison out of your mouth as a standard action. This sprays the poison in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save (at swallow poison's DC) or be exposed to the sprayed poison, which is treated as though it were a contact poison for this purpose. Everything about the poison other than its type, including its frequency, effect, and saving throw DC, are unaffected by this spell. Any other doses of poison you had absorbed instantly become inert when you end the spell. If the spell's duration ends without you spraying a poison, all poisons you had absorbed become inert.|CASTERLEVEL/3|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

If she is in the midst of another situation as vital as protecting her darkest secret, such as combat, this doesn't cause her to cease participating, but otherwise, she becomes compelled to use her abilities and skills to determine exactly how much the other individual knows. Even if she isn't around other creatures or otherwise avoids confronting her paranoia for a time, the nagging fear causes the target to become shaken for the duration of the spell (though this doesn't stack with other fear effects to make the target frightened or panicked). The subject's paranoia increases over time, forcing her to take additional steps to protect herself from the other creature. Depending on her personality (or subject to the GM's discretion), she might confess, publicly demand to know what the other creature knows, attack the other creature to silence it, or offer the other creature a bribe. The spell fails if the target truly feels she has nothing to hide.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

TARGETAREA:40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.226		DESC:You immediately become aware of any teleportation effects that begin or end within the spell's area. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the exact origin point of any teleportation effect that originates within the spell's area, and the exact end point of any teleportation effect that terminates within the spell's area. Further, you can detect the lingering traces of any teleportation effect that occurred up to 1 hour previously, in the same fashion. You intuitively know, to the nearest minute, when the teleportation effect occurred. Whenever you detect the origin point or termination point of any teleportation effect with this spell, you can study that origin point or termination point for 1 round. If you do, you can attempt a caster level check (DC = 11 + the teleportation effect's caster level), taking a –5 penalty if the effect occurred more than 1 minute ago. If you succeed, you gain a glimpse of the teleportation effect's termination point (if you detected an origin point) or origin point (if you detected a termination point). This glimpse lasts long enough for you to get a brief look at the area, but not long enough to scrutinize it in detail. It doesn't come with any geographic knowledge of the location, so it is not sufficient for teleport or similar magic. You can't retry the caster level check, even if you cast trace teleport again.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You must overcome the target's spell resistance to plant the triggered hallucination, but the target doesn't attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with audiovisual hallucination). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech. You set the triggering condition (such as hearing a certain word or seeing a type of creature) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger can't be based on any quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. Triggered hallucination uses the target's senses to notice triggers.

Spells like detect magic can't locate any magic aura from either the target trap or from undetectable trap. Furthermore, a character under the effect of the find traps spell doesn't receive an automatic chance to locate the target trap when she comes within 10 feet of it, and the bonus on Perception checks from find traps doesn't apply to attempts to notice the target trap. Add +%1 to the DC for any creature without the trapfinding class ability to notice the target trap with Perception checks. A ranger with the ranger traps class feature can cast this spell on a ranger trap he creates as part of the same action he uses to prepare a ranger trap. This doesn't reduce the spell's casting time if such a ranger casts this spell on an ordinary trap, even one that he created himself using Craft (traps).

This trail can't be more than 24 hours old. You can follow the trail at any speed, provided you have line of sight to the trail. You can distinguish the trail of the particular creature followed even if it joins and splits with other trails. Once you have selected a trail to follow using this spell, it can't be changed. The spell is unable to follow teleportation or interplanar travel for any distance. The trail appears to end where the creature teleported (though a successful Spellcraft check allows you to determine the method of teleportation, if a spell was used). Unerring tracker can't track creatures under the effect of a pass without trace spell, as those creatures leave no trail at all, but can track creatures using nondetection (though not mind blank). This spell can be used to track flying creatures, but the trail must at least begin on a solid surface. This spell doesn't reveal the creature's current position or any shorter path than the one it followed (for instance, it will not reveal that the creature doubled back upon the trail until you reach the point where the creature turned around.)

During the spell's duration, you can move through one of the two portals. When you do, you teleport to the other portal, emerging in either direction. Both portals must be open and unobstructed when you cast the spell and enter the first portal, and they both must be large enough for you to fit through, otherwise the spell ends and the teleportation fails. You can bring along objects as long as their combined weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.

The target gains the ability to speak, understand, read, and write that language. When you cast this spell, you can attempt a DC 15 Linguistics check. If you succeed, choose an additional language, plus one more language for every 10 by which your check result exceeded the DC. Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. As with comprehend languages, this spell doesn't impart insight into material the target read, just the literal meaning, and it doesn't allow the target to read magical writing or decipher codes. If the target lacks the mental capacity to grasp a language, it still gains enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell endows the target merely with a temporarily enhanced vocabulary, the person offering instructions to nonsentient creatures must take care to avoid metaphors or any other ambiguity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

This spell allows children of creatures that are Medium or smaller when fully grown to grow one size category to the normal, adult size of that type of creature, but otherwise the selected age increase doesn't alter the creature's size. A change in size doesn't alter the target's ability scores.
