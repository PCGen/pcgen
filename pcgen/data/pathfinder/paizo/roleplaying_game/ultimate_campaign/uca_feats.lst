# Ability Name					Benefits
CATEGORY=FEAT|Accursed.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level, as the curse interferes with all magic. Unlike most spell resistance, it can't voluntarily be lowered, though your own spells and magic items still automatically affect you. Goal:Your curse is lifted or you are able to purge the corruption of your fiendish blood (the circumstances of either vary widely based on the nature of the curse, and are up to the GM). Completion Benefit:You lose the spell resistance described above. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your character level, but only against harmful enchantment, necromancy, and transmutation spells and spell-like abilities-your aura resists further attempts to curse you. Harmless spells automatically bypass this spell resistance whether you desire it or not. This spell resistance can be voluntarily lowered.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Arisen.MOD			BENEFIT:You don't die until your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than 4 + your Constitution score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining 1 temporary hit point per hit die. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes. Normal:You die when your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than your Constitution score. Goal:You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity's chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon-a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM's choice. Completion Benefit:You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Battlefield Healer.MOD	BENEFIT:When attempting a concentration check caused by receiving damage (including ongoing damage), you reduce the damage taken by 50%% for the purposes of determining the concentration check DC. Goal:Over time, provoke at least 20 attacks of opportunity for casting conjuration (healing) spells on allies. These spells don't have to succeed to count. Completion Benef it:You automatically succeed at concentration checks for conjuration (healing) spells caused by taking damage.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Champion.MOD			BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can declare a single combat challenge to one foe within 50 feet and in line of sight. Upon doing so, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against that foe as long as no one else threatens that opponent or until the single combat challenge ends. If another combatant attacks you or your foe, the challenge ends and you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC for 1 round. Though you can declare a single combat challenge at will, once you declare it on a foe you can't declare it on the same foe for another 24 hours. Goal:Defeat an appropriate number of challenging foes in single combat. These combats must not be interrupted by other creatures, and the foes must not have already been substantially injured or impaired prior to combat with you. Completion Benefit:Your bonuses for single combat increase to +2. In addition, any confirmed critical hits you make against such a foe deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Damned.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based checks involving evil-aligned outsiders and +1 bonus to the DC of spells and spell-like abilities you use against such creatures. You take a -2 penalty on Charisma-based checks involving good-aligned outsiders. Goal:Successfully trade your soul to an evil outsider. Completion Benefit:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to an ability score of your choice. This enhancement bonus can't be dispelled or removed save by the direct intervention of a deity, and counts as a supernatural ability. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks (including dispel checks and checks to bypass spell resistance) against goodaligned outsiders. If you die while under the effects of this agreement, you can't be brought back from the dead unless the evil outsider permits it. You lose your completion benefits immediately and permanently if you renege on the arrangement by which you traded your soul, though you keep the feat's basic benefits.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Deny the Reaper.MOD		BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Heal, this bonus increases to +4. You can apply first aid as a move action and don't take a penalty when treating deadly wounds without a healing kit. Goal:Bring an ally back from the dead, including by using breath of life or reincarnate. Completion Benef it:You and each ally within 10 feet of you gain a +2 bonus on saves against death effects. In addition, once per day you can spontaneously convert any 5th-level or higher conjuration (healing) spell into breath of life.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Eldritch Researcher.MOD	BENEFIT:When casting a spell you've created, add 1 to your caster level. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Spellcraft, this bonus increases to +4. Goal:Create a new spell of at least 6th level. Completion Benefit:The save DCs for any spells you create increase by 1 when you cast them. In addition, when applying metamagic feats to self-created spells, reduce the total level adjustment by 1. You can't reduce metamagic costs to lower than the spell's original level in this manner. Special:For a self-created spell to benef it from this feat, it must be a truly novel spell. Spells slightly altered from the original (for example, delayed blast fireball as compared to fireball) gain no benef it. Alchemists can benef it from this feat as though their formulae and extracts were spells.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Fearless Zeal.MOD		BENEFIT:Once per day, you can add a +2 bonus on any single attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check. You must choose to add this bonus after the die has been rolled and success or failure determined, but before the DC of spells and spell-like abilities you use against such creatures. You take a -2 penalty on Charisma-based checks involving good-aligned outsiders. Goal:Successfully trade your soul to an evil outsider. Completion Benefit:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to an ability score of your choice. This enhancement bonus can't be dispelled or removed save by the direct intervention of a deity, and counts as a supernatural ability. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks (including dispel checks and checks to bypass spell resistance) against goodaligned outsiders. If you die while under the effects of this agreement, you can't be brought back from the dead unless the evil outsider permits it. You lose your completion benefits immediately and permanently if you renege on the arrangement by which you traded your soul, though you keep the feat's basic benefits.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Feral Heart.MOD			BENEFIT:Whenever you receive a morale bonus on Strength or attack rolls (such as from heroism or the barbarian rage class feature), you receive a +2 bonus on Dexterity- and Strength-based ability and skill checks and a +1 bonus on Ref lex saves until the morale bonus effect ends. Goal:Woo and then marry or otherwise enter into a committed relationship with a person from a civilized culture. This relationship must be forged in love, not bought or coerced. Completion Benefit:Delay the penalties for the exhausted, fatigued, shaken, and sickened conditions for 1 round after first receiving them. If you already have the condition in question and it is applied again, this feat provides no benefit. Despite ignoring the penalties you do still have the condition. For example, if you become shaken again while benefiting from this feat, you become frightened as normal.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Foeslayer.MOD			BENEFIT:The save DCs for your spells or abilities increase by 1 when you use them against the chosen group, and you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against their attacks. Goal:Slay an appropriate number of challenging foes. Completion Benef it:You gain the benef its of the Improved Critical feat on attacks made against members of your chosen race. Your dodge bonus to AC against such foes increases to +2.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Forgotten Past.MOD		BENEFIT:The duration of mind-affecting spells (even beneficial ones) is halved for you, to a minimum of 1 round. Your inquisitive nature gives you a +2 bonus on Perception checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception, this bonus increases to +4. Goal:Regain a major portion of your lost memories. The exact means varies, possibly requiring a wish, assistance from a divine being, reliving a past life, or confronting the situation that led to your memory loss. This process must involve encountering a challenging foe, though possibly in ways other than direct confrontation. Completion Benefit:You roll twice whenever you attempt a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, keeping the better result. Special:Restoration of memories by means less significant than miracle or wish does not qualify for the prerequisite.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Glimpse Beyond.MOD		BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks to identify the vulnerabilities and powers of aberrations, Knowledge (planes) checks to identify the vulnerabilities and powers of evil outsiders, and Knowledge (religion) checks to identify the vulnerabilities and powers of undead, and you can make such checks untrained. If you have 10 or more ranks in any of these Knowledge skills, the bonus increases to +4 for the appropriate skill. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against fear effects. Goal:Be killed or driven insane (as determined by the GM) by an aberration, evil outsider, or undead. This leaves your mind permanently marked. Completion Benefit:Any sane creature that attempts to read your thoughts takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modified negates). In addition, the effect of any ability damage, ability drain, or penalty to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is halved (minimum 1). You take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. Whenever you roll a save against a mind-affecting effect, roll twice and keep the better result.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Innocent Blood.MOD		BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. Each time you slay an intelligent creature, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and caster level checks for 1 minute (this bonus does not stack with itself ). Goal:Slay at least 200 more intelligent noncombatants, then slay a challenging foe that seeks to either bring you to justice for your crimes or usurp your position. Completion Benefit:Any shaken creature takes double the normal penalties when attacking you, making saves against your abilities, or resolving skill checks with you as a target.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Liberator.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and skill checks when your actions would directly lead to freeing prisoners or slaves. Goal:Free at least 200 slaves through perilous rescues (not merely buying them at market). Completion Benefit:You gain the ability to inspire others through your dedication to your cause. Allies within 20 feet receive your Liberator feat bonuses when working with you to free prisoners or slaves. In addition, as a standard action you can inspire slaves and former slaves within 120 feet, giving them temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your character level and a +1 bonus on saving throws. These benefits last for 1 hour, and a given creature can receive this benefit only once per day. These are mind-affecting effects, and the inspiring bonus is language-dependent.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Lost Legacy.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma-based ability checks and skill checks. Goal:Regain your family's lost claim, either for yourself or another in your family. In the process of completing this claim, you must decisively defeat a challenging foe that seeks to deny your birthright. Completion Benefit:You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom ability checks, Wisdom-based skill checks, and Will saving throws. Special:If you manage to regain your position without defeating a challenging foe, you may still complete this story feat at a later date if a suitable challenging foe attempts to steal your birthright again.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Magnum Opus.MOD			BENEFIT:Choose a single Craft or Perform skill. Whenever you take 10 with this skill, treat your die result as a 15 instead. Goal:Either sell a single self-created work of art for at least 25,000 gp, perform at least 10 performances for audiences of 100 or more while achieving an extraordinary result or better, or win the artistic Completion Benefit:You gain the ability to reroll a failed saving throw once per day. You must keep the result of the second roll, even if it is lower.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Shamed.MOD			BENEFIT:Being observed drives you to excel. When you're in a conf lict that is being observed by others not involved in the conf lict, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and skill checks. Goal:You can complete this goal in one of two fashions. First, thwart a chosen foe in a fashion that clearly establishes your superiority to the general public. Second, prove your worth another way, like gaining a title or becoming the chosen hero of a region. Completion Benefit:Your newfound confidence gives you temporary hit points equal to your character level. These temporary hit points last until lost and refresh any time you rest long enough for natural healing to occur (Core Rulebook 191), whether or not any healing actually occurs.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Stronghold.MOD			BENEFIT:You can spend a move action to give battle orders to your troops, granting creatures under your command within 60 feet your choice of a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, or a +1 bonus on a single type of saving throw. All creatures must receive the same benefit. You can't use this benefit on allies not under your command. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect. Goal:Build or capture a stronghold capable of housing a force of at least 200 troops, and staff it with at least 100 combat-capable soldiers (or the equivalent) under your command. You must also provide food and water sufficient to survive at least a 6-month siege and a gold reserve sufficient for at least 6 months of wages if your troops require pay. Completion Benefit:Your battle order bonuses improve to +2, and the range of your orders increases to 120 feet. In addition, you can give two different orders to your troops. For example, you could grant your archers +2 on attack rolls while your front line gains a +2 bonus to AC. Completion Benefit:You gain the ability to reroll a failed saving throw once per day. You must keep the result of the second roll, even if it is lower.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Thief of Legend.MOD		BENEFIT:Once per day when you attempt a Disable Device check to open a lock or Sleight of Hand check to pick a pocket, you can roll twice and take the better result. Goal:Steal a famous and well-guarded treasure worth at least 50,000 gp while leaving no evidence of your involvement behind. The treasure must be protected by a mix of at least 8 traps or challenging foes. Any guardians need not be defeated, merely bypassed. You don't need to keep the treasure, and you can boast of the theft afterward. Completion Benefit:You gain the ability to reactively disarm a trap. When you trigger a trap, you can attempt a Disable Device check with a -5 penalty to interrupt the trap's function, leaving it still armed but effectively preventing it from activating. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. Since the trap is still armed, it might activate again if you don't immediately back away or otherwise avoid repeating the act that set it off the first time.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Town Tamer.MOD			BENEFIT:Choose a particular settlement. When you're in your chosen settlement, the DC of Intimidate checks made against you increases by 10. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against undesirable elements like criminals or ruffians in your chosen settlement. This bonus increases to +2 for combat maneuver checks. Goal:Defeat 10 more troublemakers in your chosen settlement with a CR equal to your character level or higher, and in the process eliminate a serious criminal threat or otherwise clean up the streets. Completion Benefit:You gain the ability to designate a new chosen settlement as often as you wish. You must first live in a settlement for 1 week to make it your chosen settlement. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on saving throws when in your chosen settlement.
CATEGORY=FEAT|True Love.MOD			BENEFIT:You add 1 to the save DC and caster level of your spells and spell-like abilities with the emotion descriptor. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Sense Motive, this bonus increases to +4. Goal:Find a way to be with your true love (even if you can't formally wed). Completion Benefit:The inspiration of knowing your love waits for your return gives you a +2 bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks whenever you are below a quarter of your total hit points (not counting any temporary hit points). You lose this completion benefit if your relationship with your true love comes to an end for any reason, including death. Special:At the GM's discretion, you can find true love with a person other than the one you designated when you chose this feat. In this case, the love you initially chose was wrong for you, but this became obvious only when you found the one truly meant for you.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Unforgotten.MOD			BENEFIT:Your dogged determination reduces any nonlethal damage you take by 1 point, to a minimum of 1 point of nonlethal damage. You also gain a +1 bonus on Will saves. Goal:Find your lost loved one alive, and in the process, decisively defeat a challenging foe who kept you apart. Completion Benefit:You gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws, replacing the +1 bonus on Will saves. If you find your loved one dead, you lose all benefits from this feat until you put the body and possibly soul to proper rest. Putting the body to rest restores the completion benefit, but you don't regain the ability to reduce nonlethal damage.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Vengeance.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls against your chosen foe and known minions of that foe. Goal:Thwart your chosen foe. Completion Benef it:You gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws. This bonus stacks with this feats's bonus against your foe and its minions, should they survive.
