Boundless Reach		KEY:Apostate Devil ~ Boundless Reach	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																																	DESC:A deimavigga's claws slice through reality, allowing it to make melee attacks against any creature it is aware of-typically meaning creatures within 100 feet. The devil still only threatens the 10-foot area around it and it cannot make attacks of opportunity against creatures farther away. This ability can span vast distances, allowing a deimavigga making use of divination magic to detect distant creatures and attack foes separated by miles or even planes. Spells like forbiddance, which prevent planar travel, also protect against a deimavigga's claws. The spell dimensional anchor also prevents a deimavigga from using this ability for the duration of that spell. An attacked creature can retaliate that round, striking at the devil's claws with weapons or spells as if its entire body were present, but cannot grapple or otherwise prevent the claws from vanishing out of reach at the end of the round.

Every round a deimavigga speaks (a free action), all non-devils with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 30 feet must make a DC %1 Will save or become vulnerable to its blasphemous discourse. The DC of this Will save increases by +1 for each consecutive round a creature has listened to the same deimavigga speak. Creatures must be listening to a deimavigga to be affected by its oration. Deafened creatures and those in combat-either with the deimavigga or other creatures-are not considered to be listening. Victims cannot simply declare they are not listening without taking steps to impede their hearing. Upon failing this save, a victim can be affected by the heretical power of a deimavigga's words. The devil may use its speech to affect a listener in ways that mimic any of the following spells: calm emotions (DC %2), charm monster (DC %3), command (DC %4), confusion (DC %5), crushing despair (DC %6), deep slumber (DC %7), enthrall (DC %8), modify memory (DC %9), rage (DC %10), or suggestion (DC %11). Victims still receive saving throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. A creature that makes its save against this ability is immune to that particular devil's evangelization for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is Charisma-based.|Evangelization_DC|DC_Calm_Emotions|DC_charm_monster|DC_command|DC_confusion|DC_crushing_despair|DC_deep_slumber|DC_enthrall|DC_modify_memory|DC_rage|DC_suggestion	ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Evangelization	BONUS:VAR|DC_calm_emotions|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+2	BONUS:VAR|DC_charm_monster|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+4	BONUS:VAR|DC_command|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+1	BONUS:VAR|DC_confusion|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+4	BONUS:VAR|DC_crushing_despair|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+4	BONUS:VAR|DC_deep_slumber|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+3	BONUS:VAR|DC_enthrall|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+2	BONUS:VAR|DC_modify_memory|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+4	BONUS:VAR|DC_rage|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+3	BONUS:VAR|DC_suggestion|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE+3	BONUS:VAR|DC_CHA_SPELLBASE|10+CHA	BONUS:VAR|Evangelization_DC|DC_CHA_SA	BONUS:VAR|DC_CHA_SA|10+(TL/2)+CHA	BONUS:VAR|Evangelization_DC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Evangelization)	SOURCEPAGE:p.54
Indomitable Oration	KEY:Apostate Devil ~ Indomitable Oration	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																	DESC:A deimavigga's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or warped. In areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, even in areas of magical silence, these devil's voices can still be heard normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly spoke in all tongues at once.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.54
Malleable Form		KEY:Apostate Devil ~ Malleable Form		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																	DESC:A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own form as a free action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.54
Ohrwurm			KEY:Apostate Devil ~ Ohrwurm			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DEFINE:Ohrwurm_DC|0																																																																																																													DESC:As a standard action, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 28 Will save or have the devil's words take root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals have a +2 bonus on their saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimavigga's words seem to have no effect. Anytime the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an additional DC %1 Will save or be affected as per the spell nightmare (even if the victim doesn't technically sleep). After a night of suffering vivid dreams and wrestling with the devil's words, the victim must make yet another DC 28 Will save or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free of this effect, requiring a spell such as miracle, modify memory, or wish.|Ohrwurm_DC																																																																																																																																					ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Ohrwurm		BONUS:VAR|Ohrwurm_DC|DC_CHA_SA	BONUS:VAR|Ohrwurm_DC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Ohrwurm)																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.54

SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Wisdom Drain		KEY:Apostate Devil ~ Wisdom Drain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																																	DESC:A deimavigga drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its claw attack.

Those struck by this bile find themselves drenched in liquid corruption so profound it impedes the power of non-evil divine magic for 10 minutes. Any non-evil divine spellcaster who casts a spell targeting a creature soaked in an ayngavhaul's bile must make a DC 23 caster level check or have the spell fail. A creature affected by this bile may wash off the sludge by spending a round and using at least a gallon of fluid to cleanse itself. The save DC is Constitution-based.																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Devil Summoner		KEY:Heresy Devil ~ Devil Summoner			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																											DESC:Ayngavhauls know the secrets of all breeds of devils, utilizing such leverage in the summoning of their kind. Any devil within 30 feet of an ayngavhaul has half again the normal chance of having a fiend respond to its summon devil ability. For example, an osyluth's usual 35%% chance to summon another bone devil increases to 52%% when within 30 feet of an ayngavhaul. Summoning bonuses provided by multiple ayngavahuls do not stack. Ayngavahuls are immune to this ability, from both themselves and others of their kind.																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Searing Word		KEY:Heresy Devil ~ Searing Word			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																											DESC:An ayngavhaul can speak words of torment, giving them shape and sending them streaking toward their enemies in the form of diabolical sigils. Any good-aligned creature struck by one of these infernal words takes 3d6 points of hellfire damage (half fire, half evil energy); nongood creatures take half damage. These words cannot affect creatures affected by protection from evil or within an area of magical silence.

SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Throne of Skulls		KEY:Heresy Devil ~ Throne of Skulls			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																											DESC:All ayngavhauls hover upon fearsome infernal thrones. These thrones grant the devils their fly speed and a +4 armor bonus. Should an ayngavhaul be grappled or knocked down, it is unseated from its throne and loses these benefits. An ayngavhaul has telepathic command over its throne and may call its conveyance back and reseat itself as a full-round action.

Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Once a gaav uses its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later.|NoxiousBreathDC																													ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Noxious Breath																																																																							BONUS:VAR|NoxiousBreathDC|10+CON+(HD/2)	BONUS:VAR|NoxiousBreathDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Noxious Breath)	SOURCEPAGE:p.58
Shared Senses		KEY:Lesser Host Devil ~ Shared Senses		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																											DESC:All gaavs and magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one gaav or magaav to the next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an entire massive swarm instantly. It is still possible for a gaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other gaavs nearby are not.																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.58

Infernal Wound		KEY:Greater Host Devil ~ Infernal Wound		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																																																																																											DESC:The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 1 additional hit point each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 Heal check or any spell that cures hit point damage; casting a curative spell on the injured creature requires a successful DC 15 caster level check, otherwise the spell has no effect. The check DC is Constitution-based.

Master Grappler		KEY:Greater Host Devil ~ Master Grappler		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																											DESC:A magaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks.

It is still possible for a magaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other gaavs or magaavs nearby are not. All magaavs may telepathically communicate with all other gaavs and magaavs within 100 feet at once, allowing the greater host devils to command entire swarms. Although magaavs rarely contradict one another, if faced with competing orders, gaavs follow the commands of the closest magaav.																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.59
Summon Devil		KEY:Greater Host Devil ~ Summon Devil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																											DESC:Once per day a magaav can attempt to summon 1d2 gaavs with a 60%% chance of success.

It can also cross areas covered with deadly impediments (such as caltrops or thorns) without being damaged or hindered. In addition to being entirely immune to fire, the creature's legs are immune to acid and cold, allowing it to cross even rivers of acid or lava without being damaged or hindered as long as the material is less than 4 feet deep. This ability does not protect a levaloch against magical hindrances like black tentacles, web, or similar spells.
