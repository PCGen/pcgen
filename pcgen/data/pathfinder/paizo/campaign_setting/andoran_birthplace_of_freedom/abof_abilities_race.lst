Swarmlike						KEY:Bee-Man ~ Swarmlike				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The Bee-Man exists as a hive mind controlling a body of swarming bees. He is immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells). This immunity doesn't apply to spells and effects generated by the Bee-Man himself, nor to mind-affecting effects that target single creatures. The Bee-Man takes half again as much damage (+50%%) from damaging area effects. He is also susceptible to high winds and is treated as a Diminutive creature for the purposes of determining wind effects.

Fey Bargain						KEY:Candlestone Courtier ~ Fey Bargain	CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:Once per week, a Candlestone courtier can grant a limited wish or a permanent +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. In exchange, the bargainer is cursed to be carried off in its dreams each night by the courtier to a never-ending fey ball that, while pleasant as often as not, affects the dreamer as nightmare, requiring a saving throw each night (Will DC 21 negates). The DC to remove this curse is reduced by 4 if the courtier is killed, and a successful coup de grace on the courtier with a cold iron weapon automatically ends the curse. Ending the curse also ends any noninstantaneous effects of the bargain. A creature can have only one fey bargain at a time.
Spellthrust						KEY:Candlestone Courtier ~ Spellthrust	CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESC:When a courtier threatens a critical hit, it can trigger a spell-like ability with a range of touch against the target.

Discordant Aura					KEY:Erinat ~ Discordant Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Aura	DESC:An erinat radiates an aura that imparts both gullibility and susceptibility to mental influence. Creatures within a 20-foot radius take a â€“2 penalty on saves against compulsion effects, and Bluff checks attempted against such creatures gain a +5 bonus.

Malicious Mischief				KEY:Erinat ~ Malicious Mischief		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESC:A pair of erinats working together for 1 round can present an item and compel a creature to take it. This functions as beguiling gift (DC 13), but rather than using the item in the appropriate fashion, the recipient is compelled to use the item to attack a random non-gremlin creature within 30 feet, even if the recipient must use the item as an improvised weapon. Additionally, a group of six erinats working together over the course of 1 hour can create an effect identical to malicious spite (DC 16) on any living creature. This effect functions at CL 6th, and the target creature must be either willing or helpless.

#Ragewight
Race Traits ~ Ragewight				CATEGORY:Internal			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Ragewight ~ Create Spawn|Ragewight ~ Savage Fury|Energy Drain

Create Spawn					KEY:Ragewight ~ Create Spawn			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESC:Most humanoids slain by a ragewight rise as cairn wights (though with chaotic evil alignments) in 1d4 rounds. However, humanoids with 6 or more Hit Dice and the rage class feature instead become ragewights, retaining the rage powers they had in life. Such spawn are under the command of their creator until its death, at which point they become free-willed undead.
Savage Fury						KEY:Ragewight ~ Savage Fury			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:A ragewight can trigger a savage fury as a free action. It can use this fury for 24 rounds each day. These rounds don't need to be consecutive. The ragewight gains a +6 profane bonus to its Strength and Charisma and a +3 profane bonus on Will saves when using this fury. When a ragewight ends its fury, it is staggered for 1d4 rounds and can't resume its fury during this time. This ability otherwise functions as the greater rage barbarian class feature, treating the ragewight's racial Hit Dice as its barbarian level for the purposes of rage and any rage powers. NOTE: Stats given are for during a savage fury. Typical rage powers are animal fury, intimidating glare, knockback, superstition (+4 morale bonus vs. spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities), unexpected strike

#Sawdust Slough

Choking Chaff					KEY:Sawdust Slough ~ Choking Chaff		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Aura	DESC:A sawdust slough constantly releases particles of plant matter that form a cloud of choking dust around it. Creatures beginning their turns adjacent to a sawdust slough are coated with this dust, revealing invisible creatures (as glitterdust, though without any of that spell's other effects) and dazzling creatures as long as they remain adjacent to it and for 1d3 rounds thereafter. In addition, creatures that breathe that begin their turns adjacent to the sawdust slough are sickened for the same duration (Fortitude DC %1 negates). Creatures that hold their breath before being exposed to the choking chaff aura are immune to the sickening effect for as long as they hold their breath. A sawdust slough's choking chaff aura is burned off when it takes fire damage, and does not become active again until the end of the sawdust slough's next turn.|CON+13	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(5 ft., DC %1)|CON+13
Flammable						KEY:Sawdust Slough ~ Flammable		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:Sawdust sloughs and the particulate cloud surrounding them are highly flammable, causing any damaging flame around them to flare up in gouts of fire.

Lunar Sympathy					KEY:Silverblooded Lycanthrope ~ Lunar Sympathy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A silverblood lycanthrope is filled with enthusiastic vigor when the light of the moon is strongest. When the moon is at least half full, a silverblood lycanthrope gains the benefit of bless whenever it is outdoors at night. On nights of the full moon, a silverblood lycanthrope gains the effect of heroism rather than bless, and retains the benefit indoors. When the moon is less than half full, a silverblood lycanthrope becomes fatigued during the night. On nights of the new moon, a silverblood lycanthrope becomes fatigued during the day and each night becomes exhausted and takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (and a caster level of 20th). The defensive benefits from the magic circle are not included in the statistics above.		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(30 ft., DC 30, 10 rounds)
