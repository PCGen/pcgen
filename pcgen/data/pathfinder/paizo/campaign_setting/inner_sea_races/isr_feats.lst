For each other ally within 30 feet who does so, you reduce the cost of the spontaneous metamagic feat by 1 level (to a minimum of 0, and you must have at least one ally assist you, even if the metamagic feat is normally a +0 adjustment). The allies don’t need to have the metamagic feat you choose to apply, and the effective level of the spell (after applying the metamagic feat) can’t be higher than the highest level of spells you can cast. Lastly, when you use this ability, the spell each ally readies is lost, as if they had cast that spell.

DESC:You’re so loyal to your family or friends that you’re willing to suffer for them.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.207		BENEFIT:Whenever an opponent makes a melee or ranged attack against one of your allies who is adjacent to you and who also has this feat, you can spend an immediate action to shield the ally with your own body. You become the target of the attack, and the opponent gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll. For the purpose of determining distance, cover and concealment, you count as being in your ally’s square when the attack is resolved. If the attack misses you due to concealment, blink, or a similar effect, it instead targets your ally as if you had not used this feat’s ability.
Mirror Kin					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Teamwork			PRERACE:1,Gnome%										PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Gnome ~ Gnome Magic			PRESKILL:1,Bluff=8																				PRETEXT:Bluff 8 ranks, gnome, gnome magic racial trait.								DESC:Combining your cunning with illusion magic makes you and your allies nearly indistinguishable.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.207		BENEFIT:Whenever you’re adjacent to any gnome allies who also have this feat, your appearance and mannerisms change into an amalgam of the features of you and your allies, making you and your allies look exactly alike. Your shapes occasionally appear to blend into each other, making it impossible to distinguish you and granting you and any affected allies a 20%% miss chance due to concealment. This is an illusion (figment) effect. Spells and effects that don’t require an attack roll, such as area spells, affect you normally. An attacker must be able to see and reach both you and your ally to be fooled. If you’re invisible or the attacker is blind, the feat has no effect. Because this feat relies on the fact that both you and your ally are blending together to create the visual illusion, it doesn’t function with effects like the inquisitor’s solo tactics class feature; both you and the ally must possess the feat. If you have more than one adjacent ally with this feat, this feat applies to all allies who qualify.
One Mind					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Teamwork			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Alertness						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Background,Vudrani						PRESKILL:1,Sense Motive=3																			PRETEXT:Alertness, Sense Motive 3 ranks, human (Vudrani).

SOURCEPAGE:p.207		BENEFIT:Whenever you’re adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, if your ally is not flat-footed, you’re also not considered flat-footed before you act in combat (you might become flat-footed in other ways, however). Additionally, if your ally can see a creature that you can’t see, that creature doesn’t gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against you from being invisible, nor do you take a –2 penalty to AC for being blinded if your ally can see.
Pack Intimidation				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork		PRERACE:1,Half-Orc%									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Half-Orc ~ Intimidating																									PRETEXT:Half-orc, intimidating racial trait.

DESC:You have turned your deadly childhood games into a tactical advantage.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.208		BENEFIT:Whenever an ally who also has this feat makes an attack with a thrown weapon and misses the target by 4 or less, you can catch the weapon as an immediate action. Both you and your ally must be within 30 feet of the target, and you must be able to trace a line from any part of your space to any part of your ally’s space so that the line passes through the target’s space. As part of the action to catch the weapon, you can throw it at the target of the original attack.

SOURCEPAGE:p.208		BENEFIT:While you’re adjacent to an ethnically Chelish or Taldan ally who also has this feat, you gain a +2 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check as an immediate action.

SOURCEPAGE:p.209		BENEFIT:Whenever you’re within 30 feet of a halfling ally who also has this feat, as a move action you can draw an item in that ally’s possession as if it were on your person. This is not a magical effect—you just conveniently happen to remember that you had borrowed that item earlier. The item must be something that easily fits in a pocket or sleeve, such as a dagger, potion, wand, or scroll. When you or an ally draw an item (whether or not you do so using Shared Ownership) or otherwise definitively establish who is holding the item, you can’t use Shared Ownership to draw the item in this manner until you have had at least 1 hour to mingle with your companions.
