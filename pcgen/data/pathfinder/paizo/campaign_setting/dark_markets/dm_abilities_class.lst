Alternately, you can create two Bags of Holding (Type II), though their extradimensional spaces are not linked in any way.|BalancedScaleBottomlessBagDuration|PREVARGTEQ:BalancedScaleBottomlessBagLVL,6							BONUS:VAR|BalancedScaleBottomlessBagDuration|BalancedScaleBottomlessBagLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.54
Access the Vault		KEY:Balanced Scale ~ Access the Vault	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:BalancedScaleAccessTheVaultLVL|0									DESC:You gain the power to access the First Vault, Abadar's planar repository for perfect versions of every item ever made. Once per week ypu can summon a copy of any one nonmagical item (normal or masterwork) as long as its market price is equal to or less than 500 gp per divine caster level and its volume is less than 1 cubic foot per caster level. The item remains with the balanced scale for 1 minute per class level, after which it returns automatically to the First Vault. Consumable items vanish once used but function for their normal duration or 1 minute per class level, whichever is less.	DESC:You can also use this ability to summon a magic item from the First Vault. Items with charges always arrive fully charged, and the price limit applies to this fully charged version.|PREVARGTEQ:BalancedScaleAccessTheVaultLVL,5																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Eloquent Bargainer	KEY:Balanced Scale ~ Eloquent Bargainer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:Getting permission to enter treasure-laden ruins sometimes requires talking to the right people and handing around a few coins for bribes, "finder's fees," and so on. You know which palms to grease and what promises to make, gaining a +2 bonus to Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when you offer an appropriate bribe  (minimum 10 gp x the level of the recipient) during the interaction. In addition, you receive a +2 sacred bonus on Charisma checks made to compel a bound creature to perform a service when using the Lesser Planar Binding and Greater Planar Binding spells.

Vault Jump			KEY:Balanced Scale ~ Vault Jump		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike																	DESC:Once per day, you can create a one-way portal through the First Vault, which has one of two effects. First, you may use the portal as if it were a Dimension Door, but can only travel to areas within range and to which you have been. Second, you may use the portal as if you were casting Word of Recall, but instead of returning to your sanctuary you always returns to the closest active temple of Abadar. Your caster level for this ability is equal to your divine caster level, and you can bring others with her as def inedin the spell descriptions. Travel through the First Vault is uncomfortable and disorienting, possibly because the Vault rejects imperfect mortal flesh in an attempt to protect itself, or because the aura of so much perfection is overwhelming to mortal senses. Regardless of the distance traveled, you (and anyone traveling with her) arrive 1d4+1 rounds later and are nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds after arriving (Fortitude DC 15 negates).
