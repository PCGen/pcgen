This functions as the familiar option of the wizard's arcane bond class feature, with the tinkerer's effective wizard level equal to her alchemist level. If a tinkerer would gain a familiar through another class, those levels stack for purposes of determining the familiar's abilities. A tinkerer's familiar can take any shape the tinkerer wishes, but its statistics and abilities are identical to a clockwork spy (Bestiary 3 58) with the normal adjustments and abilities for a familiar applied, and it is a construct with the clockwork subtype.

Additionally, a tinkerer can remove a spent item and install a new one as a move action.
Clockwork Mimicries					KEY:Tinkerer ~ Clockwork Mimicries				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alchemist Class Features.TinkererClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary												SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:A tinkerer can use her mechanical mastery to create clockwork mimicries of powerful magic items. Doing so takes 1 hour of uninterrupted work, and allows the tinkerer to create a wondrous item that functions for %1 hours per day. When creating such a clockwork item, the tinkerer must use materials worth an amount equal to the wondrous item's construction cost. She need not meet any of the item's other creation requirements. A tinkerer cannot create a mimicry of a consumable wondrous item or a wondrous item with finite charges, and she can have only one mimicry at a time. The clockwork item never functions as a wondrous item for any other creature. The tinkerer can spend 1 hour disassembling a clockwork mimicry and reassembling it into a mimicry of a different wondrous item. When she disassembles a clockwork mimicry, she can salvage parts worth half of the mimicry's creation cost. She still must pay the full creation cost for the new mimicry. This resets the duration the mimicry functions per day.|AlchemistLVL

The Nexian spellspy receives the spell's results as normal. This ability does not allow her to see through her familiar's eyes; for example, the Nexian spellspy would know about a powerful magic item detected through her familiar, but she would not know its exact location or exactly what the item looked like.

The rival spellcaster receives a Will saving throw (DC %1) to recognize that the results are falsified. Depending on the spell, the stored results from the familiar might make this falsification obvious (and thus no Will saving throw is necessary to determine the falsification).|10+WitchLVL/2+INT
