Arcane Reinforcement			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3					SCHOOL:Transmutation														TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:Concentration [up to 8 hours]															SOURCEPAGE:p.60		DESC:You cast this spell as you begin crafting an item using a Craft skill, and add your Spellcraft ranks to Craft checks made to create that item. As part of concentrating on the spell, you must continue chanting the verbal components, pausing at most for a few seconds at a time to speak, chew, and so on. If the crafting takes more than 1 day to complete, you must cast the spell each day to gain its benefit.
Canopic Conversion			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=9				SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Evil|Death				TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S,F,M	CASTTIME:1 round				RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living humanoid												DURATION:Instantaneous and see text			SAVEINFO:Fortitude half					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.60		DESC:This spell eviscerates the target, drawing forth its life essence as well as its internal organs. The target takes %1d6 hit points of damage. If this damage kills the target, the spell pulls the creature's organs into a set of 4 canopic jars and seals them; 1d4 rounds later, the corpse revives as a mummy (if 8 HD or fewer) or an advanced mummy (if 9 HD or more). The mummy is not under your control, but the canopic jars give the bearer certain powers over it. Anyone holding one of the jars can communicate with the mummy as if the two shared a common language. The bearer gains the benefits of protection from evil and sanctuary, but only against that mummy. Unsealing or breaking a jar is a standard action, which dissipates its power (and protection) but lets the bearer issue a short command to the mummy, similar to a suggestion spell (Will DC 23 negates). You (and only you) may unseal all 4 jars in a 10-minute ritual to control the mummy with an effect similar to geas (Will DC 23 negates); most casters typically include a restriction that the mummy will not harm them, as unsealing the jars leaves them vulnerable. Focus: four alabaster canopic jars worth 100 gp each; Material: black onyx worth 100 gp per hit die of the target|MIN(20,CASTERLEVEL)
Chastise					CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Transmutation														TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes																SOURCEPAGE:p.61		DESC:You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks to convince a listener that they will get in trouble with their superiors or with the law if they don't do what you ask.
Hibernate					CLASSES:Druid=1							SCHOOL:Necromancy															TYPE:Divine					COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]			SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.61		DESC:You place a willing subject into a cataleptic state. It remains aware of its surroundings but is paralyzed, appearing dead unless observers make a DC 20 Heal check. Hibernate delays the effects of poison, disease, and bleed effects for the spell's duration, and half of any hit point damage suffered by the subject is converted to nonlethal damage.
Mark of Blood				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Necromancy															TYPE:Arcane					COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One weapon and one living creature (see text)								DURATION:1 minute and permanent; see text		SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.61		DESC:You place a drop of your blood on a weapon and charge it with magic so that you transfer a small amount of your life essence to the next creature you strike with the weapon. Thereafter, you may spend a move action to know the direction and general distance of that creature. You must strike a creature within 1 minute of casting this spell or the magic is wasted.
Sotto Voce					CLASSES:Bard=1|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=0			SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Fear|Mind-Affecting|Sonic	TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One humanoid creature of 4 HD or less									DURATION:1 round						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.61		DESC:Your dry, rasping whisper fills a living creature of 4 or fewer Hit Dice with unnatural dread. The affected creature must make a Will save or be shaken for 1 round.
Summon Elemental Steed			CLASSES:Druid=9							SCHOOL:Conjuration		SUBSCHOOL:Summoning		VARIANTS:Air|Earth|Fire|Water			TYPE:Divine					COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:10 minutes			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One chariot														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]		SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.61		DESC:You summon a greater elemental bound in the form of a mighty chariot that moves at your command and can carry up to nine Medium creatures. Passengers inside are not harmed by the elemental, and can see, breathe, and act normally, suffering no environmental damage even when the elemental chariot is flying, underwater, burrowing, or using earth glide. Passengers are not otherwise protected, though the elemental chariot does provide cover like a normal chariot. The elemental keeps all of its statistics and abilities, except it loses its slam attacks and gains a trample attack. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Tomb Legion					CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=8				SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Evil					TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Three or more advanced mummies, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; see text	DURATION:7 days or 7 months [D]; see text		SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.61		DESC:The spell creates 1d4+2 mummies with the advanced template. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for 7 days unless you dismiss them. If the mummies are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the mummies can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Mummies summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. You can only have one tomb legion spell in effect at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.
Tripvine					CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=1			SCHOOL:Transmutation														TYPE:Arcane.Divine			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:10-foot-long rope or vine											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes			SAVEINFO:Reflex negates					SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.62		DESC:You animate a rope, vine, or similar object so that it attempts to trip any creature that comes near. The rope attacks anything in a 10-foot-square area you designate. The rope does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB is %1. A tripped target that was running, jumping, or charging takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Creatures aware of the tripvine gain a +4 bonus to their CMD against it.|CASTERLEVEL+2
