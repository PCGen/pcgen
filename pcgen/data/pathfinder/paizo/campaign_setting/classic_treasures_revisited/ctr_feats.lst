Companion Figurine				CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:General								PRESKILL:1,Handle Animal=1																																	PRETEXT:Animal Handling 1 rank, own a figurine of wondrous power.						DESC:Youâ€™ve developed an especially close bond with the creature summoned by your figurine of wondrous power.												SOURCEPAGE:p.25			BENEFIT:You may select the creature summoned by your figurine of wondrous power as an animal companion or familiar, or as appropriate. The figurine has the standard abilities of a familiar or animal companion of its type, plus additional abilities related to its figurine type (see full text). The main advantage of this is that if your familiar or companion is killed in creature form, it merely reverts to statue form and can be used again later. The standard figurines available as animal companions or familiars are detailed in the main text body.

DESC:You can deliver a breathtaking bardic performance while activating the powers of a magical instrument, or utilize your bardic prowess to enhance the instrument's power.		SOURCEPAGE:p.38			BENEFIT:When activating a magical instrument as a full-round or standard action, you may begin a bardic performance as a free action. Your performance must use a Perform skill appropriate to the instrument. Alternatively, you may expand 2 rounds of bardic performance to add +2 to any save DCs associated with the use of the instrument's powers. If your instrument summons allies, such as pipes of the sewers or the horn of Valhalla, your bardic performances with that instrument affect those allies even if they normally would not.
