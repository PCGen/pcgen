Deific Obedience		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												PREDEITY:1,Y																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=3									PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks, must worship a deity.																													DESC:Your reverence for a deity is so great that daily prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons.						SOURCEPAGE:p.210	BENEFIT:Each deity requires a different daily obedience, but all obediences take no more than 1 hour per day to perform. Once you've performed the obedience, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the "Obedience" entry for the god to whom you performed the obedience. If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your deity upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the deity's second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the deity's third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon's effects are constant. Certain prestige classes (see page i98) gain access to these boons at lower levels as a benefit of their prestige class. If you have no levels in one of these prestige classes, you gain the boons marked as exalted boons. If you later take levels in sentinel or evangelist, you lose access to the exalted boons and gain access to the new boons appropriate to your class. If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience.
