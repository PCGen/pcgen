DESC:Not every adventure awaits within a sealed tomb or mad wizard’s tower. In seemingly civilized cities, dangers lurk down every twisting alley, and backroom deals might spell the end for nosy investigators. Pathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of the Streets provides the resources to take your Pathfinder RPG character from a dungeon-delver to a witty and backstabbing urbanite.
