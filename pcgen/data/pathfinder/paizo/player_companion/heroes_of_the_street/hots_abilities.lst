# Domain Powers
# ==============================

Athletic Exploit				KEY:Domain Power ~ Athletic Exploit		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:As a swift action, you gain the ability to overcome physical obstacles with ease. Until the beginning of your next turn, you halve your armor check penalty when attempting Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, and Swim skill checks (reduce penalty by %1), and you gain a %2 bonus on such skill checks. You can use this ability %3 times per day.|ACCHECK/2|max(1,DomainLVL/2)|3+WIS
Aura of Efficiency			KEY:Domain Power ~ Aura of Efficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:You can emit a 30-foot-radius aura that grants your allies a +4 bonus on all saving throws against effects that inflict the fatigued or exhausted condition.

You can use this aura for %2 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.|DomainLVL/2|DomainLVL
Deep Cover					KEY:Domain Power ~ Deep Cover			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:When you prepare your spells, you can also choose one cover identity—whether that of a real person or a fictitious one. You can assume the disguise of your cover identity in half the normal amount of time. When targeted by a spell or effect that would compromise your chosen disguise (such as detect evil, detect thoughts, or zone of truth), as an immediate action you can force the creature using the ability to attempt a Will save (DC %1). If the creature fails, it gains false information in keeping with your cover identity. You can use this false information ability %2 times per day.|10+DomainLVL/2+WIS|3+WIS
Divine Challenge				KEY:Domain Power ~ Divine Challenge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:As a swift action, you can challenge a visible foe within 30 feet, gaining a +1 sacred bonus to your AC against that creature's attacks and a +%1 bonus on Bluff skill checks to feint against it.

Prohibition					KEY:Domain Power ~ Prohibition		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:As a standard action, you can command a creature within 30 feet to refrain from committing a particular action (including any referenced in the spell forbid action). If the creature performs the named action before the beginning of your next turn, it takes 1d6+%1 points of damage and the effect ends. This is a language-dependent effect. You can use this ability %2 times per day.|DomainLVL/2|3+WIS	DESC: You can attach a spell effect to the prohibition as if it were the spell rune domain ability; the spell takes effect if the creature performs the named action. This spell must be of at least 1 level lower than the highest-level cleric spell you can cast, and it must target one or more creatures. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it affects only the creature that triggers the rune. Attaching a spell in this way extends the duration of the prohibition by a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, or until it is discharged.|PREVARGTEQ:DomainLVL,8|PREDOMAIN:1,Legislation Subdomain (Rune)
Sheltering Walls				KEY:Domain Power ~ Sheltering Walls		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike.DomainPower		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	DESC:As a standard action, you can touch an ally to summon a floating blockade of stone, granting the ally the benefits of partial cover for %1 rounds.

Touch of Virulence			KEY:Domain Power ~ Touch of Virulence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:As a standard action, you can touch a diseased creature and exacerbate its condition. If it fails a Fortitude save (DC %1), the creature takes damage as though it had failed its Fortitude save against the disease and any remaining onset time for the disease ends. You can use this ability %2 times per day.|10+DomainLVL/2+WIS|1+(DomainLVL>=14)+(DomainLVL>=20)
Aura of Bedlam				KEY:Domain Power ~ Aura of Bedlam		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:You can emit a 30-foot-radius aura of chaos and strife for %1 rounds. Enemies in the aura take a –%2 penalty on concentration checks and are treated as experiencing vigorous motion (concentration DC = 10 + spell level) when attempting to cast spells.
