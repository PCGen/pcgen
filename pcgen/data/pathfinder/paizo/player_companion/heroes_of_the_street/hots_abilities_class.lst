Busker					KEY:Bard Archetype ~ Busker					CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.BardArchetype																				SOURCEPAGE:p.26		DESC:A busker uses his dazzling physical stunts to get by on his own in the city streets. Buskers commonly use their skills to entertain for a few coins, but also pick pockets, hide in plain sight as statues, and manipulate the desperate in medicine shows. Many buskers are also jugglers (Pathfinder Player Companion: Ranged Tactics Toolbox).

He can use this ability for %1 rounds per day. Maintaining a stunt is a free action, but it ends immediately if the busker is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. This ability is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, and other effects that affect bardic performance. Like a bardic performance, a busker stunt cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities.|BardicPerformanceDuration	DEFINE:BardicPerformanceDuration|0	DEFINE:BardicPerformanceLVL|0		BONUS:VAR|BardicPerformanceDuration|4+CHA	BONUS:VAR|BardicPerformanceLVL|BardLVL		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Quick Hands|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Patter|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Living Statue|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,3	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Fascinate|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,6	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Suggestion|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,8	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Inventive Juggler|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,9	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Busker Stunt ~ Impossible Sleight of Hand|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,15		ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|BardicPerformanceDuration	ASPECT:CheckType|Rounds per day	ASPECT:MasterAbility|Busker Stunts
Flexible Performer			KEY:Busker ~ Flexible Performer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.BuskerClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary													SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:A busker can attempt Acrobatics, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks to earn money instead of Perform checks. He can use his Bluff modifier in place of his Diplomacy modifier on Diplomacy checks.

Quick Hands					KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Quick Hands				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance										SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:As a swift action, a busker can call on his stunts to gain a +%1 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks, a +%1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and a +%1 bonus on attack rolls as if from haste.|1+((BardLVL+1)/6)	DESC: While maintaining this stunt the busker also gains an extra attack at his highest base attack bonus as if from haste.|PREVARGTEQ:BardicPerformanceLVL,5																																																																																																																																																																ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Patter					KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Patter					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance										SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:A busker can engage in brisk conversation that seems innocuous, but actually encourages creatures to reveal secrets to the busker. Each round while maintaining this stunt, the busker can force one creature within 30 feet that is able to see and hear the busker and has an attitude of indifferent or better towards him to attempt a Will save (DC %1). On a failed save, the target must answer one yes/no question the busker asks to the best of its ability. Anyone observing this (including the creature asked, even if it succeeds at its save) must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the busker's Bluff check) to realize the question was asked or answered. A target that feels threatened or is in combat is immune to this ability. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting enchantment effect.|10+(BardicPerformanceLVL/2)+CHA																																																																																				ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Living Statue				KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Living Statue				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance										SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:A busker can use this stunt to hold perfectly still. While maintaining this stunt the busker can attempt a Bluff check (opposed by all observers' Sense Motive checks) to appear paralyzed, dead, or as a statue (this requires that the busker be disguised to look as though he were made of stone or metal, which is aided with a statue disguise kit). Even magical means of determining the true nature of the busker do not function for an observer that fails this check. If the busker takes any physical actions, this stunt ends.

Fascinate					KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Fascinate					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance	DEFINE:FascinateCreatures|0	DEFINE:FascinateDC|0	SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:A busker can use this stunt to cause up to %1 creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the busker, and capable of paying attention to him. The busker must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents this ability from working. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC %2) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the busker cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the busker's performance for as long as he continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.|FascinateCreatures|FascinateDC	BONUS:VAR|FascinateCreatures|(BardicPerformanceLVL+2)/3	BONUS:VAR|FascinateDC|10+(BardicPerformanceLVL/2)+CHA			ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Suggestion					KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Suggestion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.SpellLike.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance		DEFINE:SuggestionDC|0						SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:A busker can use this stunt to make a Suggestion (as per the spell) to a creature he has already fascinated. Using this ability does not disrupt the Fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the Fascinate effect). The busker can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Making a Suggestion does not count against the daily use of Busker Stunts. A Will saving throw (DC %1) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.|SuggestionDC																																																																																																BONUS:VAR|SuggestionDC|10+(BardicPerformanceLVL/2)+CHA		ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts

While maintaining this stunt, the busker can use a thrown weapon (even an improvised one) to threaten spaces as though he were using a reach weapon. The busker treatens squares up to %1 feet away from him with thrown weapons|((BardicPerformanceLVL-6)/3)*10																																																																																																																																																																									ASPECT:ChildAbility|Busker Stunts
Impossible Sleight of Hand		KEY:Busker Stunt ~ Impossible Sleight of Hand		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.BardicPerformance.Bardic Performance										SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:A busker can store items in or retrieve them from a personal extradimensional space with a maximum capacity of 8,000 cubic feet and 8,000 pounds as a busker stunt. The item may be sent from or called to his hand or any place it fits on his person. He can access the extradimensional space only to store or retrieve a single object at a time; to retrieve or store an object larger than Fine size, the busker must expend 1 additional round of busker stunts for each size category larger than Fine. This stunt is instantaneous and must be activated again each time the busker wishes to use it. The extradimensional space empties its contents within the busker's space if he dies.

Instead, she can apply a +4 morale bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater bloodrage and to +8 when she gains mighty bloodrage. She can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. When using a controlled bloodrage, an urban bloodrager gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Charisma-, Dexterity-, and Intelligence-based skills. A controlled bloodrage still counts as a bloodrage for the purposes of any spells, feats, and other effects. This ability alters bloodrage.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Controlled Bloodrage

When the bloodrager casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the spell's area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn't been targeted or wasn't in the area.

She can select from the bard or magus spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another.

In urban settings, an urban hunter's animal companion seems domesticated and likely harmless to anyone who has not seen it in combat (potentially reducing the DC of Diplomacy checks to convince anyone to allow it into secure areas). It draws no more attention than a friendly dog, loyal horse, or similar tame animal. Creatures who have never seen the animal companion make an attack must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the animal companion's Stealth check) to realize the animal companion is a potential threat.
