###Block: Lion Blade Class Features
# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type										Description																																																																																																																		Source Page
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Lion Blade ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Lion Blades gain no additional proficiency in weapons or armor.																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Master of Disguise		KEY:Lion Blade ~ Master of Disguise			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The first skill a Lion Blade learns is to perfectly alter her appearance in order to blend in to any crowd and any environment. A Lion Blade no longer suffers penalties to Disguise checks made to change her gender, race, or age.																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Move with Crowd			KEY:Lion Blade ~ Move with Crowd			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Lion Blades are masters of moving in crowds. When moving through groups of humanoids that would normally count as rough terrain, the Lion Blade instead moves normally.																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Inspire Self			KEY:Lion Blade ~ Inspire Self				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A Lion Blade learns a quiet, throaty chanting that puts her in a light trance, increasing her focus on the task at hand. The Lion Blade gains a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she is able to continue her chant. The bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and +6 at 9th level. The GM may rule that certain uses of this ability are infeasible- chanting to make the Lion Blade move more quietly, for example, is self-defeating. The effect lasts as long as the Lion Blade concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. Inspire self is a mind-affecting ability.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Slowing Strike			KEY:Lion Blade ~ Slowing Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per round on a successful sneak attack, a Lion Blade may choose to deal 1 less die of sneak attack damage and instead reduce the target's ground speed by 5 feet. Once an opponent's speed has been reduced to 0 feet, he is immobilized (but not helpless). If the target uses wings to fly, the Lion Blade can choose to reduce the creature's flying speed instead of its ground speed. The movement penalties imposed by slow strike are removed once the creature fully heals or it receives a lesser restoration spell.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Sneak Attack			KEY:Lion Blade ~ Sneak Attack				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. Sneak attack bonuses from other classes stack.																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Unexpected Suggestion		KEY:Lion Blade ~ Unexpected Suggestion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, once per day a Lion Blade can use suggestion on a target she catches flatfooted. Her caster level is equal to her class level.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Hide in Plain Sight		KEY:Lion Blade ~ Hide in Plain Sight		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, a Lion Blade can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a Lion Blade can hide herself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Expeditious Advance		KEY:Lion Blade ~ Expeditious Advance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a Lion Blade's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor or light armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the Lion Blade's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Glean Information			KEY:Lion Blade ~ Glean Information			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, a Lion Blade's study of body language gives her an advantage when observing or manipulating others. A Lion Blade gains a +2 bonus to Bluff, Intimidate, Gather Information, and Sense Motive checks. Once per day per character level, a Lion Blade can add a +2 circumstance bonus to any Knowledge skill check (including bardic knowledge) relating to humanoids in her presence.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Secret Step				KEY:Lion Blade ~ Secret Step				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A Lion Blade can slip through crowds with supernatural ease. Once per day per two class levels, a Lion Blade can take a move action to move up to double her speed through a crowd without provoking attacks of opportunity for this movement. For example, if a Lion Blade has a movement speed of 40, she can use secret step to move 80 feet as a move action. She can only use this ability to move through humanoid crowds that would otherwise count as difficult terrain. This is fast, agile movement, not teleportation, so she must physically traverse the intervening space (for example, she cannot use this ability to bypass a trapped floor or wall of fire, even if surrounded by crowds).

Cloud the Mind			KEY:Lion Blade ~ Cloud the Mind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, a Lion Blade becomes incredibly difficult to find. Whenever a Lion Blade is using Hide or Move Silently, observers suffer a -5 on their Listen or Spot checks. The Lion Blade gains SR equal to 10 + her class level against divination spells.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Narrow Miss				KEY:Lion Blade ~ Narrow Miss				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level, a Lion Blade can dodge swiftly and erratically as a swift action, gaining 20%% concealment until her next turn. She may use this ability once per day per two class levels.																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Grandmaster of Disguise		KEY:Lion Blade ~ Grandmaster of Disguise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, a Lion Blade is able to improvise materials for a disguise that are as effective as an actual disguise kit. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus to disguise checks (this overlaps with the bonus from an actual disguise kit). Once per day per class level she can make a Disguise check at a -20 penalty to create a disguise as a full-round action.																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Silent Soul				KEY:Lion Blade ~ Silent Soul				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Lion Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, a Lion Blade has mastered the ability to still her thoughts, her movement, and her sounds to such a point that she becomes harder to dominate, harder to see, and harder to hear. All Hide or Move Silently checks made by the Lion Blade gain a +10 circumstance bonus (this is in addition to the -5 penalty imposed by cloud the mind) and the Lion Blade gains SR 20 against mind-affecting effects.
