# Spell Name				Description
Ceremony.MOD				DESC:You harness divine power to create one of four different ceremonies-a funeral, holiday fete, marriage, or naming-and can also create two domain-based ceremonies. Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell. If you are using the downtime system from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god. Unless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature's highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so.
Detect Relations.MOD			DESC:You can determine whether or not two or more creatures are  related by blood. The amount of information gleaned depends  on how long you study a particular area or set of subjects.  1st round: Whether or not the subjects are related by blood.  2nd round: Number of related subjects and their general  relation to one another (for example, this would reveal that one  subject is a descendant of the other, but it would not specify  "mother" or "grandmother").  3rd round: Precise relationship between subjects in the  area. A target's Will save prevents you from determining its  exact relationship with another creature, and only one subject  needs to succeed at this save to prevent you from determining  its relationship with another creature. (So, for instance, if two  brothers are in the area and one succeeds at his Will save,  you could tell that they are siblings, but could not distinguish  whether they are full- or half-siblings.)  Each round, you can turn to detect relations in a new area. The  spell can penetrate barriers, but 6 inches of stone, 1 inch of common  metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 1 foot of wood or dirt will block it.  This spell functions by analyzing the blood and minds of  creatures in the area, collectively examining these traits and  comparing them to those of others in the area while looking for  patterns. Thus, adoptive siblings and parents cannot be detected  with this spell, since they share no blood.
Business Booms.MOD			DESC:You may cast this spell immediately prior to spending 1 day  of downtime to promote a business (see page 85 of Ultimate  Campaign). The spell is cast on a building you wish to promote,  which is magically bestowed with magical decorations and  other improvements that make it generally more appealing,  and it is treated as seeing increased activity for the spell's  duration. If the spell is cast on a building that you do not  promote immediately thereafter, the spell is expended with  no effect.  After the initial day of downtime spent promoting your  building, the spell maintains the influx of activity for a number  of days equal to half your caster level (maximum 5 days). During  this time, you needn't spend additional downtime to promote  the building, but you must spend capital as normal to promote  the building. The capital the affected building generates for  you is unaffected by the spell. If you spend 1 day promoting a  different building than the target of this spell while this spell  remains active, the spell immediately ends.
Prosperous Room.MOD			DESC:The targeted room is enchanted to have magical appeal for  customers, an increase in the worktlow of its employees, or the  generation of additional materials to work with. While this spell  is in effect, the targeted room produces 1 more Goods, Labor,  Influence, or Magic than it already does. If the room produces  multiple types of capital, it produces an additional capital of  each type. If the room generates gp, it generates 250 more.  Only the capital that the room normally generates increasesï¿½ rooms that do not already generate Magic, for instance, do not  generate Magic because of this spell.  While this spell is in effect, neither you nor your allies can  further interact with the affected room or the spell's effects  immediately end. You cannot spend downtime actions to run  a business with a room that is affected by this spell, though  any employees or workers that operate within the room may  continue to do so normally.
Renovation.MOD				DESC:Upon casting this spell, you permanently rearrange and resize the  rooms in a building you constructed as a downtime activity (see  page 84 of Ultimate Campaign). You may reorganize and remap  the building however you please, as if each room had just been  constructed and is being positioned for the first time. You cannot  make any changes to a building that changes how much a room  would cost to create or that alters the benefits a room provides.  The structure also must remain in the same general position  within the district. If you don't wholly own the structure, all of  the structure's owners must consent to the changes being made  before the spell is cast; otherwise, it fails immediately.
Teleport Structure.MOD			DESC:You instantly teleport a building in a settlement you control to  another lot or series of lots in the same settlement district. The  building to be teleported must be unoccupied, and the area  to which you wish to move the building must be cleared and  unoccupied during the casting of this spell. A building cannot be  teleported to an area it would not normally be able to occupy,  such as an area adjacent to a prohibited building type. If you  don't wholly own the structure, all of the structure's owners  must consent to the structure's teleportation before the spell is  cast; otherwise, it tails immediately.  This spell only functions on buildings that occupy a number  of lots equal to one-fourth your caster level (so, for instance, a  16th-level caster could use this spell on a building that occupies  up to 4 lots).
Bless Army.MOD				DESC:Bless army fills an army with courage. The army gains a +1 bonus  on OM and Morale checks.
Imbue Army Special Ability.MOD	DESC:You imbue the target with an army special ability (see page 242  of Ultimate Campaign) possessed by the army's commander.  The army is treated as if it consists of units who all possess  the chosen special ability. This special ability is in addition to  any special abilities the army inherently possessed prior to the  casting of the spell.
Tactical Insight.MOD			DESC:Choose a single army tactic. You grant mastery of this tactic to the  target army for the spell's duration. This tactic may bring an army's  total known tactics to a number greater than normally allowed.
