###Block: Feat benefits
# Feat Name			Benefits
# Ability Name				Benefits
CATEGORY=FEAT|Firebrand.MOD		BENEFIT:You treat a torch as a light weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a light mace of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage, and you do not incur penalties as you would for using it as an improvised weapon.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Ordered Mind.MOD	BENEFIT:You are able to modify more of your spells to use as counterspells. The DC of the Spellcraft check you must succeed at to identify an opponent's spell is equal to 20 + the spell level of the opponent's spell (instead of 15 + the spell level), but you are able to cast as your counterspell any spell from the same school of the foe's spell (instead of the same spell). The level of the spell used to counterspell must be of a level equal to or higher than your foe's spell.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Destroy Identity.MOD	BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the target is so maimed that it takes 2 points of Charisma damage and becomes staggered for 1 round.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Fearsome Finish.MOD	BENEFIT:Upon reducing an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, for the remaining duration of the combat encounter, you gain a +4 bonus on any Intimidate checks made to demoralize opponents who can see both you and the opponent you reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. This bonus does not stack.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Reject Poison.MOD	BENEFIT:Whenever a creature attempts to poison you with a poison you have previously used or undergone the effects of, you have a 20%% chance of naturally rejecting the poison's effects on you, negating its effects and wasting its use.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Shadow Dodge.MOD	BENEFIT:You are able to use the light around you to move back and forth from shadow to light again, and your sudden shifting dazzles your enemies' eyes. By spending a number of feet (in 10-foot increments) when you use this feat to move from one square to another and back again, you gain a Dodge bonus to your AC. This bonus is equal to +1 for every 10 feet you spend moving like this. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity while using this ability. Enemies who do not use sight in order to pinpoint your location or who are otherwise able to locate you more precisely (such as creatures that possess blindsight, tremorsense, or true seeing) ignore this AC bonus. Likewise, this feat is ineffective in areas of darkness or bright light, where one cannot readily shift between light and shadow.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Merciless Rush.MOD	BENEFIT:When you bull rush a creature and your check exceeds the target's CMD by 5 or more, you can choose to move through that creature instead of pushing it back a number of feet, effectively trampling the creature and dealing it a number of points of damage equal to your Strength modifier.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Squash Flat.MOD		BENEFIT:Whenever you make a bull rush attack and your check exceeds the target's CMD by 5 or more, you can choose to expend one of the increments of 5 feet you would normally move the target back to instead attempt to trip the target as a part of your bull rush action. This does not  provoke an attack of opportunity.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Shatter Resolve.MOD	BENEFIT:When you damage a creature by channeling negative energy, you fill it with fear. A creature that is affected by your channel negative energy ability and fails its Will save to halve the damage also becomes shaken for a %1 rounds.|ClericChannelNegativeEnergyDice
CATEGORY=FEAT|Bloodletting.MOD	BENEFIT:Whenever you threaten a creature with a critical hit with a piercing or slashing weapon (regardless of whether you confirm the critical hit or not), you cause that creature to bleed, making it take 1 point of bleed damage at the beginning of each round thereafter.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Welcome Pain.MOD	BENEFIT:Whenever you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points because of an ongoing or repeating damage effect (such as bleed), you may make a last-ditch effort to shed the condition. If you succeed at a DC 25 Will save, you ignore the damage that would reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points that turn. The DC of each subsequent save made in this manner increases by 1. In addition, spells or abilities that have the pain descriptor deal only half damage to you (if any).
