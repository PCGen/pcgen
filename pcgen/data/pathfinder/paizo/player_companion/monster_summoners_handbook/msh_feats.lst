If the creature takes damage while you possess it, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC equal to the amount of damage taken) or be ejected from the creature immediately. If the creature takes enough damage to reduce it to 0 hit points or fewer, you are immediately ejected from the creature and take an amount of damage equal to double the level of the spell slot used to summon that creature.

Summon Guardian Spirit			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESPELL:1,Summon Monster III,Summon Nature's Ally III																							PRETEXT:Ability to cast summon monster III or summon nature's ally III.														DESC:A guardian spirit has selected you as its ward.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:Select one creature that qualifies to be an improved familiar, and apply the guardian spirit template (see page 26) to it. That creature is added to either your summon monster III or summon nature's ally III list as a summonable creature. When you summon your guardian spirit, the duration of the spell you use to summon it is 1 minute per level. A guardian spirit is always exactly the same creature, with memory of all the events that occurred while previously summoned; multiple versions of it can't be summoned. If it's killed while summoned, it cannot be summoned again for 24 hours. If you're capable of casting a higher-level summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, you can perform a ritual to attune the guardian spirit to a higher-level version of the spell. This also allows you to change any selections made regarding the abilities the creature gains based on the level of spell used to conjure it (see the table on page 27). This ritual takes 24 hours, and once complete it moves the guardian spirit to the higher-level list of creatures that can be summoned.
Tattoo Attunement				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=5			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Inscribe Magical Tattoo,Varisian Tattoo															PRETEXT:Inscribe Magical Tattoo or Varisian Tattoo; Spellcraft 5 ranks.														DESC:You've learned to absorb summoned creatures into temporary spell tattoos.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.14	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can touch a single creature that you've summoned, instantly transforming it into a magical tattoo on your body. This tattoo takes up one magic item slot if the summoned creature is Medium or smaller, and one additional adjacent slot for each size category larger than Medium (see page 16 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic for rules on magical tattoos). You can have only one such tattoo at a time. While in tattoo form, the summoned creature can't take actions and doesn't need to eat, sleep, or breathe; it retains the remaining duration of the summoning spell used to conjure it. The creature can stay in tattoo form for a number of hours equal to your caster level. If the creature is still in tattoo form at the end of that time, the tattoo disappears, the creature is sent back to the plane from which it was summoned, and the remaining duration of the summon is wasted. As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can cause the creature to change from a tattoo back into creature form, and appear in a square adjacent to you. The remaining duration of the spell is then expended as normal. The creature is staggered for 1 round after emerging from tattoo form. This is a supernatural ability.
Tattoo Conversion				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESPELL:1,Control Summoned Creature	PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=15		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Tattoo Attunement												PRETEXT:Inscribe Magical Tattoo or Varisian Tattoo; Tattoo Attunement; Spellcraft 15 ranks; ability to cast control summoned creature.

SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can make a melee touch attack against a summoned creature to transform it into a magical tattoo on your body as per Tattoo Attunement. When you later transform the creature from tattoo to creature form, you can attempt an opposed Spellcraft check against the creature's original summoner; if that summoner is unconscious or dead, you automatically succeed at the check. If you succeed, the creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + your caster level) or treat you as the caster of the spell that originally summoned it for the remaining duration of the spell. This is a supernatural ability.
Tattoo Transformation			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=9		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Tattoo Attunement																				PRETEXT:Inscribe Magical Tattoo or Varisian Tattoo; Tattoo Attunement; Spellcraft 9 ranks.										DESC:You've learned to take on some of the resistance of a summoned creature when you absorb it as a tattoo.														SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you use Tattoo Attunement on a creature you've summoned, you can gain that creature's elemental resistance as long as it is in tattoo form. If the creature has resistance to multiple elemental types, you gain only one of them. If the creature is immune to an elemental type, you gain resistance 20 to that type. For example, if the creature has resistance 10 to both fire and cold and immunity to electricity, you can gain resistance 10 to either fire or cold or resistance 20 to electricity as long as the creature is in tattoo form.

DESC:You've learned to summon a wider array of creatures.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.18	BENEFIT:When you summon one or more animals, humanoids, or vermin using a summon nature's ally spell (or an effect that mimics such a spell), instead of granting them the benefit from Augment Summoning, you can instead apply one of the following templates to them: aerial, aqueous, chthonic, fiery, or primordial. If you summon multiple creatures with one casting, they must all have the same template.
