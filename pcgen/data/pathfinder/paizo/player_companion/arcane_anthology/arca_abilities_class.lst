Her caster level for these spells is equal to her fighter level, and the bloodrager class spell list is considered to be her class spell list for the purposes of meeting prerequisites and using magic items.&nl; She uses the ranger's spells per day, but uses her Intelligence score to determine her bonus spells and spell saving throw DCs, just as a wizard does. She does not gain any other wizard abilities, such as an arcane bond or school. Each time she attains a new fighter level, she gains one bloodrager spell of her choice to add to her spellbook. The free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. She otherwise follows the rules for a wizard regarding her spellbook and learning or preparing spells

She must still add such spells to her spellbook to prepare them. If a spell appears on both the magus and sorcerer/wizard spell lists, the magus uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. A deep marshal cannot cast spells from the enchantment, illusion, or necromancy school and she cannot activate spellcompletion or spell-trigger magic items that use spells from those schools (without making a successful Use Magic Device check). This alters the magus's spellcasting.

# Enlightened Bloodrager
Enlightened Spellcasting	KEY:Enlightened Bloodrager ~ Enlightened Spellcasting						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Bloodrager Class Feature.SpecialQuality.BloodragerBloodlinePower1.BloodragerBloodlineSpells																																																																																																				DESC:An enlightened bloodrager's sophisticated outlook allows him to cast an expanded array of spells. Instead of his normal spells per day and spells known for his bloodrager level, an enlightened bloodrager uses the spells per day from the medium class (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 30). This grants him the ability to learn a number of 0-level spells, which are cast like any other spells, but don't consume spell slots and can be used again.&nl;The enlightened bloodrager adds all 0-level spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to his bloodrager spell list. He also adds all druid spells of 4th level and lower (including 0-level spells). If a spell appears on both the bloodrager spell list and the druid spell list, the enlightened bloodrager uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. The bloodrager treats any druid spells he takes with this ability as bloodrager spells for the purposes of other abilities (such as greater bloodrage).&nl;At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the enlightened bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, he loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the enlightened bloodrager can cast. The enlightened bloodrager can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.&nl;This ability alters spellcasting and replaces the bloodline power gained at 1st level and all bonus spells gained as part of a bloodline.
Enlightened Bloodrage		KEY:Enlightened Bloodrager ~ Enlightened Bloodrage						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Bloodrager Class Feature.SpecialQuality.BloodragerBloodlinePower4																																																																																																								DESC:At 4th level, while bloodraging an enlightened bloodrager takes no penalties to his AC, and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills. This ability alters bloodrage and replaces the bloodline power gained at 1st level. This replaces the bloodline power gained at 4th level.
Bloodline Feat			KEY:Enlightened Bloodrager ~ Bloodline Feat							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Bloodrager Class Feature.SpecialQuality.BloodragerDamageReduction																																																																																																								DESC:At 6th level, an enlightened bloodrager adds Expanded ArcanaAPG, Nameless One, and all feats that list Nameless One as a prerequisite to the list of feats he can select as a bloodline feat. This replaces the damage reduction the bloodrager gains at 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels.
Bloodline Powers			KEY:Enlightened Bloodrager ~ Bloodline Powers							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Bloodrager Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																																																																													DESC:At 8th level, an enlightened bloodrager gains the bloodline power normally granted at 1st level. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he gains the bloodline power normally granted 8 levels earlier, to a maximum of gaining at 20th level the bloodline power normally gained at 12th level.

At each class level, she chooses one spell from the druid spell list or one spell with the good descriptor from the cleric spell list. The spell must be of a spell level that she can cast. She cannot choose a spell with this ability that already appears on her arcanist spell list. At 1st level, a Magaambyan initiate can cast a spell that she has chosen with this ability by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to half the spell's level (minimum 1) to expend a spell slot of the spell's level to cast the spell as if it were on her spell list and prepared. Upon reaching 4th level and at every even-numbered arcanist level after that, a Magaambyan initiate can choose to lose a spell that she has chosen with this ability in exchange for a new spell that meets the same requirements of the same spell level. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 9th, and 17th levels.
Spell Mastery			KEY:Magaambyan Initiate ~ Spell Mastery								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.ArcanistExploitLvl5																																																																																																							DESCISPI:YES	DESC:At 5th level, a Magaambyan initiate gains Spell Mastery as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying Spell Mastery's prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy Spell Mastery's prerequisites, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Magaambyan initiate may also choose to select Spell Mastery as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.&nl;In addition, if the Magaambyan initiate gains levels in the Magaambyan arcanist prestige class (Paths of Prestige 34), her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels for the purpose of determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Magaambyan initiate who takes levels in Magaambyan arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with Spell Mastery, rather than spontaneous spell mastery's normal effect. She is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous spell mastery.&nl;This ability replaces the exploit gained at 5th level.

# Puppetmaster
Skills				KEY:Puppetmaster ~ Skills										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																																																																																														DESC:A puppetmaster gains 4 skill points per level. He adds Knowledge (history, local, religion) and all Perform skills to his list of class skills. He does not gain Climb, Ride, and Swim as class skills. This alters the magus's skills.
Spells				KEY:Puppetmaster ~ Spells										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.MagusKnowledgePool.MagusGreaterSpellAccess																																																																																																							DESC:A puppetmaster can cast spells from the bard and magus spell lists, and treats bard spells as magus spells. Because he does not have a bardic performance ability, some bard spells (which modify or require bardic performance) are poor choices for a puppetmaster. He must add bard spells to his spellbook prior to preparing them as normal. A puppetmaster can learn bard spells from a formula book or spellbook (if they are also alchemist extracts or wizard spells) or a scroll (as if learning a wizard spell from a scroll), or can select them to be one or more of the two magus spells he adds to his spellbook at each magus level. This replaces knowledge pool and greater spell access.
Arcane Pool				KEY:Puppetmaster ~ Arcane Pool									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.MagusArcanePool																																																																																																											DESC:A puppetmaster cannot expend points from his arcane pool to grant enhancement bonuses or weapon special abilities to a weapon he is holding. As a swift action whenever the puppetmaster casts a spell of the enchantment or illusion school, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to increase the spell's save DC or caster level by 1. At 7th level, the increase to the spell's save DC or caster level changes to 2, at 13th level to 3, and at 19th to 4. This alters the magus's arcane pool ability.
Puppet Combat			KEY:Puppetmaster ~ Puppet Combat									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.MagusSpellCombat.MagusImprovedSpellCombat.MagusGreaterSpellCombat																																																																																																			DESC:A puppetmaster can use spell combat, improved spell combat, and greater spell combat only with spells of the enchantment and illusion schools of magic. This ability alters spell combat, improved spell combat, and greater spell combat.
Charmstrike				KEY:Puppetmaster ~ Charmstrike									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.MagusSpellStrike.MagusFighterTraining.MagusCounterstrike																																																																																																				DESC:At 2nd level, as a swift action when a foe fails a saving throw against a spell (but not a spelllike or supernatural ability) cast by a puppetmaster, the puppetmaster can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to cast a prepared 1st-level enchantment on the foe. The foe must be one that the spell can target, and is the only creature affected (even if the spell can normally target multiple creatures). At 10th level, the puppetmaster can instead cast a 2nd-level enchantment spell on the foe, and at 16th level, a 3rd-level enchantment spell. The prepared spell is expended, as if cast normally. This ability replaces spellstrike, fighter training, and counterstrike.
The Show Must Go On		KEY:Puppetmaster ~ The Show Must Go On								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.MagusArmorProficiency																																																																																																										DESC:When a puppetmaster has a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell and that creature has line of sight to an illusion spell the puppetmaster has cast with a duration of concentration, the puppetmaster can link the illusion spell to the enchanted target. As long as the target has line of sight to the illusion and is enchanted, and the puppetmaster has line of sight to both the target and the illusion, the puppetmaster can maintain the illusion as a free action each round. The puppetmaster can maintain only one illusion spell in this way. At 13th level, the puppetmaster can maintain two illusion spells in this way, requiring a separate enchanted target for each illusion. This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor.
Scene Stealer			KEY:Puppetmaster ~ Scene Stealer									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.MagusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.MagusTrueMagus																																																																																																											DESC:At 20th level, if a puppetmaster successfully disbelieves an illusion, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to try to negate or steal control of the illusion. The puppetmaster attempts a caster level check as if he were dispelling the effect with dispel magic. If he succeeds, he can either end the effect or alter it as if he were the spell's caster. If the spell's duration is concentration, the puppetmaster must concentrate on the new effect (or transfer it to an enchanted target using the show must go on) or it ends. This ability replaces true magus.

# Rhetorician
Debater				KEY:Rhetorician ~ Debater										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.WitchHexLvl1																																																																																																									DESC:A rhetorician is an expert at making counterarguments and treating everything as a debate. When an opponent attempts a Diplomacy check to change another target's attitude or request aid, the rhetorician can attempt to make a counterargument to negate the opponent's efforts. The rhetorician attempts a Diplomacy check as an immediate action, with a DC equal to the result of the opponent's Diplomacy check. The target of the opponent's Diplomacy check must be able to see and hear the rhetorician. If the rhetorician's Diplomacy check is successful, the opponent's Diplomacy check fails. This ability replaces the hex gained at 1st level.
Eldritch Glibness			KEY:Rhetorician ~ Eldritch Glibness									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WitchPatronSpells																																																																																																											DESC:At 2nd level and every two witch levels thereafter, a rhetorician gains the following spells as spells known at the spell levels listed in parentheses. These spells are automatically added to the list of spells stored by her familiar. She treats these as being on the witch class spell list: 2nd—confusion, lesser (1st), 4th—detect thoughts (2nd), 6th—glibness (3rd), 8th—sculpt sound (4th), 10th—modify memory (5th), 12th—symbol of persuasion (6th), 14th—song of discord (7th), 16th—greater shout (8th), 18th— weird (9th). This ability replaces all the spells the witch gains from her patron.
Public Speaker			KEY:Rhetorician ~ Public Speaker									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WitchClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																																																											DESC:A rhetorician gains Perform as a class skill. In addition, she is trained to project her voice with great skill and effect; the DC to hear her speak in difficult conditions is reduced by an amount equal to her class level + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 0).

# Stone Warder
Blood of the Earth		KEY:Stone Warder ~ Blood of the Earth								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Sorcerer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																																																																													DESC:Stone warders must have a bloodline with strong ties to earth and rock. A stone warder must select the deep earth, draconic (copper dragon only), elemental (earth only), orc (Pathfinder Player Companion: Orcs of Golarion 14), or shaitan bloodline.
Power of Stone			KEY:Stone Warder ~ Power of Stone									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Sorcerer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																																																																													DESC:A stone warder draws power from natural rock, and gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when in hills, mountains, or underground terrain. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level, and by an additional 1 every 5 sorcerer levels thereafter. However, this strong elemental tie prevents a stone warder from casting spells that have the air, cold, electricity, fire, or water descriptor.
Rune of Warding			KEY:Stone Warder ~ Rune of Warding									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Sorcerer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SorcererEschewMaterials.SorcererBloodlineFeat7.SorcererBloodlineSpell3																																																																																																	DESC:As a standard action, a stone warder can create a warding rune in any adjacent square. The stone warder selects a sorcerer spell known that is at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast, and casts it as part of creating the rune of warding. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and it must target one or more creatures. Rather than have its normal effect, the spell is stored in the rune. The first creature to enter the square triggers the rune of warding, and becomes the target of the selected spell. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it affects only the creature that triggers the rune. The rune is invisible and lasts a number of rounds equal to the stone warder's level or until discharged. If placed on a solid rock or stone surface, it instead lasts 1 minute per sorcerer level the stone warder has or until discharged. The stone warder cannot create a rune of warding in a square occupied by an existing rune of warding or another creature. The rune counts as a spell of the same level as the spell stored within it for the purposes of dispelling. It is considered a magic trap and can be discovered with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell) and disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell). The stone warder can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.&nl;This ability replaces Eschew Materials, the bloodline spell gained at 3rd level, and the bloodline feat gained at 7th level.

# Sword Binder
Arcane Bond				KEY:Sword Binder ~ Arcane Bond									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WizardArcaneBond																																																																																																											DESC:A sword binder must choose a sword as his bonded item. He gains proficiency with it. This alters arcane bond.
Sword of the Mage			KEY:Sword Binder ~ Sword of the Mage								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.WizardClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.WizardArcaneSchool.Supernatural																																																																																																								DESC:A sword binder can send his bound sword to strike his foes. He gains the hand of the apprentice ability of the universalist school, but can use that ability only with his bound sword. His range with the ability is close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 wizard levels he possesses), and he can use it a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier + 1/2 his level.&nl;At 5th level, whenever the sword binder casts a spell with a range of touch from the wizard spell list, he can use his bonded sword to deliver the touch attack, including expending a daily use of hand of the apprentice to make the touch attack at range. This occurs as part of the same action as casting the spell. He gains all the attack bonuses that apply to his sword (including enhancement bonuses and relevant feats), but does not add his sword's damage or effects to the touch spell.&nl;At 8th level, when a sword binder casts a ranged touch spell or activates this ability to cast a touch spell through it, he can send his bound sword to deliver the spell and strike the target in one motion. Rather than a touch attack, he makes a ranged attack with the sword. If the sword hits, it deals normal weapon damage for hand of the apprentice and the spell automatically hits that target. If the sword misses, the spell lingers on the weapon and the sword binder can attempt to deliver the spell again by activating this ability as a standard action. If the sword binder drops or sheaths the weapon with the spell's charge still held, the charge dissipates to no effect.&nl;This ability replaces arcane school and bonus school spell slots.

Arcane Discovery		KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Arcane Discovery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality							DESC:An arcanist who selects this arcanistb exploit learns an arcane discovery (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 86). When she learns an arcane discovery, her level must be high enough for her to qualify for that discovery, using half her arcanist level as her wizard level to determine whether she qualifies. The effects of any arcane discovery that she selects with this exploit apply only to arcanist spells that she casts, not to wizard spells, and she cannot select an arcane discovery in place of a feat (unless she also has wizard levels, in which case the discovery applies only to her wizard spells).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Discovery|1
Philanthropic Magic	KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Philanthropic Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DESC:Whenever the arcanist targets one or more allies (excluding herself ) with a spell, she can expend 1 arcane point from her arcane reservoir in order to grant those allies a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell's level. These temporary hit points stack with temporary hit points from other sources, but temporary hit points from multiple uses of this exploit don't stack with each other. The temporary hit points last 1 minute per caster level or until expended.
Primal Magic		KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Primal Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESCISPI:YES	DESC:In seeking to restore formal training in magic to the world, Old-Mage Jatembe also discovered a few methods of creating magic effects that did not follow consistent or logical rules. While his only known remaining notes on these more chaotic forms of magic are closely guarded within the Magaambya, some arcanists have either recreated his theories from vague comments on other topics or independently rediscovered the methods Jatembe first detailed. This "primal magic" can be accessed one of two ways.&nl; The arcanist can expend 1 or more points from her arcane reservoir to create an uncontrolled primal effect. This creates an effect from the Sample Primal Magic Events table. The CR of this effect is equal to the arcanist's caster level, to a maximum caster level of 5 per point spent from her arcane reserve. In this case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to half its CR (maximum spell level 9).&nl; Alternatively, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and expend a spell slot of at least 3rd level to create an effect as if she has used a rod of wonder. Any spell created by the rod of wonder effect uses the arcanist's spell level, rather than the spell level set by the rod of wonder table (for example a fireball created by an 8th level arcanist rolling on the rod of wonder table would deal 8d6, rather than the listed 6d6). In this case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to the spell slot expended.

#Bardic Masterpiece
Arrowsong's Lament	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Arrowsong's Lament		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece					DESC:Rather than a single work, this masterpiece is a collection of poems from Arrowsong's days living under her scholarly parents, who both desperately wanted their daughter to pursue the art of wizardry. Despite the poems' wry tone and the overall distaste for book-learning they proclaim, Arrowsong's verse perfectly documents the process of memorizing arcane spells. When you gain this masterpiece, it becomes associated with your bard spells of a specific spell level. If you paid the masterpiece's cost by spending a bard spell you know, the masterpiece is associated with spells of the spent spell's level. If you paid the masterpiece's cost by spending a feat, you choose one bard spell level that you are able to cast with which to associate the masterpiece.&nl; In order to perform this masterpiece, you must be holding a spellbook, scroll, or a similar piece of arcane writing to consult. After completing the masterpiece, choose one arcane spell from your bard spell list or from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is written on the arcane writing that you consulted during the masterpiece. If the spell is on your bard spell list, it must be of the same level (or lower) as the spell level associated with this masterpiece. If the spell is not on your bard spell list, its level must be at least 2 spell levels lower than the spell level associated with this masterpiece. Add the chosen spell to the bard spell list and to your list of bard spells known until the next time that you rest and regain spells.&nl; If you use a spellbook with a preparation ritual to perform the masterpiece, you also gain the boon associated with that spellbook, as if you had prepared a spell from it. You can add up to one spell per spell level that you have selected with this masterpiece to your list of bard spells known each day. You can gain this masterpiece multiple times. Each time, you must apply it to a different bard spell level.&nl;Use: 3 rounds of bardic performance per level of the spell.&nl; Action: 1 hour of meditation.

Orichalcum Dust										KEY:Anointing ~ Orichalcum Dust			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Anointing.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																																																																																																										DESC:The alchemist sprinkles a small quantity of colorful dust that comprises the essence of all four elements. By favoring one element over another in this mixture, the alchemist temporarily changes the energy type of one weapon into another. For example, the alchemist can choose for a bomb to deal acid damage or a weapon with the shocking burst special ability to deal fire damage instead. Once an elemental effect is changed, it cannot be changed again until the anointing's duration expires.
