The weapon functions as normal, but any creature that touches it, or that it strikes, takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round it remains in contact. In addition, the weapon emanates an aura of radiation that causes blightburn sickness. This is as the disease, but with a 10-foot radius and a save DC equal to this spell's save DC.
Chameleon Scales				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=0|Alchemist,Ranger=1						SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]		SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.26		DESC:You temporarily alter the color of your skin, hide, or scales to another option legal for your race. You take no penalty for using Disguise to appear as a member of a different race as long as that race has the same type and color of skin, hide, or scales as you.
Dark-Light					TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Light			COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Living creatures without light sensitivity, 20-ft. burst	DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.26		DESC:You evoke a powerful light that affects all sighted creatures that do not posses light sensitivity. Those that succeed on their saves are dazzled for 1 round per level; those who fail are blinded for the same duration.
Enlarge Tail				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Alchemist,Antipaladin,Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:Your tail									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:When attacking with your tail or tail weapons, you gain 5 feet of reach, a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 bonus on damage rolls.
Lead Plating				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2|Alchemist=3				SCHOOL:Conjuration			SUBSCHOOL:Creation							COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:A creature or object weighing up to (CASTERLEVEL*100) lbs	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]			SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:You enclose the target in a thin sheath of lead. This doesn't restrict the target's movement or functionality, but protects it from the effects of radiation and prevents the penetration of many divination spells. The lead doesn't coat the target's equipment.
Shadow Dragon Aspect			TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=4									SCHOOL:Illusion				SUBSCHOOL:Shadow			DESCRIPTOR:Shadow			COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (see text)		SPELLRES:Yes, see text			SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:You wreathe yourself in the quasi-real form of a dragon. You gain two claw attacks (1d6+(CASTERLEVEL) slashing damage) and a bite attack (1d8+(CASTERLEVEL) piercing damage). These are primary attacks. In addition, you gain shadowy wings, granting you a fly speed equal to your base speed (good maneuverability). Your shadowy natural weapons are only half as strong as the real things, though creatures that believe them to be real are affected at full strength. A creature is permitted one Will save the first time you strike it. If it succeeds, the creature takes half damage from such attacks for the duration of the spell. If you overcome a creature's spell resistance on your first attack, that creature remains vulnerable for the spell's duration; otherwise, it's immune.
Strip Scales				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid=4|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5								SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:You reduce the target's racial natural armor bonus by (CASTERLEVEL/3) points.
Unseen Engineers				TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Summoner=2|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3							SCHOOL:Conjuration			SUBSCHOOL:Creation							COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Long		TARGETAREA:A team of tiny, invisible engineers					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.27		DESC:You conjure an invisible team of tiny engineers to construct a trap at alarming speed. Originating at your location, the team must remain within range of you or the spell ends. The engineers construct a mechanical trap of your choice. Construction takes a number of rounds equal to the trap's challenge rating. The engineers must have the materials available. At the end of the construction time, use your Craft(traps) skill with a +5 bonus to determine the success of their work. If the engineers succeed, the trap is complete and the spell ends. If they fail, the materials are deposited at that location and the spell ends. If the spell's duration ends before the trap is complete, the engineers automatically fail. The engineers move at your base speed and can carry only materials required in the construction of the desired trap. They can't attack in any way or be killed, and dissipate if they take 12 points of damage from area attacks (they get no saves against attacks).
