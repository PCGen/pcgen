##Unable to make Blinded Blade, et al, SERVEAS skill levels.
Blinded Blade Style				CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:Combat.Style			PRESKILL:1,Perception=5		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blind-Fight																		PRETEXT:Blind-Fight, Perception 5 ranks																											DESC:You hold no fear of blindness, as your other senses improve without the distractions of sight.							SOURCEPAGE:p.24			BENEFIT:While you are using this style, you gain a number of benefits whenever you are blinded or unable to see (including when you wear a blindfold or close your eyes). Under such circumstances, you do not take any penalties on Strength- or Dexterity-based skill checks due to blindness. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on hearing- and smell-based Perception checks and gain the scent special ability with a range of 10 feet; if you already have scent, the range of your scent ability increases by 10 feet instead. Having this feat counts as having 10 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Improved Blind-Fightfeat, as well as any feat that lists Improved Blind-Fight as a prerequisite.				BONUS:SITUATION|Perception=Hearing or smell based|4			SERVESAS:ABILITY=FEAT|Improved Blind-Fight
Blinded Competence				CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:Combat.Style			PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blinded Blade Style],[PRESKILL:1,Perception=10]		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blinded Blade Style,Improved Blind-Fight		PRETEXT:Blinded Blade Style, Blind-Fight, Improved Blind-Fight, Perception 10 ranks																				DESC:Your lack of sight enables you to strike your foes with uncanny precision.										SOURCEPAGE:p.24			BENEFIT:While you are using Blinded Blade Style and you are blinded or unable to see, you do not need to succeed at Perception checks to pinpoint the location of creatures within reach of your melee weapon, or your unmodified reach if you are not wielding a melee weapon. This ability functions like blindsense, except creatures you cannot see do not gain total concealment against you. Having this feat counts as having 15 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Greater Blind-Fight feat, as well as any feat that lists Greater Blind-Fight as a prerequisite.			SERVESAS:ABILITY=FEAT|Greater Blind-Fight
Blinded Master					CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:Combat.Style			PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blinded Competence],[PRESKILL:1,Perception=15]		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blinded Competence,Greater Blind-Fight			PRETEXT:Blind-Fight, Blinded Competence, Blinded Blade Style, Greater Blind-Fight, Improved Blind-Fight, Perception 15 ranks													DESC:Your skill at arms while unable to see is astounding.														SOURCEPAGE:p.24			BENEFIT:While you are using Blinded Blade Style and you are blinded or unable to see, your ability to pinpoint creatures' locations using Blinded Competence improves to function like blindsight rather than blindsense, and the range increases to 30 feet.

SOURCEPAGE:p.24			BENEFIT:Choose one light melee weapon. While using this style, whenever you use the attack action to attack an opponent during a surprise round with your chosen weapon, you can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check against that opponent as a free action. Additionally, if an adjacent target attempts to remove a condition that you inflicted upon it with the dirty trick combat maneuver, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. Special: In addition to the chosen weapon, a character with the weapon training class feature can use Cloak and Dagger Style with any light melee weapon belonging to any fighter weapon group he has selected with weapon training. A character with the swashbuckler weapon training class feature can use Cloak and Dagger Style with light and one-handed piercing weapons.
Cloak and Dagger Subterfuge			CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:Combat.Style			PRETOTALAB:11			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cloak and Dagger Style																PRETEXT:Int 13, Cloak and Dagger Style, Combat Expertise, Improved Dirty Trick, Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +11										DESC:You take advantage of distracted foes to easily impose conditions, and even steal items without being noticed.				SOURCEPAGE:p.25			BENEFIT:While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you make an attack of opportunity against a target, you can attempt a free dirty trick combat maneuver check against the target as a free action as well. Additionally, whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick maneuver against a target, you can immediately attempt a steal combat maneuver check against the target as a free action. If you succeed, the target is unaware you have stolen an item.
Cloak and Dagger Tactics			CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:Combat.Style			PRETOTALAB:16			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cloak and Dagger Subterfuge															PRETEXT:Int 13, Cloak and Dagger Style, Cloak and Dagger Subterfuge, Combat Expertise, Improved Dirty Trick, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +16.			DESC:You devastate enemies that you catch off-guard.															SOURCEPAGE:p.25			BENEFIT:While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you hit an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC or that you are flanking, or make an attack using Vital Strike (or its improved or greater versions), you can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check against that opponent as a free action. If you succeed, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC %1) or take an additional penalty from the dirty trick selected from the following list: anchored in place and unable to move from that square, confused, exhausted, or staggered. This additional penalty lasts only 1 round, regardless of how long the dirty trick's normal penalty lasts, and can be removed by the target with a standard action. You can only attempt one free dirty trick combat maneuver check per round using this feat.|10+(BAB/2)+INT
Eclipsed Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:Metamagic																																																																	DESC:You alter how your spells affect illumination.

If the eclipsed spell creates an area that shines like daylight or raises the light level by two steps, you can choose to have the spell lower the illumination level in the affected area by two steps and create an area of magical darkness, functioning like deeper darkness. If the eclipsed spell lowers the illumination level in the affected area by one step, you can choose to have the spell cause the affected area to glow with normal light, functioning like light. If the eclipsed spell lowers the illumination level in the affected area by two steps, you can choose to have the spell cause the affected area to shed bright light, functioning like daylight. An eclipsed spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.

In addition, your shadow jump ability counts as the ability to cast dimension door for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Dimensional Agility feat as well as any feat that lists that feat as a prerequisite, and your shadow jump benefits from such feats as if you were casting dimension door.
Snuffing Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT				TYPE:Metamagic																																																																	DESC:Your magic disrupts sources of light.																SOURCEPAGE:p.25			BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to extinguish magical and nonmagical light sources that the target has.

Spells that do not target creatures can't be snuffing spells. A snuffing spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.		ADDSPELLLEVEL:2
