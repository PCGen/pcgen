This feat allows you to fire your sling as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
Large Target	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																				PREWEAPONPROF:1,Sling,Sling Staff (Halfling),Sling (Double)	DESC:The larger a creature is, the easier you find it to strike a vulnerable spot when attacking with a sling.

The sling deals 1d4 nonlethal bludgeoning damage (1d6 for a Medium wielder), threatens a critical hit on a 20, and deals x2 damage on a critical hit. If the sling isn't loaded with ammunition when you make an attack of opportunity, you take a -4 penalty on the attack roll.

SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT: When you attempt to jinx a creature, you can expend one of your prepared arcane spells or available arcane spell slots to give your target a penalty on its jinx save equal to the level of the expended spell or spell slot. This does not alter the effect of the jinx, only the saving throw to resist the jinx.

Any creature within this burst, regardless of whether or not you can see it, must make a saving throw to resist your jinx. If you use your jinx again, all of your current jinxes immediately end.|AreaJinxRange
Bolster Jinx	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Jinx.WizardBonus	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Halfling ~ Jinx	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Great Fortitude,Iron Will,Lightning Reflexes																										DESC:Your ability to resist certain effects somehow makes it even harder for creatures you jinx to do the same.															SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:A jinxed target's penalty on Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saves increases by 2 if you have the Great Fortitude, Lightning Reflexes, or Iron Will feat, respectively. If you have more than one of these feats, the additional penalties apply to all of the corresponding saves.

SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:If you jinx a creature under the effect of a bard's fascinate ability, it also takes a -10 penalty on initiative checks while affected by the jinx.

Jinx Alchemy	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Jinx.WizardBonus	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Halfling ~ Jinx,Alchemist ~ Swift Alchemy																																	DESC:With your knowledge of alchemy, creatures you jinx cannot benefit from most sorts of alchemical compounds.															SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:A jinxed creature cannot benefit from the effects of potions, elixirs, or any other substance that he must ingest in order to activate. This includes alchemical substances such as antitoxin, but not extracts, mutagens, or other alchemist class abilities that only affect the alchemist. A jinxed creature still takes any penalties and detrimental effects from ingested compounds or poisons.
Jinxed Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Jinx.Metamagic	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Halfling ~ Jinx	PREABILITY:2,CHECKMULT,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																													DESC:You can make a creature that fails its spell save suffer your jinx as well.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:Any creature that fails its saving throw against a jinxed spell also suffers the effects of your jinx. This feat has no effect on spells that do not allow a saving throw. If the spell affects an area or multiple creatures, you must select one creature to take the jinx, unless you have the Area Jinx feat; if you have the Area Jinx feat, choose a jinx burst area within the spell's area or among its targets and apply the jinx to those in the burst that failed their save. A jinxed spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Malicious Eye	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Jinx.WizardBonus	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Halfling ~ Jinx,WitchHex ~ Evil Eye																																		DESC:You can combine the effects of your evil eye and your jinx.

SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:Your jinx's penalty on saving throws also applies to the target's initiative and attack rolls.
