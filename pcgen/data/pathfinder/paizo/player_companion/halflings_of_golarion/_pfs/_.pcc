DESC:Since the birth of modern fantasy fiction, halflings have been the incongruous, pint-sized adventurers at the center of it all, constantly overlooked and dismissed by their enemies, only to end up overcoming all odds. Nowhere is this more true than in the Player Companion, where plucky and courageous halflings do their best to integrate into the societies of larger races, where they're frequently preyed upon by slavers and malicious employers. Yet despite such adversity, halflings maintain a notoriously positive outlook and an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time. Those who disregard halflings based on their size do so at their peril, for you never know when that smiling servant might slip your coins into his pocket-or his knife into your back. Put some hair on your toes with this new Player Companion.
