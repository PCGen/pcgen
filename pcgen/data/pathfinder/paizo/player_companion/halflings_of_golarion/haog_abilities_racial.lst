This curse has a range of %1 feet, and you must be able to see the target and have line of effect to it. The target gets a Will saving throw to resist this jinx (%2 DC). If your target makes this saving throw, it is immune to your jinx ability for 24 hours. A jinxed creature takes a -1 penalty on all saving throws. This jinx lasts for 24 hours or until you attempt to use your jinx again. A jinx is a supernatural ability, is not mind-affecting, does not allow spell resistance, and can affect any kind of creature not immune to luck effects.|HalflingJinxRange|HalflingJinxDC	BONUS:VAR|HalflingJinxDC|10+(TL/2)+CHA	BONUS:VAR|HalflingJinxRange|30	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.27
