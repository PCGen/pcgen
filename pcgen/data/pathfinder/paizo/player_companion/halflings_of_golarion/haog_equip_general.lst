# Cleanup
#Black Bead					TYPE:		COST:		WT:		SOURCEPAGE:p.24	SPROP:Usually a trophy seized from a foe, this bead often commemorates tasks involving defeating a threat through manipulation or deception rather than direct action. A halfling who uses the bead while casting cause fear can target multiple creatures within range of the spell so long as their total Hit Dice does not exceed 5. A creature that fails its saving throw becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds; a successful save means that the spell has no effect.
#Blessed Button				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.24 SPROP:This brass button often commemorates tasks requiring the youth to destroy or drive off a threat to the community without directly engaging it in handto-hand combat. A halfling who uses it while casting bless weapon on a sling affects enables the sling to confer the spell's benefits to the ammunition it fires.
#Constable's Nail				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.24 SPROP: This bent iron nail is often given to young halflings to commemorate tasks involving capturing a criminal or another outlaw and bringing her safely to trial. A halfling who uses it while casting magic weapon may have the spell give the weapon the merciful ability instead of an enhancement bonus. In the hands of anyone but the caster, the weapon loses the merciful ability and reverts to the normal effect of magic weapon.
#Decisive Game Piece				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.24 SPROP: This object, gathered from a larger set of game pieces, often commemorates tasks involving gaining a strategic advantage over a more powerful foe. A halfling who uses it while casting bane may give opponents who fail their saves a -2 penalty to CMD instead of the normal spell effect.
#Half-Deck				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.24 SPROP: This partially intact deck of cards often commemorates tasks in which the young halfling must successfully take calculated risks in order to achieve a noteworthy goal. A halfling who uses it while casting divine favor gains a luck bonus on all skill and ability checks instead of on attack and damage rolls.
#Harvester's Pouch				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.24 SPROP: This simple leather pouch, designed to dangle from a belt so the wearer could easily drop freshly picked fruits or vegetables into it, often commemorates tasks in which the halfling provided food for the elderly or infirm. A halfling who uses it while casting goodberry can focus all of the spell's magic into a single berry. If eaten, this berry cures 1 point of ability damage. A creature can only benefit from this version of the spell once during any given 24-hour period.
#Jagged Dice				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.24 SPROP: This pair of ruined dice is often given to young halflings to commemorate tasks that involve coordinating a group in order to accomplish something that benefits the community as a whole. A halfling who uses it while casting deathwatch can, instead of learning about the injuries of nearby creatures, gain a rough understanding of their relative power. The GM should offer a ranking of creatures by their CR (without stating their actual CR) from most powerful to least.
#Knotted Strap				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.25 SPROP: This coarse bit of leather, drawn into a tight loop, often commemorates tasks involving defending a wild place from encroaching civilization. A halfling who uses it while casting shillelagh can cast the spell on a sling to give it the abilities of a +1 sling. Ammunition launched from this sling deals damage as if fired by a Large creature (bullets 1d6, stones 1d4) regardless of the halfling's current size. If not wielded by the caster, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by this spell.
#Midnight Bandana				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.25 SPROP: This dark bit of cloth often commemorates tasks involving eliminating a threat to the community by stealth or sabotage. A halfling who wears it while casting sanctuary on herself can cause the spell to affect only one creature instead of all opponents within range. This creature gets a saving throw as normal to resist the effects of the spell. If it fails this saving throw, the halfling can attack it without automatically ending the spell. Each round in which the halfling makes an attack against the target, regardless of the number of attacks or whether or not any actually succeed, the target may make another saving throw in order to overcome the spell and retaliate. Whenever the halfling successfully strikes the target, she reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 1 round. For instance, if the spell had 5 rounds remaining and the halfling struck the target three times in a single round, the spell has only 2 rounds left on its duration.
#Noble Needle				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.25 SPROP: This sharp, sturdy needle often commemorates tasks that involve great risks or sacrifices. A halfling who uses it while casting cure light wounds can deal up to 1 hit point of damage/level (maximum 5) to herself and then add this amount to the number of hit points recovered by the target of the spell.
#Persuasive Arrowhead				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.25 SPROP: This arrow fragment often commemorates tasks involving protecting a specific animal from hunters or other threats. A halfling who uses it while casting charm animal gains a +10 bonus on Handle Animal checks regarding the charmed animal.
#Resilient Spring				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.25 SPROP: This tightly wound spring often commemorates tasks that involve great physical prowess. A halfling who uses it while casting jump can, as a swift action, choose to sacrifice some or all of the spell's bonus on Acrobatics checks (up to a maximum of her caster level) for the remaining duration of the spell in order to gain an equal bonus on any one skill or ability check that turn relating to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
#Trainer's Whistle				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.24 SPROP: This simple whistle often commemorates tasks in which the halfling finds ways to eliminate the threat posed by particular sorts of animals without actually killing them. A halfling can, when first gaining this keepsake, designate one specific kind of animal (bears, wolves, cats, and so on) for which she has a particular affinity. When she uses the keepsake while casting calm animals, she can affect her chosen animal kind plus one other kind of animal (instead of the spell's normal limitation of affecting only one kind of animal). Alternatively, she can only affect her chosen kind of animal, and then adds her caster level to the number of HD of animals affected (this is in addition to the normal 2d4 + caster level worth of HD affected).
#Vital Cup				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0D	SOURCEPAGE:p.25 SPROP: This battered clay cup often commemorates tasks involving making the community a safer and more wholesome place. A halfling who uses this cup while casting bless water can pour the resulting water on one weapon or piece of ammunition to imbue it with the power of the holy water. The first creature the halfling strikes with this weapon during the next 24 hours takes additional damage as if it had been struck by a flask of holy water (assuming the creature is harmed by holy water).
#Whirling Earring				TYPE:MaterialComponent.Focus		COST:0		WT:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.25		SPROP: Usually fashioned from a broken shield or armor, this bent earring often commemorates tasks involving daring risks which paid off not so much through skill or cunning but rather by sheer luck. A halfling who uses the earring to cast entropic shield can, as an immediate action, end the spell to make a ranged attack against her automatically miss. She must make this decision before the attacker actually makes the attack roll.
