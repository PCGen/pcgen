# Unchained Monk Ki Powers
# ==============================

Ki Meditation				KEY:Unchained Ki Power ~ Ki Meditation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unchained Ki Power.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Meditation						SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:A monk with this ability can spend 2 ki points to meditate as a full-round action, as if using Combat Meditation. Alternatively, he can spend 4 ki points to meditate as a move action instead. Using these ki points does not count as one of the monk's daily uses of Combat Meditation, but it grants him the usual benefits he would gain from his meditation feats for doing so. The monk must have the Combat Meditation feat before selecting this ki power.
