# Modifier Name		Unique Key				Type				Plus		Visible		Source Page		Required Type							Special Property
Clustershot			KEY:Clustershot			TYPE:Arrow.Ammunition	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Ammunition	PRETYPE:1,Arrow	SPROP:These arrows are inscribed with a spiral groove down the length of the haft and an eye-glyph on the head. They are designed to maintain accuracy when firing multiple arrows at the same time (such as with the Manyshot feat) by steering their paths toward the impact point of the first arrow. For a clustershot arrow to function, all arrows fired in the attack must have this property. If the first arrow can deal sneak attack damage or is a critical hit, the remaining arrows from that shot can deal half normal sneak attack damage, and if they critically hit deal half normal critical hit damage.
Healer's Sorrow		KEY:Healer's Sorrow		TYPE:Arrow.Ammunition	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Ammunition	PRETYPE:1,Arrow	SPROP:The sickly gray wood of this arrow seems quite fragile and delicate. Created from pale necromantic bone or casket wood, this arrow splinters when it impacts, embedding pieces of itself in the target and making the wound resistant to magical healing. Removing the splinters requires 10 minutes and a DC 25 Heal check. Until the splinters are removed, all magical healing effects used on the target restore only half as many hit points as normal. This applies whether the target requires positive or negative energy for healing.
Sparkfly Crystal Arrow	KEY:Sparkfly Crystal Arrow	TYPE:Arrow.Ammunition	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Ammunition	PRETYPE:1,Arrow	SPROP:The fat crystal head of this arrow contains tiny motes of light; on closer scrutiny, they are actually tiny glowing insects similar to fireflies, held in stasis. When the arrow hits a target, it shatters the crystal and releases the insects, which distract the target with their aggressive flight. The creature takes a -1 penalty on attacks and checks for the next minute or until they rid themselves of the flying pests (such as by diving into water, suffering a damaging area attack, and so on). The lights reduce a target's concealment by one step (turning a 50%% miss chance from total concealment into a 20%% miss chance from concealment, and concealment into no concealment at all).
