Consume Life							KEY:Twilight Sage ~ Consume Life					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Features.TwilightSageClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural											SOURCEPAGE:p.6		DESC:By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power. As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living creature, killing it. This creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the creature's Hit Dice were %1 or more, or 1 point if the creature's Hit Dice were at least %2. This ability is a death effect.|ArcanistLVL|ArcanistLVL/2
Necromantic Focus							KEY:Twilight Sage ~ Necromantic Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Features.TwilightSageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.6		DESC:Twilight sages consider their research into life and death to be paramount, beyond all other concerns. Each day, a twilight sage must prepare at least one necromancy spell of each spell level she can cast.
Twilight Barrier							KEY:Twilight Sage ~ Twilight Barrier				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Features.TwilightSageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:A twilight sage's arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists, as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage's arcane barrier, the barrier's negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing %1 points of negative energy damage.|ArcaneBarrierHP			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Arcanist Exploit ~ Arcane Barrier
Twilight Transfer							KEY:Twilight Sage ~ Twilight Transfer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Features.TwilightSageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:A twilight sage's mastery over life and death allows her to transfer life energy into a fading vessel. Once per day, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir while touching a creature that died within the past round to affect that creature as if it had received a breath of life spell, using her arcanist level as the caster level. At the same time, a willing or unconscious living creature within 300 feet that has a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the recipient's instantly dies. This ability is a death effect, and if the victim doesn't actually die (such as if it was summoned or is immune to death effects), the recipient doesn't receive the breath of life effect. 
Death's Release							KEY:Twilight Sage ~ Death's Release					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Features.TwilightSageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural											SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:A twilight sage has mastered the relationship between death and arcane power, and has gained a limited ability to surpass her own mortality. Whenever she dies (but not if she becomes undead), if she still has points in her arcane reservoir she appears as an ephemeral spirit in the air above her corpse. She can still cast spells in this form, using her corpse as the origin point and determining whether she can see or target any creature or area as though she were alive in that square. To cast a spell, she must expend a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the spell's level. The spirit disappears if she has no points remaining in her arcane reservoir or she spends a round without casting a spell. The spirit can't move, deliver touch or ranged touch spells, or do anything that isn't part of casting a spell. Her spirit completes the verbal and somatic components of her spells, any material components are consumed from the supply on the corpse, and any focus components must be on the corpse.

Altered Shifting							KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Altered Shifting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Arcanist Exploit ~ Lepidstadt Shifter			SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:When the arcanist is under the effect of a spell of the polymorph subschool that she cast, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to change to another valid form allowed by the spell. This reduces the spell's caster level by 1, which can take the spell's caster level below the minimum caster level necessary to cast the spell, and reduces the spell's duration if applicable.
First-World Face Thief						KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ First-World Face Thief			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to assume an illusory disguise as disguise self.

If the arcanist successfully disbelieves an illusion, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to try to negate or steal control of the illusion. The arcanist attempts a caster level check as if she were dispelling the effect with dispel magic. If she succeeds, she can either end the effect or alter it as if she were the spell's caster. If the spell's duration is concentration, the arcanist must concentrate on the new effect or it ends.
Lepidstadt Shifter			NAMEISPI:YES	KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Lepidstadt Shifter				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to cast a spell while under the effects of a polymorph spell. This ability works like Natural Spell, except the arcanist uses the ability to cast while under the effects of a spell instead of wild shape.
Nidalese Shadow Veil			NAMEISPI:YES	KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Nidalese Shadow Veil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, an arcanist can pull a veil of shadows around her, making her more difficult to spot and strike.

The blast deals %1d6+%2 sonic damage. The target is also deafened for 1 minute. The target can attempt a Fortitude save (DC %3) to halve the damage and negate the deafness.|MIN(10,((ArcanistLVL+1)/2))|CHA|10+ArcanistLVL/2+CHA

###Exploit version of the feat of the same name
Eldritch Aid							KEY:Arcanist Exploit ~ Eldritch Aid					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArcanistExploit.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																SOURCEPAGE:p.26		DESC:As a standard action, you can expend a 1st-level or higher prepared spell or spell slot to grant additional magic energy to an allied spellcaster within close range (%1 ft.). If that ally casts an instantaneous spell of an equal or lower level before the beginning of your next turn, all level-dependent calculations and caster level checks the spell requires are made as if the ally's caster level were 2 higher. If the prepared spell or spell slot you expended is at least twice the level of the spell your ally casts, your ally's caster level is treated as 4 higher instead. If your ally is able to cast more than one spell before the beginning of your next turn, only the first spell cast gains this bonus.|25+(5*ArcanistLVL/2)

If the attack hits, the Shackles corsair also pilfers a small, loose item from her target as if she had succeeded at a Sleight of Hand or steal combat maneuver check. She doesn't need to attempt a Sleight of Hand check, but if she does so and surpasses the target's opposed Perception check, the target is unaware that the item is stolen.	ASPECT:ChildAbility|Deeds
