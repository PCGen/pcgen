Acid Maw			TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=1							SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Acid					COMPS:V,S,DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:Your animal companion					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:Your animal companion's bite attack deals an additional 1d4 points of acid damage, and the acid deals another 1d4 points of acid damage to the target on the next round. The acid continues to deal damage for %1 additional rounds. This ongoing acid damage doesn't stack from multiple attacks, but the duration resets if a newer bite would cause the ongoing damage to last longer than the duration remaining from a previous one. The acid does not harm the animal companion.|MIN(5,(CASTERLEVEL/4))
Arcane Disruption		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Bloodrager,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Curse|Mind-Affecting		COMPS:V,S,M			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:This spell makes it difficult for the subject to cast arcane spells, use spell-like abilities, and use some abilities granted by arcane spellcasting classes. The subject must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + 1/2 its caster level) in order to cast an arcane spell, use any spell-like ability (even those that come from a divine source), use arcane spell completion or spell trigger magic items, or use any of the following class features that come from an arcane spellcasting class: arcane school powers, arcanist exploits, bardic performances, magus arcana, or witch hexes. Spells, spell-like abilities, or class features that take a free, swift, or immediate action aren't affected by this spell, nor are mythic spells or mythic powers. While under the effect of this spell, if the subject must attempt a concentration check to cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability for any reason other than the effect of this spell (such as casting defensively, being injured while casting, and so on), it takes a penalty on that check equal to 1/2 its caster level.
Blood Salvation		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bloodrager=3							SCHOOL:Abjuration													COMPS:V,S			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]; see text												SOURCEPAGE:p.30		DESC:While under the effect of this spell, you're immune to any damaging area spells you cast. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when you are caught within the area of someone else's damaging area spell; if you do, you're immune to that particular casting of that spell as well. If you have the blood casting class feature, you can cast this spell as a swift action instead of a standard action while you're in a bloodrage.
Defensive Grace		TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Investigator=5							SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V,S,M			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]; see text												SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:Each round you can roll an inspiration die without expending a use of inspiration and gain the result as a dodge bonus to AC for that round. You are immune to precision damage (including the extra damage from the precise strike deed, sneak attack, studied combat, and studied strike). If a critical hit is confirmed against you, you can dismiss this spell as an immediate action to negate the critical and make the attack instead deal normal damage.
Energy Hack			TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4						SCHOOL:Transmutation					VARIANTS:Acid|Cold|Electricity|Fire		COMPS:V			CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds; see text													SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:You can cast this spell only when you take 10 or more points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage from a spell or spell-like abilityâ€”this spell has the same energy descriptors as the damaging effect. When you use a spell or spell-like ability with the acid, cold, electricity, or fire descriptor or use an arcanist exploit, arcane school power, bloodline power, magus arcana, or hex that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you can choose to change the energy type and descriptor to match one of the descriptors of energy hack. Any other effect of that spell or power remains the same. If you have the arcane reservoir class feature, if you take another 10 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage while under the effect of energy hack, as a free action you can expend 1 point from your arcane reservoir to reset the duration of energy hack to 1 round per level and add the new type of damage you took to the list of energy types you can choose to substitute. You can expend points in this way multiple times as long as you do so before the duration expires.
Imbue Hex			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Shaman,Witch=5							SCHOOL:Evocation													COMPS:V,S,DF/M		CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Creature touched; see text				DURATION:Permanent or until discharged		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:You transfer a single hex you know to the target, and give that target the ability to use the hex. The transferred hex's variable characteristics function according to your level, not the level of the recipient. Only a creature with Intelligence and Wisdom scores of at least 9 can receive this effect. To use this hex, the target must be able to speak and move freely. Once it uses the hex, the spell ends (though any effects of the hex still last for the full duration). You can transfer only a hex-not a major or grand hex-with this ability. Once you cast imbue hex, you cannot use the transferred hex until the spell is discharged, dispelled, or dismissed.
Phantom Hunt		TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=4							SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V,S,DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal; see text	TARGETAREA:You and one animal companion within 30 ft.		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D]														SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:You affect yourself and a single animal companion within 30 feet of you. Both you and the animal companion gain darkvision to 100 feet, tremorsense to 20 feet, and a 40-foot enhancement bonus to movement. Furthermore, you can track while moving at full speed without taking any penalty. If you already have the ability to track at full speed, you gain a +4 bonus on Survival checks while tracking instead. The duration of this spell immediately ends if you or the animal companion attack another creature or are attacked by another creature.
Spirit Call			TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid,Shaman=1							SCHOOL:Enchantment												COMPS:V,S,DF		CASTTIME:1 full round		RANGE:100 ft.			TARGETAREA:100-ft.-radius spread centered on you		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes														SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:You call out to nature spirits associated with your spirit (not your wandering spirit) if you are a shaman, or your domain if you are a druid, beckoning them forth to pay attention to your current location. For the duration of the spell, all spells from your spirit magic list or domain list that are cast within the affected area have their caster level increased by 1, and all spellcasters casting such spells receive a +4 insight bonus on their concentration checks for those spells only.
Wrathful Weapon		TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=4								SCHOOL:Transmutation					VARIANTS:Good|Evil|Lawful|Chaotic		COMPS:V,S,DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Melee weapon touched; see text				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless,object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.31		DESC:You grant the targeted weapon one of the following weapon special abilities: anarchic, axiomatic, holy, or unholy. If anarchic, this spell has the chaos descriptor; if axiomatic, the law descriptor; if holy, the good descriptor; and if unholy, the evil descriptor. If the caster attempts to place a special ability on a weapon that already has that special ability, the spell fails. If a warpriest casts this spell on his sacred weapon, the duration doubles. Warpriests with unarmed strike as a sacred weapon can cast this spell on their unarmed strike.

##Bloodrager spell variant
Elemental Aura (Cold)	TYPE:Arcane													SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Cold					COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You								DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)			SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:CRB p.218	DESC:This spell forms an aura of energy around you, damaging all those that come near you. Creatures adjacent to you when this spell is cast and at the start of your turn take 2d6 points of cold damage. Creatures affected by your aura are fatigued. A creature that is already fatigued suffers no additional effect.  Creatures adjacent to you are allowed a Reflex save to halve the damage and negate the fatigue.
