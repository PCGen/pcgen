Ambush Sense					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:1,INT=13			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trap Sense												PRETEXT:Int 13, trap sense class feature.														DESC:You live in dangerous times, and are alert for betrayal or unexpected attack.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You gain a +%1 bonus on Perception checks made to determine awareness for the surprise round of combat, and a +%1 dodge bonus to AC in any surprise round in which you get to act.|TrapSenseBonus
Amplified Hex					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Witch ~ Hex,Shaman ~ Hex										PRETEXT:Hex class feature.																DESC:You have learned to augment your hexes with the energy of your spells.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You can augment the power of a hex by expending a spell slot or prepared spell of at least 1st level. Each additional time you use this ability in the same day, it requires a prepared spell or spell slot 1 level higher (a 2nd-level spell the second time, a 3rd level spell the third time, and so on). When you amplify a hex, you can choose one: increase its saving throw DC by 1, increase its range by 30 feet (if it already has at least a 30-foot range), or increase its duration by 1 round (if it already has a duration of at least 1 round).
Daggermark Lore		NAMEISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESKILL:1,Craft (Alchemy)=5	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Poison Use,Investigator ~ Poison Lore							PRETEXT:Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, member of the Daggermark Poisoner's Guild, poison lore or poison use class feature.	DESC:You understand the exclusive poisons brewed by your guild far better than the buyers you sell to, and you can deliver them so they are more difficult to weather.								SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:Choose one poison. When you deliver that poison, the number of saves needed to cure it increases by 1, and the DC to cure it with neutralize poison increases by 5. Succeeding at the initial save still negates the poison. Typical poisons used by Daggermark poisoners are listed in Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual and Pathfinder Chronicles: Guide to the River Kingdoms. Additionally, if you have the poison lore class feature, you're considered to have the poison use class feature for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

Eldritch Aid					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1																					PRETEXT:Caster level 1st.																DESC:You have been trained to expend your own spell energy to boost the effects of an ally's spell.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can expend a 1st-level or higher prepared spell or spell slot to grant additional magic energy to an allied spellcaster within close range (%1 ft.). If that ally casts an instantaneous spell of an equal or lower level before the beginning of your next turn, all level-dependent calculations and caster level checks the spell requires are made as if the ally's caster level were 2 higher. If the prepared spell or spell slot you expended is at least twice the level of the spell your ally casts, your ally's caster level is treated as 4 higher instead. If your ally is able to cast more than one spell before the beginning of your next turn, only the first spell cast gains this bonus.|25+(5*ArcanistLVL/2)
Expanded Spell Kenning				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Skald ~ Spell Kenning											PRETEXT:Spell kenning class feature.														DESC:You are learned in a broader range of spell traditions than most.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:When you use your spell kenning class feature, you can select a spell from either the druid or the witch spell list.
Expanded Studies					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESTAT:1,WIS=17			PRECLASS:1,Hunter=16,Warpriest=16															PRETEXT:Wis 17, hunter or warpriest level 16th.													DESC:You're part of a group or organization with access to greater magical mysteries than you understand yourself, and you have learned from your colleagues' eldritch expertise.						SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You add 7th-level spells to your spell list for purposes of using spell completion and spell trigger magic items. If you're a hunter, you add 7th-level druid spells to your list. If you're a warpriest, you add 7th-level cleric spells to your list. This doesn't give you the ability to cast spells of this level, only to act as though your spell list included them when using appropriate magic items. For example, a 16th-level hunter has access to druid spells of only 1st to 6th levels. Thus, the hunter can't use spell completion or spell trigger magic items of druid spells of 7th level or higher without succeeding at a Use Magic Device check. If the hunter takes Eldritch Studies, she doesn't gain the ability to cast 7th-level druid spells, but she could use a scroll of heal or a wand of summon nature's ally VII without needing to attempt a Use Magic Device check.
Fencing Grace					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:1,DEX=13			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Finesse,Weapon Focus (Rapier)										PRETEXT:Dex 13, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (rapier).

SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:When wielding a rapier one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon's damage. The rapier must be one appropriate for your size. In addition, if you have the panache class feature, you gain a +2 bonus to CMD against attempts to disarm you of your rapier while you have at least 1 panache point. You do not gain this benefit while fighting with two weapons or using flurry of blows, or any time another hand is otherwise occupied.																																																																				BONUS:WEAPONPROF=Rapier|DAMAGE|(max(STR,DEX)-STR)
Fighting Frenzy					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork		PRESTAT:1,CHA=13			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Rage													PRETEXT:Cha 13, rage class feature.															DESC:You feed off the rage of your allies.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:When you are in a rage and an ally with this feat within 60 feet is in a rage, you don't take the normal -2 penalty to AC for being in a rage. If you would take a larger penalty to AC for being in a rage, reduce that penalty by 2.
Know Weakness					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Knowledge											PRETEXT:Bardic knowledge class feature.														DESC:You are well versed in the susceptibilities of your foes.

Onslaught						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:1,STR=13			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Sneak Attack	PRETOTALAB:1	PRETEXT:Str 13, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1, sneak attack class feature.							DESC:No one is prepared for how hard you strike until they see it firsthand.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:If you use Power Attack with the first melee attack you make during a surprise round, you can sneak attack even if you are not flanking your target and it's not denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
Pack Tactics					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESTAT:1,INT=13			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Animal Companion											PRETEXT:Int 13, animal companion class feature.													DESC:You have trained your animal companion to fight using your tactics.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:Your animal companion is treated as having all the same teamwork feats that you do for the purpose of determining whether you or your allies receive a bonus from teamwork feats. Your animal companion doesn't receive any bonuses from these feats unless it actually possesses the teamwork feats. Your and all allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in a teamwork feat's description in order to receive the teamwork feat's listed bonus.
Totem Beast			DESCISPI:YES	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General			PRESTAT:1,WIS=13			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Animal Companion											PRETEXT:Wis 13, animal companion class feature.													DESC:Your animal companion becomes spiritually connected to an animal totem that has a spiritual significance for you or your background, such as a Shoanti clan's animal totem.						SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:Select one animal aspect from the list presented in the hunter class's animal focus class feature. Your animal companion has natural coloration suggestive of this aspect-a bear might have a dark spot in the shape of a bat, or a hawk might have unusual tiger striping in its feathers. Your animal companion gains the benefits of the selected animal aspect, treating its Hit Dice as its effective hunter level for this ability. This bonus doesn't stack if the animal companion is already under the benefit of the same animal aspect because of the actual class feature. For example, an animal companion with Totem Beast (snake) under the effect of the snake aspect from its hunter owner would get a +2 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity, not a +4 bonus.
Unfair Grip						CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat				PRESTAT:2,STR=13,DEX=13		PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Grapple,Improved Unarmed Strike,Power Attack				PRETOTALAB:1	PRETEXT:Str 13, Dex 13, Improved Grapple, Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1.			DESC:You learned to fight in places that have no rules of engagement, such as the back alleys of Absalom or the fighting pits of the Sodden Lands, and you can grab foes in ways that are difficult to escape.	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	BENEFIT:When you perform a grapple combat maneuver, you gain a +1 bonus on checks to maintain your grapple, and your grappled foes take a -1 penalty on checks to escape your grapple.
