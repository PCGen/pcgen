Carrion Compass				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Ranger,Witch=1|Sorcerer,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Divination												COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One undead creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes							SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.26	DESC:You animate one of the target's fetid organs so that it leads you to the undead creature's most recent controller or the cause of the creature's undeath. The organ floats in front of you at chest level and slowly leads you to the undead creature's most recent controller (if none, creator, or, failing that, place of creation) at a rate of 30 feet per round, always staying within your range of vision. If the creature was self­created, or if the it's most recent controller no longer exists, the spell fails. Once the organ is within 10 feet of its intended destination, the spell ends, and the organ falls to the ground. If the undead creature to which the organ belonged is destroyed, the spell ends and the organ falls to the ground.
Empower Holy Water			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Paladin=1|Alchemist,Bard=2									SCHOOL:Transmutation											COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One or more vials of holy water					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes							SAVEINFO:None (object)				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.26	DESC:You empower a vial of holy water to deal additional damage to undead creatures. You can empower %1 vials of holy water. When thrown at an undead creature, the affected vial of holy water deals %2 points of bonus damage on a direct hit, and half that amount of to creatures caught in the splash area. This additional damage is positive energy damage, and has no effect on living creatures.|1+(CASTERLEVEL>=8)+(CASTERLEVEL>=12)|min(10,CASTERLEVEL)
Force Anchor				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Summoner=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=3						SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation		DESCRIPTOR:Force			COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One anchor of force							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds								SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	DESC:You conjure an anchor of pure force that immediately skewers your target on a successful ranged touch attack. If it hits, the attack deals the target %1d4 points of damage and the anchor becomes firmly lodged in the target's torso. The anchor has no weight, but its wide flukes prevent the target from moving through any space smaller than the creature's size. The anchor also prevents incorporeal targets from moving through solid objects. Whenever the target moves through a square occupied by another creature, the square counts as 2 squares for the purpose of calculating movement, even if the square's occupant is the target's ally.|min(5,floor(CasterLevel/2))
Life Shield					TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=2|Cleric,Druid=3									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Healing								COMPS:S,DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until discharged														SOURCEPAGE:p.27	DESC:You surround yourself with a positive energy field that damages undead opponents. Each time an undead creature damages you with a melee attack, that creature takes an amount of positive energy damage equal to half the damage it dealt to you. This damage is calculated after applying your damage reduction, resistances, and other defenses. Once this spell has dealt %1 points of damage, it is discharged.|min(50,(CASTERLEVEL*5)
Necromantic Burden			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric=2|Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Necromancy												COMPS:V,S,M/DF	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One undead creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours								SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	DESC:You make an undead creature more difficult for necromancers and clerics to control via effects such as Command Undead or control undead. If the target fails its Will save, the target's effective number of Hit Dice is doubled for the purposes of determining whether it remains under the control of another creature. Regardless of the target's actual Hit Dice, its effective HD cannot exceed %1. If the targeted undead is under the control of another creature and this spell causes the target's effective Hit Dice to exceed the controller's maximum capability, the target creature is immediately freed from control. Any creature capable of controlling undead may attempt to control the target, provided the target's effective HD won't cause the would-be controller to exceed its HD limit. The target's former controller can attempt to regain control over the target by relinquishing command over other creatures until its HD limit is no longer exceeded (or the former controller can wait until the spell's duration expires to attempt this at the target's normal HD).|CASTERLEVEL*2
Possession Trap				TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5									SCHOOL:Necromancy												COMPS:V,S,F		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You										DURATION:24 hours or until activated (see text); (CASTERLEVEL) rounds											SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:You place a protective ward over your spirit that ensnares creatures attempting to possess you. Should a creature attempt to possess you (such as via magic jar or a similar effect) while you are under the effects of possession trap, that creature must first succeed at a Will save or its possession attempt is ruined and its spirit is shunted into this spell's focus gem. The trapped creature is contained within the focus gem for %1 rounds, acting as though it were trapped in a magic jar for the duration of this effect. This effect fails if you are not carrying the focus gem during the time of the possession attempt.|CASTERLEVEL
Sphere of Warding				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Inquisitor=4|Cleric,Witch=5									SCHOOL:Abjuration												COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius sphere emanating from point touched		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours								SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:You create a luminescent sphere of orbiting energy that harms incorporeal creatures and dispossesses them of any stolen bodies. An incorporeal creature must succeed at a Will save to enter a space overlapping with the sphere; failure means the creature cannot pass through the sphere, as though it were a wolf of force.  If the incorporeal creature succeeds, it may pass through the sphere at will, though if it ends its turn within the sphere, it takes a number of points of force damage equal to 1d6 + %1. If a creature possessing another creature's body (via either magic jar or a similar effect) enters a sphere of wording, that creature is immediately ejected from its host body, the host's spirit returns to its body if it's able, and the possession effect immediately ends. When ejected, the body enters the sphere, while the possessing creature takes the appropriate amount of force damage (no save) and is shunted to the exterior of the sphere.|min(10,CASTERLEVEL)
Undeath Inversion				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4								SCHOOL:Necromancy												COMPS:V,S,F/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One undead creature							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]; see text					SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text		SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	DESC:You alter an undead creature's energy affinity so that it takes damage from negative energy and gains healing from positive energy, as if it were a living creature. If the target was able to channel negative energy or produce negative energy effects (such as inflict spells), these abilities produce positive energy instead, healing living targets and harming the undead. The target cannot impose negative levels on other creatures for the duration of the spell. The target's creature type does not change, and it is still considered an undead creature. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full­round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
