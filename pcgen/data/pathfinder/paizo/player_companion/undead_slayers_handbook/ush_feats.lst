You can also bless a piece of equipment with up to two blessings at a time. Each blessing provides a different special ability drawn from the Bless Equipment list (and the Align Equipment list if you possess that feat). You must still have a high enough caster level to bless a piece of equipment with each of the selected blessings.
Lingering Smite			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Channel Energy		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Channel Smite		PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:ClericChannelEnergyLVL,5],[PREVARGTEQ:PaladinChannelLVL,5],[PREVARGTEQ:OracleChannelLVL,5]	PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:OracleChannelDieSize,6],[PREVARGTEQ:ClericChannelPositiveEnergyDieSize,6],[PREVARGTEQ:ClericChannelNegativeEnergyDieSize,6],[PREVARGTEQ:PaladinChannelDieSize,6],[PREVARGTEQ:ClassChannelPositiveEnergyDieSize,6],[PREVARGTEQ:ClassChannelNegativeEnergyDieSize,6]		PRETEXT:Channel Smite, channel energy 3d6.										DESC:You can channel your divine energy through a melee weapon to cause lingering damage to undead creatures.		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When you use Channel Smite, you can damage your target slowly over a longer duration, rather than inflicting the normal effects of Channel Smite. Instead of the normal effects of successfully hitting with Channel Smite, you may choose the following effect. Starting on your target's next turn, it takes 1d8 points of damage each round at the beginning of its turn. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice you use to roll your channel energy ability. Your target can attempt a Will save each round, as if energy, to negate the damage dealt to it by this feat on that round. If your initial attack misses, the use of channel energy is still expended with no effect. Multiple uses of Lingering Smite (including those from multiple sources) do not stack, and instead reset the duration of the effect.
Weapon Versatility		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PRETOTALAB:1		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Focus																																																																												PRETEXT:Weapon Focus, base attack bonus +1.										DESC:You can use your favored weapons in unconventional ways.										SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When wielding a weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you can shift your grip as a swift action so that your weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage instead of the damage type normally dealt by that weapon. You may switch back to the weapon's normal damage type or another damage type as a swift action. If your base attack bonus is +S or higher, using this feat is a free action instead.
