# New Alchemical Discoveries
# ==============================

Boneshard Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Boneshard Bomb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Alchemical Zombie			SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:The alchemist's bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the skeleton template. Skeletons that are created in this manner count as undead created by  animate dead for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control.
Ectoplasmic Bomb*			KEY:Discovery ~ Ectoplasmic Bomb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.AlchemistBombModifier																SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:The alchemist can infuse her bombs with a special unction that damages incorporeal creatures and reveals the presence of undead creatures hiding in the area. Incorporeal creatures struck by an ectoplasmic bomb take full damage from the bomb. In addition, squares in the affected area of the bomb begin to faintly glow in the spaces where undead creatures have traveled in the last minute, including undead benefiting from invisibility or other forms of obscurity (such as ethereal jaunt),  effectively creating a glowing trail. Any undead creatures in the affected area at the time of the explosion likewise glow faintly. This glowing effect lasts for 1 minute, and is otherwise identical to faerie fire.
Phantom Limb			KEY:Discovery ~ Phantom Limb					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery					PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,8										SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:The alchemist can manifest a ghostly, incorporeal arm that juts out from his torso. This phantom limb does not grant the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, and it cannot hold or grab anything (including incorporeal objects). The alchemist may use his phantom limb to make a touch attack against a foe as a standard action, scraping away at the very fibers of the victim's soul. This attack deals %1d4 points of damage (Fortitude half, DC %2). Creatures that are immune to incorporeal attacks are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction except DR/ epic. The alchemist may suppress or activate this ability as a free action, and can use his phantom limb for %3 rounds per day (these rounds need not be consecutive).|CASTERLEVEL|10+floor(CASTERLEVEL/2)+INT|3+INT
Psychokinetic Tincture		KEY:Discovery ~ Psychokinetic Tincture			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AlchemistClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery					PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,4										SOURCEPAGE:p.21		DESC:Once per day, the alchemist can concoct a foul-tasting tincture that harnesses the power of the spirit. By drinking this tincture as a standard action, the alchemist can invite the latent spirits in the area to surround him. The alchemist can channel %1 spirits. Each spirit channeled this way grants the alchemist a +1 deflection bonus to AC as the spirits whirl around his body. As a standard action, the alchemist can launch one of these spirits toward a target as a ranged touch attack. Launching a spirit this way reduces this discovery's deflection bonus to AC by 1. As a launched spirit passes through its target's body, it emits a terrible wail heard only in the target's mind, causing the target to become frightened for %1 rounds (Will negates, DC %3). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the wail cannot be affected by this discovery again for 24 hours. The spirits whirl around the alchemist's body for %4 minutes, or until the alchemist has launched all of the spirits.|floor(CASTERLEVEL/4)|CASTERLEVEL|10+floor(CASTERLEVEL/2)+INT|CASTERLEVEL*10

The exorcist must make a melee touch attack against the possessed creature; if successful, the roaming exorcist deals damage to the possessing creature as if it were targeted by the roaming exorcist's channel energy ability (regardless of the possessing creature's creature type), and the possession effect ceases as the possessing creature is ejected from the host body. A successful Will save (DC = %1) halves the damage taken, and the possessing creature resists being ejected from its host.|ClericChannelPositiveEnergyDC			SOURCEPAGE:p.18
