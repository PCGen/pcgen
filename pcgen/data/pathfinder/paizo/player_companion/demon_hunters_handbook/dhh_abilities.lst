In order to do so, the barbarian must confirm a critical hit against an opponent with a natural attack or unarmed strike. The barbarian deals damage as normal for a critical hit and the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + i/2 the barbarian's class level+ the barbarian's Strength modifier) or take id4 points of Constitution damage as one of its vital organs is ripped free from its body.

Feast of Blood	KEY:Rage Power ~ Feast of Blood	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rage Power.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	PREVARGTEQ:RagePowersPrereqLVL,14	DESC:While raging, the barbarian may feast on the organs of her foes and absorb their power. After successfully ripping out a creature's vital organ, the barbarian may eat the organ within 1 minute of extracting it as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once the organ is consumed, the barbarian recovers a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the organ's owner. In addition, the barbarian gains any energy immunities or resistances the victim had, though the effectiveness of these resistances is halved (for instance, a barbarian who eats the heart of a creature with resist cold 10 would gain resist cold 5; energy immunities are reduced to resist energy 20). This energy resistance lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the Hit Dice of the creature whose organ was consumed. A barbarian must have the bloody fist rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 14th level to select this rage power.	SOURCEPAGE:p.8

She must use this ability within a number of rounds after the creature's teleportation equal to i/2 her inquisitor level, after which the trail goes cold. A cold iron warden may use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels she has beyond 2nd.

At 5th level, any chaotic or evil creature that casts a conjuration (teleportation) spell or spell-like ability while in the mist must succeed at a concentration check or lose the spell.
