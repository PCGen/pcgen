# Spell Name		Type				Classes of caster					School			Sub-School		Descriptor		Components		Casting Time			Range			Target Area or Effect						Duration										Save Info					Spell Resistance		Source Page		Description
Blood Song			TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=4					SCHOOL:Evocation								COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:2 min			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched; see text			DURATION:1 day or until discharged [D]					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:This spell functions as imbue with spell ability, with the following exceptions: only bard spells of the conjuration (healing), enchantment, and transmutation schools can be transferred; the imbued spells last for 1 day; and the subject isn't beholden to any principles regarding the imbued spells' use. As part of the casting, the caster must shed some of his blood (or an equivalent humor). If the caster isn't susceptible to bleed damage, regardless of the reason, he can't cast blood song. For each spell that is imbued using blood song, the caster loses 5 hit points, which can't be regained by any means until the spell ends or is discharged.
Hallucinogenic Smoke	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Witch=4				SCHOOL:Conjuration				DESCRIPTOR:Poison	COMPS:S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*3) rounds or until discharged; see text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:Dark gray smoke seeps from your eyes, ears, and mouth for the spell's duration, though the smoke doesn't significantly hamper your vision. Upon casting the spell, you may immediately exhale the smoke in a 30-foot cone or do so in a later round as a standard action, ending the spell. Each living creature caught within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated for (CASTERLEVEL) rounds as it is wracked with waves of nausea and disorienting visions. If it succeeds at its Fortitude save, the creature is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds. If you don't expel the smoke by the end of the spell's duration, you suffer the spell's effects instead. If you cast augury during the duration of hallucinogenic smoke, treat your caster level as 5 higher when determining the chance for a meaningful reply. Additionally, you know whether a result of "nothing" resulted from a failed or successful augury.
Jungle Mind			TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=4|Druid,Oracle=5		SCHOOL:Divination		SUBSCHOOL:Scrying				COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 min			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes						SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)	SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:You merge your mind into the jungle's social hierarchy, mystically establishing yourself as a master of wild beasts and an apex predator. You attain knowledge about the general animal population in a radius of 1 mile as commune with nature, and you then select one type of animal (such as birds, cats, snakes, or fish). For the duration of the spell, you can sense the location, movement, and size of creatures of this type in the area, though you can't discern species or individual identity. In addition, you improve the starting attitude of animals of the chosen type by one step for the duration of the spell.
Lay of the Land		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Bard,Druid,Ranger,Witch=2	SCHOOL:Divination								COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 min			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:1 day									SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:In a flash of recognition, you learn about the geography of your surroundings within a radius of (max(1,floor(CASTERLEVEL/2))) miles. This instant familiarity grants you a +(min(5,CASTERLEVEL)) insight bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks and Survival checks to avoid getting lost so long as you remain in the affected area. Additionally, for the duration of the spell you can make Knowledge (geography) checks regarding the affected area as though you were trained in that skill.
Source Severance		TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Witch=6			SCHOOL:Abjuration								COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:5 ft.		TARGETAREA:5-ft-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes [D]					SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:See text		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:You create an invisible barrier that surrounds you and moves with you, inhibiting one category of magic. When you cast this spell, choose either arcane or divine magic. This spell functions like antimagic field, but it suppresses only spells of the chosen type and supernatural and spell-like class abilities from classes that grant spellcasting of the selected type. Magic items, other spell-like abilities, and other supernatural abilities are unaffected. While this spell is in effect, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC 20 + twice the spell level) to cast any spell, whether arcane or divine. If you fail at the check, you lose the spell as if you had cast it to no effect.
Tectonic Communion	TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=7					SCHOOL:Divination								COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:Instantaneous																		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:Tectonic communion functions as commune with nature with an even greater range. In outdoor or natural underground settings, the spell operates on a radius of (CASTERLEVEL*100) miles, extending even underground without penalty. You may glean an additional (floor((CASTERLEVEL-13)/2)) fact from the list presented in commune with nature. Communities, dungeons, and signs of civilization (such as roads, farms or other constructions and settlements) exist as dark and unknowable blots in your perception of the spell's area; you're aware of their location and existence, but can't discern any information regarding them.
