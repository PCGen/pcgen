###Block: Feat benefits
# Feat Name				Benefits
# Ability Name					Benefits
CATEGORY=FEAT|Drunken Brawler.MOD		BENEFIT:When you drink a tankard of ale or strong alcohol, you take a -2 penalty on Reflex saving throws, but gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level, and gain a +2 alchemical bonus on Fortitude and Will saving throws. These bonuses lasts an hour or until the temporary hit points gained by this effect are spent, whichever occurs first. The penalties last for a full hour.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Butterfly's Sting.MOD		BENEFIT:When you confirm a critical hit against a creature, you can choose to forgo the effect of the critical hit and grant a critical hit to the next ally who hits the creature with a melee attack before the start of your next turn. Your attack only deals normal damage, and the next ally automatically confirms the hit as a critical.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Divination Guide.MOD		BENEFIT:Whenever you cast augury or divination, you receive further guidance by your deity's agents. You gain a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws for 10 minutes per your caster level in the class you used to cast the augury or divination spell.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Bullseye Shot.MOD		BENEFIT:You can spend a move action to steady your shot. When you do, you gain a +4 bonus on the next ranged attack roll you make before the end of your turn.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Nimble Natural Summons.MOD	BENEFIT:Creatures you summon with summon nature's ally can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, and similar terrain) at their normal speeds without taking damage or suffering other impairment. Thorns, briars, and undergrowth areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect the summoned creatures.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Charge of the Righteous.MOD	BENEFIT:When you charge an undead creature or an evil outsider, you do not take the -2 penalty for charging.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Protector's Strike.MOD	BENEFIT:When you choose the target of your smite evil ability, you also choose one creature other than you within line of sight. While your smite is in effect, the additional creature you chose gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier against attacks made by the target of the smite. This bonus ends when the smite ends. You do not gain the deflection bonus to AC typical for the smite evil class feature.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Bestow Hope.MOD			BENEFIT:When you heal a creature by channeling positive energy, you also relieve its fear. If a creature you heal is shaken, that condition ends. If the creature is frightened, it becomes shaken instead. If the creature is panicked, it becomes frightened instead.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Glorious Heat.MOD		BENEFIT:When you cast a divine spell with the fire descriptor, choose a single ally within 30 feet that you can see. That ally heals half your level in hit points, and gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Spear Dancer.MOD		BENEFIT:Each time you hit a creature with a two-handed reach weapon that you have Weapon Focus in, the creature is dazzled for 1 round.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Stone Read.MOD			BENEFIT:While within a primarily underground or mountainous environment, you gain a +%1 bonus on Perception checks.|StoneReadBonus
CATEGORY=FEAT|Undermining Exploit.MOD	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 insight bonus on combat maneuvers against opponents that are located in rocky, difficult terrain.
