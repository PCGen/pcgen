Blade Tutor's Spirit						TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Magus=1|Antipaladin,Paladin,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation					COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:You summon an insubstantial spirit of force that resembles a cloudy vapor hovering around your fists or any melee weapons you wield. The spirit compensates for your defensive or reckless melee attacks, nudging your weapons in the proper direction. When you voluntarily use one or more actions or feats that apply penalties to attack rolls with your melee weapons (such as a charge, fighting defensively, or using the Power Attack feat), the spirit reduces the total penalty on affected attacks by %1. Only penalties incurred by voluntary use of feats or maneuvers are reduced by this spell.|max(0,floor(CASTERLEVEL/5)+1)

TARGETAREA:Visual figment of the caster									DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will Negates				SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:An illusory duplicate of you steps clumsily into an adjacent square, presenting a tempting target before winking out of existence. Any creature that threatens that square must succeed at a Will save or make an attack of opportunity against the image. The image's AC is %1, but as a figment, the image is unaffected by any attack.|10+floor(CASTERLEVEL/2)
Dimensional Blade							TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bloodrager,Paladin=4|Inquisitor,Magus=5|Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6	SCHOOL:Transmutation									COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round							SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:This spell turns one melee weapon into a two-dimensional object with length and height but no width. Attacks made with the weapon are melee touch attacks that ignore all armor. Force effects, such as mage armor and shield, still apply their AC against attacks made with a dimensional blade. Bludgeoning weapons used to make attacks with this spell deal half damage and are treated as slashing weapons. If the weapon leaves your hand before the end of the spell, the effect ends.
Fiery Runes								TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Alchemist,Bloodrager,Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2						SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Fire		COMPS:V,S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Melee weapon touched										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until discharged	SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes (see text)	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:You charge a weapon with a magic rune of fire. When the wielder of the weapon successfully strikes a foe in melee with the weapon, the wielder can discharge the rune as a swift action to deal %1d4+%1 points of fire damage to the target. This damage isn't multiplied on a critical hit. If the target has spell resistance, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance when the rune is discharged. If the rune is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled; otherwise, the rune deals damage normally.|1+(CASTERLEVEL>=5)+(CASTERLEVEL>=7)+(CASTERLEVEL>=9)+(CASTERLEVEL>=11)

TARGETAREA:Melee weapon of opaque force									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:You create a melee weapon sized appropriately for you from opaque force. You are considered proficient with this weapon, which acts in all ways as a masterwork weapon typical of its type. The instant weapon has hardness 20 and the same number of hit points as a typical weapon of its type. As a force effect, it can strike and damage incorporeal creatures. If the instant weapon leaves your hand at any time, the spell ends at the beginning of your next turn.
Reaper's Coterie							TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bloodrager=2|Cleric,Inquisitor,Witch=3						SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Evil		COMPS:V,S,DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Weapon touched											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:The target weapon becomes a reservoir of spiritual energy, fueling its destructive power by drawing in a tiny fragment of the essence of each creature it is used to defeat. When the targeted weapon is used to reduce a living creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it gains a +1 profane bonus on damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for each creature reduced to 0 hit points or fewer with that weapon, up to a maximum bonus of %1.|floor(CASTERLEVEL/2)

Umbral Weapon							TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Bard,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2						SCHOOL:Illusion						DESCRIPTOR:Cold, Shadow	COMPS:V,S,M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Melee weapon touched										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.31	DESC:A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially damaging foes even when the weapon misses. Once per round, when the weapon's wielder misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can reroll the attack. If the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted creature and deals 1d8+%1 points of cold damage. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages the target. If the creature successfully resists umbral weapon, the spell is dispelled. If not, the creature takes damage as normal.|min(10,floor(CASTERLEVEL/2))

While this spell is in effect, your natural attacks and unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of damage, and any creature hit by your natural or unarmed strike must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled for the duration of the spell. A creature entangled by this spell can spend a standard action to remove the vines but can be entangled again by further unarmed strikes.
