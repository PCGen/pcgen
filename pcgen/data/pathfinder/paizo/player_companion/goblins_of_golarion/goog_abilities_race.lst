Advantageous Distraction	KEY:Advantageous Distraction ~ Trait	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Advantageous Distraction ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]						DESC:Like most goblins, you're easily distracted. Unlike most goblins, though, you have a knack for being distracted at the right time, especially when it comes to avoiding pain. Once per day as a swift action, you can be momentarily distracted in combat,  ducking an axe swing to inspect a toadstool, or stooping behind a tree to lick some bark and accidentally avoiding an arrow, and so on. When you activate this ability, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your AC for 1 round.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Balloon Headed			KEY:Balloon Headed ~ Trait			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Balloon Headed ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]								DESC:Your head is particularly wide and large, even for a goblin. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks, and Perception is always a class skill for you. Any Escape Artist checks that requires you to squeeze your head through a tight space take a -8 penalty.																																				BONUS:SKILL|Perception|1|TYPE=Trait									CSKILL:Perception		SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Big Ears				KEY:Big Ears ~ Trait				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Big Ears ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]									DESC:Your massive ears are your pride and joy, and other goblins claim you can hear a flea scream as it falls off a goblin dog. While this might not quite be the case, you gain a +2 bonus on all Perception checks made to hear noises. Additionally, you can hear noises that normally only dogs or other animals can hear, like the sound of a dog whistle.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Bouncy				KEY:Bouncy ~ Trait				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bouncy ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]									DESC:Your bones, flesh, and skin are a bit more elastic than those of most goblins; when you fall, you tend to bounce a little better as a result. Whenever you take falling damage, the first 1d6 points of lethal damage suffered in the fall are automatically converted to nonlethal damage. You also gain a +2 trait bonus on all Reflex saves made to avoid unexpected falls.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Color Thief				KEY:Color Thief ~ Trait				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Color Thief ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]									DESC:Your skin is an odd tint that somehow absorbs background colors. Maybe because your mother drank a lot of potions when you were still inside her belly. Maybe because you've been blessed by the barghests. Maybe because you're just better than the other boring goblins. In any case, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Stealth checks, providing you wear only light armor or no armor.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Dog-Sniff-Hate			KEY:Dog-Sniff-Hate ~ Trait			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Dog-Sniff-Hate ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]								DESC:You gain the scent special quality (Bestiary 304) but only against canine creatures, like dogs or wolves, including monstrous hounds such as hell hounds, yeth hounds, and even werewolves. You gain a +2 trait bonus on attack rolls against dogs you can smell.																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Foul Belch				KEY:Foul Belch ~ Trait				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Foul Belch ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]				DEFINE:GoblinFoulBelchDC|0	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, you can force a particularly odious belch at a single opponent within 5 feet. The character affected must make a DC %1 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.|GoblinFoulBelchDC																																													BONUS:VAR|GoblinFoulBelchDC|10+HD/2+CON					SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Goblin Foolhardiness		KEY:Goblin Foolhardiness ~ Trait		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Goblin Foolhardiness ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]							DESC:You have a tendency toward gross overconfidence in combat. When facing an enemy that's larger than you are, if you have no allies in any adjacent squares, your posturing, bravado, and cussing grant you a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls with non-reach melee weapons.																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Pustular				KEY:Pustular ~ Trait				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Pustular ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]									DESC:Your face is covered with unpleasant pimples and outright boils that have a tendency to pop at inopportune moments. Although this makes you particularly ugly, you're also used to discomfort. Whenever you're subjected to an effect that causes the sickened condition, you may make two saving throws to avoid the effect (if a saving throw is allowed), taking the better of the two results as your actual saving throw.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Rude Songs				KEY:Rude Songs ~ Trait				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rude Songs ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]									DESC:Providing an opponent can hear and understand you, the lyrics of your songs are so personally insulting that you gain a +2 trait bonus on all Perform (song) checks. Perform is always a class skill for you.																																													BONUS:SKILL|Perform (Sing)|2|TYPE=Trait								CSKILL:Perform (Sing)	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Ugly Swine				KEY:Ugly Swine ~ Trait				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.RaceTrait.GoblinTrait	PREMULT:1,[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ugly Swine ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.RaceTrait]	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Adoptive Race ~ Goblin]									DESC:You are a repulsive little freak whose origins are unclear. Your head is small for a goblin and your mouth oddly narrow, allowing you to pass in urban environments as an unidentifiable mongrel, providing you keep a low profile. However, if examined closely, your goblin origins are revealed. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks, and Disguise is a class skill for you.
