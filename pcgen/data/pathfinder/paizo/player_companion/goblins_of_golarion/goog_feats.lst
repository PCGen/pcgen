Ankle Biter									CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat												PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin	PRESKILL:1,Escape Artist=1			DESC:You know how to take a mouthful out of anyone who tries to overpower you.											SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:If you are the target of a combat maneuver you can, as an immediate action, attempt to bite your opponent in addition to any attacks of opportunity or other consequences your opponent might incur from attacking you. This bonus natural attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity itself and deals base damage appropriate for a creature of your current size (usually 1d4 for Small creatures). If grappled or pinned, you can continue to make this additional bite attack each round as swift action on your turn. You gain a bonus on any attempt to break the grapple equal to the damage you dealt with your bite that round. Special: You cannot make this bite attack when you are the aggressor, including if you manage to reverse a grapple or make any other attack of opportunity.
Battle Singer								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Bardic Performance	PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin								DESC:Your battle songs can drive your fellow goblins to new heights of frenzy.											SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT: When using bardic performance to inspire courage in allies, you can choose to sing in Goblin. Allies who do not speak Goblin gain no benefits from this performance. Allied goblins who hear your battle songs become more energetic and brave, and thus add the bonus granted by your inspire courage ability to all saving throws as a morale bonus.
Burn! Burn! Burn!								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin	PRESKILL:1,Disable Device=1			DESC:You take the goblin love of arson and fireplay to a whole new level.												SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You deal an extra 1d4 points of fire damage when you attack with fire from a non-magical or alchemical source (such as with torches or alchemical fire) and gain a +4 competence bonus on Reflex saving throws made to avoid catching on fire or putting yourself out when on fire. Additional damage caused by this feat does not apply to magical attacks or to splash damage.
Dog Killer Horse Hunter	OUTPUTNAME:Dog Killer, Horse Hunter	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin	PRESKILL:1,Handle Animal=1			DESC:Embracing fear and hatred of your ancestral foes allows you to make particularly telling blows.								SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against dogs and horses (including dog-like and horse-like targets such a nightmares or worgs). Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits against these foes.
Lead from the Back							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat												PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin	PRESKILL:1,Intimidate=1				DESC:You allies depend far too much on your leadership and encouraging words for you to actually put yourself in harms' way.				SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:During any round in which you gain the benefit of cover or concealment against at least one opponent, and you are not threatened by any opponent, you can bark orders and encouragement to your allies as a standard action. Doing so grants all allies within 30 feet a +1 bonus on all weapon damage rolls for 1 round.
Letter Fury									CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Rage			PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin								DESC:You go wild when someone tries to steal the words from your head.													SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:If someone reads or writes in your presence (including casting spells like glyph of warding or symbol) you can, as an immediate action, choose to activate your rage class ability for 1 round. This round of rage does not count toward the total number of rounds which you can rage each day, but if you wish to continue your rage beyond that single round you must expend rounds from your daily rage allotment as normal. Once you use this feat you must wait at least 1 minute after you cease raging before you can use it again.
Roll With It								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat												PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin	PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=1				DESC:You know how to take a hit, even if your reaction sends you bouncing and flying out of battle while shrieking at the top of your lungs.	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:If you are struck by a melee weapon you can try to convert some or all of that damage into movement that sends you off in an uncontrolled bouncing roll. To do so, you must make an Acrobatics check (DC = 5 + the damage dealt from the attack) as an immediate action. If you succeed in this check, you take no damage from the actual attack but instead convert that damage into movement with each point equating to 1 foot of movement. For example, if you would have taken 6 points of damage, you would convert that into 6 feet of movement. You immediately move in a straight line in a direction of your choice this number of feet (rounded up to the nearest 5-foot-square), halting if you reach a distance equal to your actual speed. If this movement would make you strike an object or creature of your size or larger, the movement immediately ends, you take 1d4 points of damage, and fall prone in that square. This involuntary movement provokes attacks of opportunity normally if you move through threatened squares, but does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature that struck you in the first place. You are staggered for 1 round after you attempt to use this feat, whether or not you succeed.
Saddle Shrieker								CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat												PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin	PRESKILL:1,Ride=1					DESC:You sometimes get carried away when encouraging your mount to fight.												SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You can choose to take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to grant your mount a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with natural weapons. These effects affect you and your mount for 1 round. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, this penalty increases by +1 and the bonus to your mount's attack and damage increases by +1 to a maximum of +5. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll.
Combat Distraction							CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General											PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin	PRESKILL:2,Acrobatics=1,Escape Artist=1	DESC:Anyone who attacks you while you act like a lunatic exposes themselves to brutal counterattacks from your allies.					SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can choose to do something that seems to serve no useful purpose. Example actions could include laughing at another creature's misfortune, rooting in your pockets for a snack, bending over to pick up what looks like a weird bug, or trying to fly into the air by flapping your arms like a sea gull.Although you're acting like a lunatic, your unpredictable actions are distracting. Any creature other than a goblin within 5 feet of you takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and concentration checks for as long as you continue to be a distraction and remain in range. This penalty stacks with other goblins performing combat distractions, as long as you're both adjacent to the distracted target.
Vandal									CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Sneak Attack		PRERACE:1,Goblin,RACESUBTYPE=Goblin								DESC:Even other goblins admire your talent for mindless destruction.													SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You treat unattended objects as if they were vulnerable to your sneak attack, but you only deal half as much damage as you would against an actual creature. For instance, if you rolled 12 extra damage from the sneak attack you would deal an extra 6 damage to the object. This only applies when attacking unattended objects.
