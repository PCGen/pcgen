# Spell Name		Type				Classes of caster						School			Sub-School			Descriptor				Components		Casting Time			Range			Target Area or Effect														Duration											Save Info								Spell Resistance	Source Page		Description
Blood Rage			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard=2|Adept,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL/2) willing living creatures, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:The targets of this spell become angrier as they fight, the pain of their wounds fueling their strength. An affected creature gains a cumulative +2 morale bonus to Strength and a cumulative -1 penalty to AC for every 5 points of damage it takes (maximum +10 Strength, -5 AC) for the duration of the spell. These bonuses last until the spell expires or the target falls unconscious.
Enemy's Heart		TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Adept,Cleric=2					SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Death|Evil		COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 full-round action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Living creature touched												DURATION:Concentration/10 minutes per HD of the subject; see text		SAVEINFO:None							SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:You cut out an enemy's heart and consume it, absorbing that enemy's power as your own. As part of casting this spell, you perform a coup de grace with a slashing weapon on a helpless, living adjacent target. if the target dies, you must eat its heart (a full-round action) to gain the spell's benefits. If the target survives, the spell is not wasted and you can try again as long as you continue concentrating on the spell. When you consume the heart, you gain the benefits of a death knell spell, except you gain 1d8 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the target, and the bonus to Strength is a profane bonus.
Ghost Wolf			TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4				SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:0 ft.		TARGETAREA:One quasi-real dire wolf-like creature									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours (D) or (CASTERLEVEL) rounds; see text	SAVEINFO:None (see description)				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:This spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolf-like creature made of roiling black smoke. It functions as phantom steed, except noted above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with less than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the wolf's rider) must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours. The ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only (CASTERLEVEL) rounds thereafter.
Shield the Banner		TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Adept,Cleric=1					SCHOOL:Abjuration											COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Standard touched													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes							SAVEINFO:Will negates						SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:This spell is used to protect one of a tribe's most valuable possessions: its tribal banner. Any creature (other than a member of the tribe which the standard represents) attempting to directly attack or touch the standard must make a Will save. This spell functions as sanctuary, but only protects a standard or banner. In addition, the spell grants a +2 bonus to the standard's hardness, and +10 to the standard's hit points for the duration of the spell.

The target takes 3d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for rules on burning creatures). A succesful Fortitude save reduces this damage by half and prevents the target from catching on fire. Each round on your turn, a burning target can attempt a new save to extinguish the flames (DC equal to the DC of the spell); otherwise it takes another 1d6 fire damage.
