Golden Eagle Epaulets will let your choose any skill, even Diplomacy (again)

No text for the Feather Token (Returning Raven). It costs 800gp, but no official description of what it does. Should the text from http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2kfgl?Andoran-Feather-Token-returning-raven-text#2 be included here? Should it simply be omitted?

I've given some traits the AttackOption, SaveBonus, or Defensive types. Should Traits not get those types?

The Avoral here varies from the one in Bestiary 2. Here it is not an Agathion. The book is wrong on its Perception (it's +23, right in the skills, wrong in the stats as +22) and Will save (+6, not +9). It also has magic missile at will instead of 3/day, and its wings do 2d8+1 instead of 2d6+1 (possibly also a mistake in the book).

The Steel Falcon's Heroic Speech might be better served with a split in the core rulebook of a new InspireCourageBardicPerformanceLVL from BardicPerformanceLVL.

New conditional skills Escape Artist (Escape manacles or ropes) and Survival (Get along in the wild).

New DEFINEs: EnemyOfSlaversSteelFalconBonus, SailorAndSurvivalistSteelFalconBonus, InspireCourageBonus (don't really need the last one)
