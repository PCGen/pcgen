# Spell Name				Description
Detect Charm.MOD				DESC:As detect magic, except you immediately detect the strength and location of each charm, compulsion, and possession aura on all creatures in the area. You can attempt to identify the properties of each aura [see Spellcraft in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook]. In addition to noticing the targets of these effects, you can recognize when creatures in the area are using these effects on others by making a Sense Motive check as a standard action [DC (20+CASTERLEVEL)]. If you succeed, you may make a Spellcraft check to identify what magic it is using [even if the target is not in the area].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Liberating Command.MOD			DESC:If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make an Escape Artist check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a +(MIN((CASTERLEVEL*2),20)) competence bonus on this check. This spell has no effect if the target could not get free by using the Escape Artist skill [for example, if he were under the effects of a hold person spell or paralyzed by Strength damage].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Suppress Charms and Compulsions.MOD	DESC:As remove fear, except the targets gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against charm and compulsion effects, and charms and compulsions in effect on the targets are suppressed for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Flight of Eagles.MOD		DESC:You summon 1d4+1 giant eagles to serve as mounts for creatures you designate. The summoned birds do not fight independently, but they willingly carry their riders into battle as if trained for combat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
