Adaptable Training		KEY:Advanced Armor Training ~ Adaptable Training	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AdvancedArmorTrainingOption.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:The fighter can use his base attack bonus in place of his ranks in one skill of his choice from the following list: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (engineering), Profession (soldier), Ride, or Swim. The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total base attack bonus (including his base attack bonus gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill's usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.

Armor Specialization		KEY:Advanced Armor Training ~ Armor Specialization	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AdvancedArmorTrainingOption.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:The fighter selects one specific type of armor with which he is proficient, such as chain shirts or scale mail. While wearing the selected type of armor, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor's armor bonus, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light armor, +4 for medium armor, or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the armor bonus doesn't increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor's base armor bonus, including other advanced armor training options. A fighter can choose this option multiple times. Each time he chooses it, he applies its benefit to a different type of armor.

Armored Sacrifice			KEY:Advanced Armor Training ~ Armored Sacrifice		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AdvancedArmorTrainingOption.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:When damage would cause the fighter or an adjacent ally to be knocked unconscious or killed, the fighter can instead direct the damage to a suit of armor that he is wearing or a shield he is using as an immediate action. The original target takes no damage, but the armor or shield is treated as if it had only half its normal hardness. The fighter can use this option %1 times per day.|1+(FighterLVL>=11)+(FighterLVL>=19)
Armored Sprint			KEY:Advanced Armor Training ~ Armored Sprint		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AdvancedArmorTrainingOption.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:The fighter gains Run as a bonus feat. If the fighter is proficient with heavy armor, he treats heavy armor as if it were one category lighter for the purpose of determining how fast he can move while running in armor.

Master Armorer			KEY:Advanced Armor Training ~ Master Armorer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AdvancedArmorTrainingOption.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:The fighter can use his base attack bonus in place of his ranks in the Craft (armor) skill. The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. The fighter substitutes his total base attack bonus (including his base attack bonus gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill's usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Additionally the fighter is treated as having the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Master Craftsman feats, but only for the purpose of making magic armor. The fighter does not need to meet these feats' prerequisites.																																																BONUS:SKILL|Craft (armor)|BAB-skillinfo("RANK", "Craft (armor)")
Quick Donning			KEY:Advanced Armor Training ~ Quick Donning		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AdvancedArmorTrainingOption.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:The fighter can don armor in a hurry without reducing its effectiveness, and remove it quickly when it becomes a hindrance. When the fighter dons or removes his armor or dons it hastily, the amount of time needed to do so is reduced, (Light-Don/Remove 5 rnds, Hastily 1 rnd; Medium-Don/Remove 1 min, Hastily 5 rnds; Heavy-Don 2 min, Hastily 1 min, Remove 1d4 rnds). Other characters can still help the fighter don his armor as normal. Additionally, when wearing hastily donned armor, the fighter can attempt a Strength or Dexterity check as a full-round action to remove the penalties associated with wearing hastily donned armor (DC = 10 + his armor's unmodified armor bonus). If he succeeds at the check, he is treated as having properly donned his armor rather than having hastily donned it. The fighter can also remove his armor in the same amount of time that it takes him to don his armor hastily. He can even remove sections of armor to escape grapples and similar grasping hindrances. Whenever the fighter attempts a combat maneuver check, an Escape Artist check, or a Strength check to escape from an effect that reduces or restricts his ability to move or act, he can reduce the armor bonus of any armor that he is wearing by up to half his armor's base armor bonus. If he does so, he gains a bonus on his check equal to the amount by which he reduced his armor's armor bonus. Multiple uses of this ability cannot reduce the armor's armor bonus below half its base armor bonus, and the reduction to the armor's armor bonus lasts until the fighter recovers and dons the removed pieces of armor.
Steel Headbutt			KEY:Advanced Armor Training ~ Steel Headbutt		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AdvancedArmorTrainingOption.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:While wearing medium or heavy armor, a fighter can deliver a headbutt with his helm as part of a full attack action. This headbutt is in addition to his normal attacks, and is made using the fighter's base attack bonus – 5. A helmet headbutt deals 1d%1+%2 points of damage. Treat this attack as a weapon attack made using the same special material (if any) as the armor. The armor's enhancement bonus does not modify the headbutt attack, but the helm can be enchanted as a separate weapon.

Whether using his armor as leverage against a grappling foe or using its weight to help him stop a bull rush, a fighter can use his armor to protect him from the chosen combat maneuver. While wearing armor or wielding a shield, the fighter gains a bonus to his CMD against the chosen combat maneuver based on the type of armor worn. Mithral armor provides a bonus 1 lower than normal for armor of its type.

Combat Acrobatics			KEY:Light Armor Trick ~ Combat Acrobatics		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You have trained yourself to expose only armored sections of your body when performing flips and rolls, leaving you less distracted by concerns about being struck in combat. You are not considered flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling, and do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. Additionally, if you use Combat Expertise to increase your AC, the DC for you to use Acrobatics to move through a threatened square at full speed without provoking an attack of opportunity by 10 does not increase.
Reactive Mobility			KEY:Light Armor Trick ~ Reactive Mobility		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:Practice has honed your reactions so that you react quickly and instinctively to threats. You add your dodge bonus granted by Mobility to your AC against all attacks of opportunity that you provoke, not just against those that are caused when you move out of or within a threatened area.
Reflexive Mobility		KEY:Light Armor Trick ~ Reflexive Mobility	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You have learned to sacrifice an opportunity to wound an opponent in order to avoid being wounded yourself. When you provoke an attack of opportunity from an opponent, you can expend one of your own potential attacks of opportunity for that round to double the bonus to your AC that you gain from the Mobility feat against that attack. This benefit applies to all attacks of opportunity that you provoke with the same action. If you are unable to take any more attacks of opportunity this turn, you cannot use this ability.
Sliding Charge			KEY:Light Armor Trick ~ Sliding Charge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You can use your momentum to confound your opponents. Whenever you charge an opponent and attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that opponent as a melee attack, you can drop to the ground as a swift action in order to slide into your target. When doing so, you add your Dexterity bonus (up to your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus) to the combat maneuver check. Whether or not you succeed at the check, you are prone at the end of your charge.

Acrobatic Sit-Up			KEY:Medium Armor Trick ~ Acrobatic Sit-Up		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You have developed the ability to recover from a fall and attack an opponent in a single fluid movement. Whenever you are prone, you can make an attack against a single foe and stand from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity from that foe. Make a single melee attack against one target without the normal penalties for attacking while prone. If you hit your target, you can immediately stand from prone (normally a move action) without provoking an attack of opportunity from that target for doing so. Any other target that threatens you can still make an attack of opportunity against you. If your attack fails, you provoke attacks of opportunity from all threatening foes and cannot stand until your next turn.
Heavy Versatility			KEY:Medium Armor Trick ~ Heavy Versatility	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:You take advantage of all the defensive capabilities your armor can offer. You can treat medium armor as heavy armor for the purpose of which armor tricks you can perform in it.
Light Versatility			KEY:Medium Armor Trick ~ Light Versatility	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:You are so comfortable in your armor that it seems lighter than it is. You can treat medium armor as light armor for the purpose of what armor tricks you can perform in it.
Roll into the Blow		KEY:Medium Armor Trick ~ Roll into the Blow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:You keep your wits about you when attacked and can turn the situation to your advantage. Once per day when you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can lunge toward your attacker, throwing it off-balance. The attacker takes a –4 penalty on all melee attack rolls until the beginning of its next turn. You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter.
Versatile Armor			KEY:Medium Armor Trick ~ Versatile Armor		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:You can adjust how you present yourself and maneuver in your armor to maximize your speed and mobility or to maximize your defenses. While using your armor for speed, your movement is not affected by your armor and its armor check penalty and armor bonus to AC both decrease by 2. While using your armor for defense, your armor's check penalty increases by 3 and its armor bonus to AC increases by 1. Adjusting how you use your armor is a move action, and the adjustment remains until you change it, take off your armor, or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).

Blade among the Folds		KEY:Heavy Armor Trick ~ Blade among the Folds	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:You are adept at concealing small weapons in your armor. While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a light melee weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow, within your armor. In addition, a searcher doesn't gain the usual +4 bonus on Perception checks to find the hidden weapon as long as you are wearing your armor, even if the searcher frisks you. This trick functions even in heavy armor that uses magic or materials to be treated as medium armor.
Protected Limbs			KEY:Heavy Armor Trick ~ Protected Limbs		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Whenever you attempt a disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC against any attack of opportunity you provoke as a result of attempting the combat maneuver check, and to your CMD against any combat maneuver your foe attempts against you before the beginning of your next turn.
Shrug It Off			KEY:Heavy Armor Trick ~ Shrug It Off		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by a confirmed critical hit or sneak attack, you can direct the blow to the thickest section of your armor to lessen the damage dealt. This reduces the attack to dealing its minimum damage, though it remains a successful critical hit or sneak attack (the minimum damage calculated includes all additional dice for the critical hit or sneak attack, and any abilities that apply due to it being a critical hit or sneak attack function normally). You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter.
Steel-Plated Smasher		KEY:Heavy Armor Trick ~ Steel-Plated Smasher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:You gain a bonus equal to 1/4 of your armor's armor check penalty (not including any reduction to the armor check penalty from class features or feats) on Strength checks to break doors and objects with less hardness than your armor. When your base attack bonus reaches +8, this bonus increases to 1/2 your armor's armor check penalty. When your base attack bonus reaches +16, this bonus increases to equal your armor's full armor check penalty.
