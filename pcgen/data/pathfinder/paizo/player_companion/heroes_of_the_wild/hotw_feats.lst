Bounding Step				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Nimble Moves									PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:PreStatScore_DEX,15],[PREVARGTEQ:FeatDexRequirement,15]		PRETEXT:Dex 15, Nimble Moves.													DESC:You can leap through difficult terrain like a deer or elk.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] You gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks to keep your balance and Reflex saves to avoid falling. Additionally, select one terrain type from the ranger list of favored terrains. Within that terrain, the maximum number of feet of difficult terrain you can move through as if it were normal terrain increases by 10 feet. Special: If you have the favored terrain class feature, you do not select a terrain with this feat. Instead, this feat's increased movement through difficult terrain applies to all of your favored terrains.
Branch Pounce				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PRESKILL:2,Climb=3,Stealth=3																									PRETEXT:Climb 3 ranks, Stealth 3 ranks.											DESC:You are adept at climbing trees and using the higher ground to your advantage in battle.														SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:When charging a target by jumping down from above (such as when jumping out of a tree), you can soften your own fall with a melee attack. If the attack at the end of your charge hits, the attack deals damage as normal and also adds the appropriate amount of falling damage. This falling damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. You land in an unoccupied square of your choosing adjacent to the target, and you take falling damage as if you had fallen 10 fewer feet. You can attempt an Acrobatics check as normal to treat the fall as an additional 10 feet shorter for the purpose of determining the damage you take from the fall and treat the first 1d6 points of damage you take from the fall as nonlethal damage. If your attack misses, you land prone in a random square adjacent to the target and automatically take the full amount of falling damage.

DESC:You can use your shots to distract opponents.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.19	BENEFIT:When you hit a target using Target of Opportunity, the ally who triggered your ranged attack can attempt a Stealth check to hide from your target as an immediate action, even if your target is aware of your ally's presence.
