Evoke Ki						KEY:Kyuubi Visionary ~ Evoke Ki					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Monk Class Feature.KyuubiVisionaryClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.SpellLike													SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:[NOT IMPLEMENTED] At 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter a kyuubi visionary selects one 1st-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list from the enchantment, evocation, illusion, or transmutation schools. Spells with a material component with more than 1 gp cannot be selected. The kyuubi visionary can cast the selected spell as a spell-like ability twice per day. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the maximum spell level that he can select using this ability increases by 1. For example, the kyuubi visionary can select a 2nd-level or lower spell at 8th level, a 3rd-level or lower spell at 12th level, and so on. Once the kyuubi visionary has selected a spell-like ability, it cannot be changed.
Magical Fist					KEY:Kyuubi Visionary ~ Magical Fist					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Monk Class Feature.KyuubiVisionaryClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural												SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:A kyuubi visionary can attack with his martial arts and cast spell-like abilities at the same time. During a flurry of blows, a kyuubi visionary can cast a single spell-like ability he possesses from his racial traits, the Magical Tail feat, or his monk class levels with a casting time of 1 standard action or less in place of one of his melee attacks. The kyuubi visionary must choose the melee attack with the highest base attack bonus to cast the spell-like ability. If the spell-like ability requires an attack roll, it suffers a –2 penalty (as Two-Weapon Fighting). If he casts the spell defensively, he can decide to take a penalty on all attack rolls he made during the flurry of blows, up to his Wisdom bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on his concentration check. If the check fails, the spell-like ability is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. The kyuubi visionary may choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.
Mystic Recall					KEY:Kyuubi Visionary ~ Mystic Recall				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Monk Class Feature.KyuubiVisionaryClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural												SOURCEPAGE:p.19		DESC:A kyuubi visionary can fuel his mystic powers using his ki.

The kyuubi visionary regains his use of the chosen spell-like ability as if it had not been cast.
