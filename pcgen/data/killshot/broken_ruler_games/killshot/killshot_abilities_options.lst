#OPTION DESIGN
#There are certain design conditions and statements found in every option. Use the guidelines listed here to determine when they apply. If any of these conditions are not listed under an option, they are not applicable.
#Automatic/Dice/Defensive Option: Tells you if the option is an automatic, dice, or defensive option and provides all the necessary rules for using it. Any rules not provided in this condition refer back to the default rules provided in Chapter I: Rules.
#Base Option: This condition is listed for each of the five base options and is available to all characters.
#Critical: All dice options will list the benefits gained for rolling a critical hit. Options creating a pool do not have a Critical listing.
#Focus: Denotes the option can only be gained from a focus or is available without spending training points to a particular focus. You can always apply the focus dice gained from your focus on these options, regardless of the circumstances.
#Professional: Certain options are only available to those who have dedicated their training within a particular focus. To access these options, you must have a certain number of focus dice available in a particular focus.
#Range: The standard range for the option.
#Stunt Option: Certain options require such determination and awesome power, they count as a stunt. If you complete the option successfully, you gain a boost or suffer a blunder on a failed roll.
#Trained: If the option requires your character to spend training points, it will say so here. The exact number of training points required will be listed.
#Trigger: Defensive options provide details for the trigger created by this option.
#Untrained: Some base options can be used "untrained," meaning an application outside the normal boundaries. These applications inflict serious penalties, but are available for all characters to provide extra possibilities.
#Weapon: If the option can be gained from a weapon, it lists so here. Some weapon options can allow for additional training points to increase its potential.
#To do so, you must already have spent the training points to gain a
#trained, focus, or professional option. To increase a trained option, you have
#to spend either 2 training points or half the listed points for a trained option
#(whichever is higher, rounded up) to gain +1d8 whenever you use that option
#from now on. Focus and professional options require a number of training
#points equal to the amount required to learn the focus it originated from -1.
#You can also spend 3 training points to increase the option dice with a
#weapon option, but you can only apply these additional option dice with a
#mastered weapon.

# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type									Var. Min. Value			Cost		Source Page		Aspects									Benefits
Active			KEY:Active					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay.AutoGranted								SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Base, Dice							BENEFIT:Conflict rules this game. Whether you're exchanging gunfire, words or battling gravity for the right to climb a brick wall, you're in conflict. The Active option represents all usual actions attempted by every character, from making a simple physical attack to hearing the sound of approaching footsteps to solving a crossword puzzle. Anything involving an active roll against an opponent or difficulty dice can be attempted with this base option. However, the Active option is limited in what it can do and is no substitute for experience and training. You can use another appropriate option to gain an advantage over your opponents or the Director.	BENEFIT:&nl; Base Option: The Active option is a base option and available to everyone in Killshot.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: Make a matching Body, Sense, or Mind roll against a single opponent or difficulty dice. The Director may determine which type of roll is required to perform your attempted action.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: You gain +1d20 to your next roll from the bonus option using the same stat.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range: Any. Weapons may limit the range or any other reason determined by the Director.	BENEFIT:&nl; Untrained: You can attempt to use the Active option untrained, meaning your character attempts to use an altered version of the option (i.e. attacking two opponents instead of one, making opposing rolls instead of matching rolls). You take a half penalty to all base dice while using this option untrained. If you attempt to compound the roll with an additional alteration, all base dice default to a result of 1 per die. Adding more alterations automatically causes the roll(s) to fail.

Aim				KEY:Aim					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay			PREVARGTEQ:PoolTraining,2	COST:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Automatic, Focus, Trained (2 points) or Weapon	BENEFIT:Holding your ranged weapon firmly in hand, you take a deep breath and hold it there. Only when the moment is perfect will you exhale, pull the trigger and take the perfect shot. This extra time spent concentrating on your opponent allows for more than just a steady shot, it can become the deciding factor between a kill shot and a mark who lives to run another day.	BENEFIT:&nl; Automatic Option: When you declare the Aim option, you add +2d8 to your next ranged attack roll against a specific target. You can use multiple Aim options to build a reservoir of option dice until the attack roll is made against your chosen target. If the opponent dies before you can roll your attack or you have to make an opposed roll for any reason, all option dice are lost and you must start again.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: Snipers gain this option without spending training points.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range: Any distant opponent within your weapon's range. If the opponent is out of your weapon's range, you cannot apply this option.	BENEFIT:&nl; Trained: Unless you use a weapon granting this option, you must spend training points to access it.	BENEFIT:&nl; Weapon: If you use a weapon providing the Aim option, you do not require training points to access. If you have already spent training points on this option and use a weapon with the Aim option included, you gain +1d8 to your ranged attack roll.

Alert				KEY:Alert					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Automatic, Focus, Trained (2 points)		BENEFIT:&nl; A life of constantly on the edge instills a sixth sense for danger. Your mind and body cannot fully relax, the slightest snap or faintest whiff of deodorant in the breeze makes you grab your weapon. This option grants you the ability to react quickly to danger and not fall victim like all the others.	BENEFIT:&nl; Automatic Option: When you declare the Alert option on your Team's turn, you add +2d8 to all opposing Sense rolls until the end of the current series. This roll cannot tell you any information regarding the specifics of the danger, only that you and/or any Teammates are threatened.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: Hunters gain this option without spending training points.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  5 Move options	BENEFIT:&nl; Trained: You must have spent training points to gain this option. For an additional 4 training points you can sustain this option during your sleep. Using it this way doesn't grant any additional option dice but it does not expire at the end of the current series.	BENEFIT:&nl;You can also spend 3 additional training points to increase the range by 5 Move options.

Anticipate			KEY:Anticipate				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Defensive, Focus, Professional			BENEFIT:&nl; Defensive Option: You can only apply this option after spending at least 5 Search points on a particular opponent. This option must be declared on your Team's turn, allowing you to set a trigger.	BENEFIT:&nl; Trigger: When you set the trigger, choose an option known to the opponent. When your chosen opponent declares that option, you replace your opposed or defense roll with your Sense or Mind focus dice (your choice) without any half penalties. If the triggered option already targets Sense or Mind, you can apply both stats to your opposed or defense roll. If your opposed roll succeeds, the trigger goes off and you steal the Edge and apply your Hunter focus dice to the first roll made against the chosen opponent. For example, you can add your Hunter focus dice to an attack roll against the opponent. These dice cannot apply to any bonus options gained after this initial roll.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: Your opponent is shaken by your anticipation, forcing him to take a half penalty to the stat of your choice until the end of the series.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: This option is only available to Hunters.	BENEFIT:&nl; Professional: Only Hunters with at least +3d12 Hunter focus dice gain this option.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Sight. You must be able to see your opponent or be aware of his position when you declare this option and for the trigger to go off.

Bullshit			KEY:Bullshit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Focus							BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: When you see an opponent - be it the mark or any other poor sap - you can use this option to make an active Sense vs. Normal difficulty roll against the opponent. Every hit gained goes into your Bullshit pool for use through the current objective. Each point in the pool can be exchanged to grant yourself a bonus hit to any active Sense or Mind roll against the same opponent or negate any of their hits rolled against you. If you negate an opponent's hits to 0, the opponent's roll fails. If the opponent has already rolled 0 hits on a successful roll, you can still spend 1 Bullshit point to cause it to fail.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: This option is only available to Grifters.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Sight

Burst				KEY:Burst					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Weapon						BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: When you use a Burst option on a ranged attack roll, add the weapon's option dice from the chart below. This option costs 1 ammo slot. Otherwise, this option works identical to the Active option for attack rolls.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: Every bullet hits its mark and you don't waste a shot. Your weapon regains 1 ammo slot (though it cannot exceed its maximum number of ammo slots).	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Equal to your chosen firearm's range.	BENEFIT:&nl; Weapon: You must use a firearm with the Burst option.

Concentrate			KEY:Concentrate				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Focus							BENEFIT:&nl;Maintaining a lock on a target requires all levels of extreme training. You have an unusual combination of natural stillness and professional dedication. You can ignore many difficulties others would feel compelled to abandon so long as you maintain a hold on your target.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: Once you have settled into a designated location, such as lying down in long grass or seated in a windowsill, you make an active Mind vs. Normal difficulty roll. The Director may apply certain modifiers based on environment to the difficulty dice. Every hit you roll goes into your Concentration pool. Every Concentration point can be used to gain bonus hits from any active Mind roll used on your target or to negate any hits requiring you to make an opposed roll and thereby breaking your hold with the Aim option. If you use a Move option, you lose all remaining Concentration points.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: This option is only available to Snipers.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Personal

Deadly			KEY:Deadly	KEY:Deadly ~ Option	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Focus, Professional				BENEFIT:&nl;Your time in thievery and infiltration mixed with assassination has given you the skills necessary to kill an opponent without making a sound.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: You can only use this option when you have at least 1 Shadow point remaining in your pool. Make a melee Body attack roll against an adjacent opponent unaware of your position due to your use of the Shadow option and apply any remaining Shadow points as bonus hits to the attack. If your roll is successful, only those adjacent to the opponent will be aware of the attack or you can use remaining Shadow points at a rate of 1 per adjacent opponent to keep them unaware of your actions. If you use the Deadly option to attack an opponent, you do not lose any remaining Shadow points.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: Regardless of the outcome, the opponent is killed instantly and no adjacent opponents are aware of the attack.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: This option is only available to Burglars.	BENEFIT:&nl; Professional: Only Burglars with at least +3d12 Burglar focus dice gain this option.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Adjacent

Detour			KEY:Detour					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Defensive, Trained (2 points)				BENEFIT:&nl;Skill with a ranged weapon grants accuracy capable of more than just the killing shot. The Detour option provides an interesting alternative to merely hitting your opponent.	BENEFIT:&nl; Defensive Option: You must declare this option on your Team's turn against a specific opponent within range. Using this option sets a trigger.	BENEFIT:&nl; Trigger: When that opponent uses a Move option, you can make a ranged Body vs Mind roll against the opponent. Success blocks the opponent's path and forces the opponent to change course or stop dead in his tracks (your choice when you successfully make the shot). You steal the Edge from that opponent.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: The opponent is startled by the maneuver, taking a half penalty to all Mind focus dice until the start of the next series.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Any distant opponent within your weapon's range.	BENEFIT:&nl; Trained: You must have spent training points on this option.

Disable			KEY:Disable					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Focus, Professional				BENEFIT:&nl;When they're first starting out, Techs aren't used to some of the violence of other assassins and most oftheir skills are useful in the back of a van using a laptop with Internet access. As their career puts them closer and closer to danger, they learn how to become useful in the field. This professional option allows a Tech to render a piece of technology inoperable or disengage its ability to perform a particular function.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: Make an active Mind vs. Hard difficulty (or any predetermined difficulty) while in range of a particular piece of technology, gear, or weapon. If successful, the item cannot function until the start of the next series. For every hit gained by this roll, the item cannot function for an additional series.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: The item is completely unable to function and cannot be used against you or your Team in this objective.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: This option is only available to Techs.	BENEFIT:&nl; Professional: Only Techs with at least +3d12 Tech focus dice gain this option.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Adjacent

Drive				KEY:Drive					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Focus							BENEFIT:&nl;Anyone can drive a car in a high speed chase, but only professionals can predict when their pursuers will attempt a PIT maneuver or know when to race between two transport trucks before it's too late. For them, it's not just about what to do in the moment, but how to plan ahead and plot the next turn before even reaching the intersection.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: This option can only be rolled while operating a vehicle with your Driver focus dice. Make an active Sense vs. Normal difficulty roll. Certain modifiers can be added by the Director based on the current conditions of the road and the events in the current chase. Every hit rolled goes into your Drive pool and can be exchanged for bonus hits for any roll made using your Driver focus dice. You can also reduce any hits from a successful roll made against you so long as you continue to operate a vehicle using your Driver focus dice.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: This option is only available to Drivers.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Personal

Dual Strike			KEY:Dual Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Trained (5 points)				BENEFIT:&nl;Brandishing a weapon in each hand can be intimidating, but foolhardy in the wrong hands. To do this properly and effectively, one must be trained. The Dual Strike option allows you to make two simultaneous attacks either melee or ranged at either a single opponent or two adjacent opponents. When you use this option, you must declare which is your primary and secondary weapon. Your secondary weapon cannot be heavier than your primary and both must be one-handed weapons. Only mastered weapons can be used with this option.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: You make an attack roll using 2d20 base dice instead of the usual 1d20 when using this option. Each base dice represents its own result, one from the primary weapon and the other from your secondary, and shared with all remaining dice applied to your roll. For example, all focus dice rolled are the same between each weapon; only the base dice vary. Each base dice is used to determine its own success and damage and must be opposed individually; if you attack the same opponent with both base dice, the opponent gets to make two defense rolls. If at least one roll is higher than the opposed or defense roll, the entire option is considered successful.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: You can make an additional attack roll with the same weapon.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Based on the range of your weapons.	BENEFIT:&nl; Trained: You must have spent training points to gain this option. For an additional 2 training points, you can use this option in combination with any weapon option linked to your chosen mastered weapon, such as Burst or Full Auto.

Explosives			KEY:Explosives				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Focus							BENEFIT:&nl;In the wrong hands, any explosive device can detonate during construction, delivery, or never go off at all. Using an explosive charge in any capacity requires education, hours of practice, and respect for the device. This option allows you to construct and detonate any explosive device of your own design, such as a bomb or improvised incendiary device. Equipment such as grenades do not apply under this option unless you are utilizing a grenade as part of an improvised explosive.	BENEFIT:&nl;This option is broken into two parts: construction and detonation.	BENEFIT:&nl;Dice Option (Construction): Before making any dice rolls, you must explain the concept for an explosive device to the Director. Use the chart below to determine the difficulty of the construction process and make an active Mind roll against the additional difficulty beyond Normal given below to build your Explosives pool. Every point in your Explosives pool can be used to incorporate one element in your design, based on the list above. You can only roll once per day per device and can make additional rolls to add more points to your device. If you do not roll enough points in time to complete the device, you can still proceed with your existing Explosives points to construct the device. For example, if you build a bomb inside a delivery package triggered to explode when opened, you make an active Mind roll vs 1d20 + 2d10 (1d10 for a hidden explosive, 1d10 for the trigger). If you roll only 1 point initially, you will only be able to build the initial device within the first day and must wait until the following day to enhance it further. Any remaining points available from your Explosives pool can be used to create bonus hits when inflicting damage on the target. The maximum number of points you can accumulate is equal to twice the number of points required to build your explosive device.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: You've created the perfect bomb capable of precise and devastating destruction. You can choose to target only a single opponent adjacent to the bomb and avoid rolling the standard burst attack when the device detonates or you can change the damage to normal instead of lethal.	BENEFIT:&nl;Dice Option (Detonation): Once you have a manufactured device, it's time to put it to work. Make a Mind burst attack against all opponents within 1 Move option of the device when the explosive device detonates. All damage caused by the device is lethal and can target all opponents within 1 Move option of the device's position by default.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: The blast's intensity destroys a single modifier of your choice and prevents all opponents within the burst range from accessing that modifier.	BENEFIT:&nl; Focus: This option is only available to Bombers.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Personal (construction); Burst (detonation)

Free				KEY:Free					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Automatic, Base						BENEFIT:&nl;Some things are just far too easy to pull off, yet can lead to that crucial advantage in a scene. There are many possibilities we take for granted, placing them in the Free option. Communicating and sharing information with Teammates or opponents, setting unique conditions or preparations, pulling the hammer back on a sniper rifle, and many more fall within this option's realm.	BENEFIT:&nl; Automatic Option: Any task within this option cannot require a dice roll. Your Team can perform up to as many tasks as there are Teammates with this option. If a teammate tries to make a 4th task it costs them an option. You can also use a Free option to draw a weapon or grab hold of any item or gear on your person. For example, it only take a Free option to take a weapon from a holster and arm yourself with it or reach into a pocket and pull out a flashlight. If the item or gear is located inside a bag or container, you must use a Quick option.	BENEFIT:&nl; Base Option: The Free option is a base option and available to all everyone in Killshot.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Personal

Full Auto			KEY:Full Auto				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Weapon						BENEFIT:&nl;Desperate times call for desperate measures and that's where the Full Auto option comes into play. This option allows your character to unload a firearm's entire magazine with just one roll, though at a significant cost if not used properly.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: When you use the Full Auto option to attack using an appropriate firearm, you can target multiple opponents and add the weapon's burst option dice (see below) to your attack rolls. Using this weapon option requires you to spent at least half your weapon's total ammo slots. For example, you must have at least 3 ammo slots remaining on a machine gun to use the Full Auto option. Add the option dice listed on the chart below with your first ammo slot. For every additional ammo slot used in this option, you to gain +1d8 on the attack roll. You can target a single opponent with all the dice or multiple opponents with any combination of option dice you wish. Each additional opponent must be within 1 Move option of another or else you must spend +1 ammo slots to access an opponent no more than +1 Move option away in distance. Otherwise, this option works identical to the Active option for attack rolls. You must roll individual attacks against each opponent with all your option dice rolled simultaneously. After all your attacks are rolled, if your weapon is reduced to 0 ammo slots, it cannot be used again until reloaded (a Quick option).	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: Your aim is fierce and accurate, unleashing an onslaught of death and destruction causing your opponents to cower in fear. Choose another Team in the series; it loses 1 action.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Equal to your weapon's range.	BENEFIT:&nl; Weapon: You must use a weapon with the Full Auto option.

Guardian			KEY:Guardian				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Defensive, Trained (3 points)				BENEFIT:&nl;Loyal to the end and never leaving an ally behind, you gained the training to maintain a rigid defense to all those you fight beside. When a Teammate faces a deadly attack, you step in to do what you can to keep her alive.	BENEFIT:&nl; Defensive Option: As a defensive option, you must declare it on your Team's turn and choose a Teammate within range. Using this option sets a trigger.	BENEFIT:&nl; Trigger: When the chosen Teammate fails their own defense roll, the trigger goes off and you can replace the failed defense roll with your own. Your defense roll faces the same stat and modifiers as those placed on your Teammate. If your defense roll succeeds, you steal the Edge from the attacker. If your defense roll fails, you are instead affected by the attack, not your Teammate.	BENEFIT:&nl; Critical: Your Teammate can recover 2 points of normal damage or 1 point of lethal damage or gain a bonus hit on their next attack roll against the attacking opponent.	BENEFIT:&nl; Range:  Adjacent. If you use a mastered range weapon, you can use this option from a range no greater than the weapon's range, but if you fail your defense roll, the Teammate will still suffer damage from the attack.	BENEFIT:&nl; Trained: You must have spent training points to gain this option.

Hack				KEY:Hack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Option.OptionDisplay										SOURCEPAGE:p.	ASPECT:TYPE|Dice, Focus							BENEFIT:&nl;Whether you're trying to access sensitive information locked in a computer file or cause a device to malfunction, the Hack option allows a Tech to thwart its original design to accomplish what he needs. Rather than a specific attempt to complete an individual task, this option allows the Tech to make generic observations of their need and tweak the following rolls made in a series as needed.	BENEFIT:&nl; Dice Option: Make an active Mind vs. Normal difficulty roll and place each hit rolled into your Hack pool. Whenever you make a roll using your Tech focus dice, you can use Hack points to gain bonus hits needed to complete individual components of your task. You can also exchange Hack points to remove circumstance dice and/or modifiers rolled against your attempts so long as you can apply your Hack focus dice to the active roll.
