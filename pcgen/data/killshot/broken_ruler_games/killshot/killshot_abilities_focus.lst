# Focus - May have up to two, most have one.
#TRAINING IN MULTIPLE FOCUS
#Each focus provided below offers a certain number of training points to unlock its potential, but there's
#something to be said for dedicated training. When you take on an additional focus, it becomes harder to
#learn without sacrificing your original focus.
#For every additional focus beyond your first, you must spend +2 training points. Therefore, to gain
#a second focus, it'll cost you +2 training point; a third focus will cost +4 training points; and trying out a
#fourth will bring up the cost to +8 training points.

# DEFINES:

# ISSUES:
# 1 - COST:0 will not be taken unless the AbilityPool has a Value of 1 or greater
# 2 - COST does not take a Variable
# 3 - Negatives *ALWAYS* Stack

The Bomber		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.BomberFocus		VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Explosives						COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Bomber Focus Dice: You start with +1d12 whenever you build, plant, set-off, or perform any option involving bombs. You take a half penalty to these focus dice when using them under duress.	BENEFIT: Options: You gain the Explosives option.	BENEFIT: Bomb Master: You can create improvised explosives or adapt existing explosive devices easily by using the Explosives option in a Standard stunt. This feature allows you to create an explosive device using household items, ordinary tools, and other typically non-explosive combinations. The end result might not look like much, but can come in handy in a pinch. If the roll succeeds, you gain a boost (as per the normal stunt rules); the device can be set to ignite at a later time, triggered by specific events, or any other condition allowed by the Director. If the roll fails, the device does not explode at all.	BENEFIT: For 3 additional training points, you can excel in a particular type of explosive device. Choose one of the construction components for your Explosives option; you automatically succeed in building this component into any device you build without having to increase the difficulty dice. When you incorporate such components automatically, you cannot gain any hits towards any following dice rolls, including the bomb's detonation. You can continue to spend additional training points to incorporate additional components for 3 training points each.
The Burglar		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.BurglarFocus	VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Shadow						COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Burglar Focus Dice: You start with +1d12 whenever you attempt any dice option with a secondary goal of avoiding unwanted attention or observation from people or electronic devices. You take a half penalty to these focus dice if you attempt to use them against an opponent actively aware of your presence and/or attempts to engage in burglary.	BENEFIT: Options: You gain the Shadow option.	BENEFIT: Undetected: Knowledge of a particular location gives you an advantage; if you have at least 1 hour to study floor plans, schematics, or monitor a particular area, you can ignore a modifier of your choice for as long as you remain within that location. This ignored modifier cannot use more circumstance dice than your total Burglar focus dice.	BENEFIT: For an additional 3 training points, you can enhance the benefits of a particular modifier by +1d10 whenever you use that modifier in combination with your Burglar focus dice. Every time you spend these training points, you can choose a different modifier. No modifier can increase to more than double its original number of circumstance dice.
The Driver		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.DriverFocus		VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Drive						COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Driver Focus Dice: Choose a type of vehicle listed in the Gear chapter. So long as you're operating that vehicle, you start with +1d12 to all active and opposed rolls. As you gain additional focus dice in your career, you can add them to your chosen vehicle or towards another type of vehicle.	BENEFIT: Option: You gain the Drive option.	BENEFIT: Stunt Driving: Your dedication to your craft has made you an excellent stunt driver. Whenever you attempt a stunt while operating a vehicle with your Driver focus dice, you can perform a Standard stunt without the increased difficulty dice.	BENEFIT: For 2 training points, you can perform all stunts without any increased difficulty dice so long as you can apply your Driver focus dice to the roll.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Driver Additional	BENEFIT: You spent 2 training points - you can perform all stunts without any increased difficulty dice so long as you can apply your Driver focus dice to the roll.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Driver Additional
The Enforcer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.EnforcerFocus	VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Survival						COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Enforcer Focus Dice: You start with +1d12 to one of the following types of attacks: melee, ranged, or burst. As you complete jobs, you can boost your existing selection or spread these dice towards multiple attack types.	BENEFIT: Options: You gain the Survival option.	BENEFIT: Weapons Expert: At the start of an objective, choose one weapon. You can use unarmed attacks if you like. For the remainder of the objective, you gain a mastered skill for that weapon at +3d6 without spending any training points. You do not gain any special benefits associated with your mastered skill's total trained dice, such as unlocking traits. If you choose a weapon you've already mastered, you can add those trained dice together or instead apply option dice to your mastered skill. These dice only apply when you use your Enforcer focus dice.	BENEFIT: By spending an additional 3 training points, you can increase the dice type for this feature to the next type. For example, your trained dice would become option dice. If you already use option dice, you can instead use circumstance dice. All other rules and conditions for mastered skills still apply.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Enforcer Additional	BENEFIT:By spending an additional 3 training points, you can increase the dice type for this feature to the next type.

The Grifter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.GrifterFocus	VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Bullshit						COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Grifter Focus Dice: You start with +1d12 in any social situation where you're pretending to be someone other than yourself or attempting to blend into a crowd to avoid suspicion. You take a half penalty whenever you try to use your skills to escape after alerting a mark or attracting unwanted attention.	BENEFIT: Options: You gain the Bullshit option.	BENEFIT: Play the Part: Many jobs require a mixture of acting and conning, specifically to masquerade as one person for an entire objective (even the entire job, if need be). For this, Grifters have learned to do a little research and prepare in advance for these difficult times. At the start of an objective, you can exchange hits from your Bullshit pool to gain fake skills crucial to pulling off your con. For every point used, you gain +2d6 towards an existing skill you do not already have. You do not gain any special benefits associated with these skills, such as gaining contacts with the Reputation skill. If you fail a roll using one of these fake skills, you immediately lose access to all your fake skills. This feature can only be used once per objective. So long as you can apply your Grifter focus dice and remain "in character," you can draw from these fake skills.	BENEFIT: By spending 2 additional training points on this feature, you gain +1d6 for every Bullshit point spent to gain these fake skills.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Grifter Additional	BENEFIT: You spent 2 additional training points on this feature, you gain +1d6 for every Bullshit point spent to gain these fake skills.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Grifter Additional
The Hunter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.HunterFocus		VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Alert|Focus Granted Option ~ Search	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT: When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Hunter Focus Dice: You start with +1d12 when searching for clues and evidence left behind at a scene, including footprints, credit card purchases, and obtaining eyewitness accounts. Without standing in the actual location to observe these clues, you must take a half penalty to these dice. You	BENEFIT: are not limited to rolls directly involving the mark.	BENEFIT: Options: You gain the Alert and Search options.	BENEFIT: Bloodhound: Being a good Hunter means finding the clue that breaks it all open and makes the mark that much easier to find. Once per objective, you can use a piece of physical evidence - from a photograph to a newspaper clipping - and obtain more information from it than most others could ever hope to achieve. You gain +1d10 when using that piece during any active Sense or Mind rolls while tracking down your quarry with your Hunter focus dice. Basically, it becomes gear in your hands.	BENEFIT: For 3 additional training points, you can increase this bonus by another +1d10 or extend this feature to associates and family members of your mark or any other target you're trying to track down instead of just physical objects. Doing so costs you 1d10 per association to your target. For example, you can follow the mark's wife around town instead by sacrificing 1d10 through this feature.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Hunter Additional	BENEFIT: You spent an additional 3 training points, you can increase this bonus by another +1d10 or extend this feature to associates and family members of your mark or any other target you're trying to track down instead of just physical objects.

The Sniper		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.SniperFocus		VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Aim|Focus Granted Option ~ Concentrate	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT: When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Sniper Focus Dice: You start with +1d12 to any roll, including a ranged weapon attack, against a single opponent of your choice once you declare the Aim option. Once you have unlocked your Sniper focus dice, you can switch to another opponent (or target an object) without skipping a beat.	BENEFIT: Options: You gain the Aim and Concentrate options.	BENEFIT: Down the Scope: When you're aiming at an opponent, including a mark, and can apply your Sniper focus dice, you can substitute opposed Sense rolls for opposed Mind rolls. You can ignore the Free option required to reload a shot on any weapon with the Aim option, allowing you to fire continuously on your Team's turn until you miss.	BENEFIT: For 3 additional training points, you can sacrifice 2 hits on a successful attack roll when using your Sniper focus dice to cause either a half penalty to the opponent's defending stat (i.e. Body) or cause a blunder to the opponent's weapon. When you cause a blunder to the weapon, it is temporarily damaged until it can attended to by the opponent and removed with a boost or a trait capable of removing blunders.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Sniper Additional	BENEFIT: Spent 3 additional training points, you can sacrifice 2 hits on a successful attack roll when using your Sniper focus dice to cause either a half penalty to the opponent's defending stat (i.e. Body) or cause a blunder to the opponent's weapon.

The Tech		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Focus.FocusDisplay.TechFocus		VISIBLE:YES	ABILITY:Training Pool|AUTOMATIC|Focus Granted Option ~ Hack							COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT: When you choose this focus, you gain the following benefits.	BENEFIT: Tech Focus Dice: You start with +1d12 whenever you use technology to obtain information on a mark (or any other related target) or use technology to complete the current objective.	BENEFIT: Options: You gain the Hack option.	BENEFIT: Countermeasures: Techs have a knack for planning ahead and incorporating a failsafe into anything they do as a precaution. Once per objective, you can incorporate a countermeasure into any device or option you've performed with your Tech focus dice as a means of thwarting any attempt by anyone other than your Team without having to make any active rolls. This can only be done with a roll made against difficulty dice and you must have an equal or greater number of Tech focus dice than the number of circumstance dice applied to any difficulty roll. For example, if you hack into a secure government website, you can install a countermeasure in your coding to prevent anyone from knowing you were logged into the server.	BENEFIT: For 3 additional training points, you can gain +1d10 from any single gear of your choice when used for this feature.|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Tech Additional	BENEFIT: For 3 additional training points, you can gain +1d10 from any single gear of your choice when used for this feature.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Training Pool,Tech Additional
# COMMENT: Requires Stefan's new ASPECT code to display properly

# COMMENT: What are explosive choices?

# COMMENT: We have a Base Cost of 4, but you can take another 3 Points in the Burglar to modify a single aspect, this may be done multiple times, but may not increase a particular item beyond DOUBLE it's value.
# COMMENT: Implementation not completed - Would do a separate Ability to Bonus a Var that controls the value.
