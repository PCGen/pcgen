#COMPANIONMOD FILE
Take advantage of the new feat mastervar and condense the file space, move familiar items into ability where possible
Add new masterbonus - fly is erroneous, but Jon has not substitute.

#Familiars - 

# GAMEMODE FILES
Changed XP progressions to use Slow, Medium and Fast
Added VAR 'MaxRank' for CLASS SKILL Max Rank system. Set to 10 above normal, should be more than sufficient. Leaves a pontential for +8 more.


# ISSUES DISCOVERED:
Gaslight is supposed to be a modern system derivative. But nothing in the book points this out. So, when looking for races for the familiars, any customer is going to be confused.
I know I'd be annoyed not having any reference to the listed creatures.

Since no Familiars are listed in the book other than by name, and such, it does make things a bit difficult. Is the goal that we do not use any stats for the familiars? They are just an adjunct that grant a bonus?
I can redo the system so you select the bonus, and make it easier than making a separate familiar if that is the desired goal.

MSRD Defined Animals:

LIST of non-MSRD Animals: For what it's worth, this list looks exactly the same as the Pathfinder Bestiary familiar creature list.
I certainly hope we aren't mixing game systems, because that is not good. (Different skills, feats, how ranks and bonuses are granted, etc.)
	Armadillo
	Fox
	Goat
	Hedgehog
	Pig
	Platypus
	Raccoon
	Scorpion (Greensting)
	Skunk
	Squirrel
	Turtle
	Weasel

Knowledge (Psychic) & Knowledge (Technology) listed a second time separate from the Knowledge group.

No "Craft (Writing)" referenced as a class skill by the News Hound class. Page 123.
No "Profession (Journalism)" referenced as a class skill by the News Hound. (Profession is a standalone skill)
No "Knowledge (Local)" referenced by class Street Rat
No "Knowledge (religion)" referenced by class Paladin

Missing "Heroic Surge" from class Explorer

PERFORM has the exact same wording as Knowledge.
"The number of Knowledge categories is kept purposely..."
"The number of Perform categories is kept purposely..."





OS Updates required:
Max Rank needs to use PCVAR Max_Rank_Display if available, fall back to default if not present.


###Summon Vivilor	P.311
Vivilor
Vivilors are outsiders who come in response to the summon vivilor spell.
Vivilors generally have humanoid shapes, but spellcasters can summon
quadupedal or serpentine vivilors if they wish. In addition to their basic
statistics, a summoner chooses additional special qualities from Vivilor
Menu A or Vivilor Menu B (see below). A spellcaster can substitute two
choices on Vivilor Menu A for one choice on Vivilor Menu B, or one
choice on Vivilor Menu B for two choices on Vivilor Menu A.
Vivilors do not speak. However, a vivilor can understand the instructions
of its summoner and follows them to the letter.
Species Traits
All vivilors share the following traits:
Darkvision (Ex): A vivilor can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision
is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and the
vivilor can function with no light at all.
Bonus Feat: Vivilors gain the bonus feat Archaic Weapons Proficiency.
However, they generally prefer to use their natural weapons in combat.
