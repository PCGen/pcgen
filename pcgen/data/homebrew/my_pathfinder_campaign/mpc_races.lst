#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Race File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the races file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.

#####
#Xill is the name of the race. It must be the first field on each line, the remaining tags may be of any order.
#
#The STARTFEATS tag grants a number of free feats to the race at first level.
#
#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Race. (F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,
#C=Colossal). Size is used in determining to-hit, AC, and affects some skills).
#
#The MOVE tag determines the Type and Speed of the different movement types the race has.
#
#The FACE tag Describes how much space the creature takes up. For 3.0 rules this tag is used for the Face statistic. For 3.5
#rules this tag is used for the Space statistic. If only one number is used it is assumed to represent all sides.
#
#The REACH tag determines the reach of the Race.
#
#The VISION tag is used to grant the specified vision to the character.
#
#The PREALIGN tag is used, so it is required that you have a certain alignment to be able to select this race. There is a
#multitude of existing prerequiste tags in PCGen. If you are looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you
#can find them listed under the topic "PRExxx tags".
#
#The LANGAUTO tag is holding a list of languages that the character automatically gains.
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The MONCSKILL tag is used to grant the listed skills as monster class skills.
#
#The AUTO:WEAPONPROF tag is holding a list of weapons that are granted as free weapon proficiencies.
#
#The LEGS and HANDS tags set the number of respective limbs that a creature has. The number of legs is used to determine the
#carrying capacity of a creature, while the number of hands is used for purposes of Multiattack and Multidexterity.
#
#The NATURALATTACKS tag defines the non-equipment attacks a race may possess. It follows a pattern of Attack Name, Attack Types,
#Number of Attacks and Attack Damage.
#
#The SA tag is holding a text that will be displayed as Special Ability on the output sheet.

#
#The MONSTERCLASS tag determines the number of Monster Levels the race gets on start. The class must be TYPE:Monster and have a
#PRERACETYPE that matches the race.
#
#The RACETYPE tag defines the Type of creature the race is. This is important for matching up with Monster HD, and for references to
#race, such as the Rangers Favored Enemy.
#
#In the HITDICEADVANCEMENT tag the last number of this comma delimited list is the highest HD the creature can advance to,
#through HD advancement. All the numbers preceding the last number each indicate the highest number of HD the creature can have
#before its size increases by one category.
#
#The LEVELADJUSTMENT tag raises the Effective Character Level (ECL) of the creature by the number supplied.
#
#The CR tag sets the Challenge Rating of the creature. For CR's less than 1, fractions are used (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Note: CR's using
#fractions must start with a "1/". Expressions such as CR:3/4 or CR:0.5 will not work.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the race. This will be displayed in PCGen.
