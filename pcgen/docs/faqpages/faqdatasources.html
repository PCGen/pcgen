      What is the System Reference Document
(SRD)?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     It's basically a Open Gaming License subset of what's in the
PHB, DMG, MM, Epic Level Handbook and the Psionics Handbook, the
real difference being that what Wizards of the Coast has declared
as Product Identity (PI) or Closed Content. That means the deities
are not in there, some monsters, character names and places are
omitted, and spell names may have been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     See WotC's declaration what is not Open Content here:
     <a href="http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/v35/Legal.rtf">
      SRD Legal
Information
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     All non-SRD material (e.g. the splat books: Complete Warrior,
Defenders of the Faith, Sword and Fist, Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun,
etc. all TM of Wizards of the Coast) was handled by Code Monkey
Publishing (see the next item).

      Why is book XYZ not included in
PCGen?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     There are a few possible causes for this situation and the
explanation hold true for both datasets that have never been in
PCGen and some which have been in PCGen but were removed.
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      If the book is closed content, then we may not have permission
from the publisher, or may not have permission to include enough
data to allow the data to be useful to our users.
     </li>
     <li>
      If the book if partially or completely OGL content, then we
still require permission from the publisher because the publisher
name and book title are both trademarks. Under the OGL, we require
permission to use those to identify the source of the data. We
believe if we cannot identify the source of the data, then the
value to PCGen users is lost (how do you find the data?), so we
will not include a dataset for that source.
     </li>
     <li>
      It is possible that PCGen does not have the features to support
a sufficient amount of the data from a given source, and thus is
not included in our production release (or is included as an alpha
source)
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     For more information on what sources are available in PCGen and
explanations for those that are not, please refer to our Publisher
Permissions page with this documentation set.

      Where are Wizards of the Coast's books
and modules?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Those had been handled under a special license by the gang at
     <a href="http://www.codemonkeypublishing.com">
      Code Monkey
Publishing
     </a>
     (CMP). Sadly, late in 2006, WOTC declined to renew
CMP's licence, and so they are no longer available for
distribution.

      Where are the Star Wars/Call of
Cthulhu/Wheel of Time files?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though Wizards of the Coast produces those books, they
don't own exclusive rights to that material. We'll need to get
permission from both Wizards and the other copyright owner(s) of
said material before we can include them in PCGen. It is our
intention to acquire this permission, but we're being very careful
about how we proceed to maximize our chance of success. We'll keep
everyone informed when anything worthy of reporting occurs. :)

      How do I include sources from Game Mode
X in Game Mode Y that I currently use?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     It is possible to do this, but you need to understand that this
may cause errors due to incompatibility of the different Game
Modes..
    </p>
    <p>
     To include all of Game Mode X's sources in Game Mode Y.
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Go to the system/gamemode folder.
     </li>
     <li>
      Choose the Y game mode folder.
     </li>
     <li>
      Open miscinfo.lst.
     </li>
     <li>
      Find the ALLOWEDMODES tag.
     </li>
     <li>
      Append '|X' to this line.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Now, all of the sources associated with Game Mode X will show up
in Y. Remember you may experience problems while doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
     To include specific sources from game mode X in game mode Y.
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Go to the *.pcc of the game mode X source in question.
     </li>
     <li>
      Find the GAMEMODE tag.
     </li>
     <li>
      Open miscinfo.lst.
     </li>
     <li>
      Append '|Y' to this line.
     </li>
     <li>
      Repeat for every source wanted.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Now, all of these specific sources from game mode X will show up
in Y. Remember you may experience problems due to Game Mode
incompatibilities while doing this.
