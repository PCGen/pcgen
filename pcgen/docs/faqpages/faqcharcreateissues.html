      Why can't I make a (insert Prestige
Class Name here)?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well I know you are all keen to play the (insert Prestige Class
Name here), so here goes:
    </p>
    <p>
     Make sure you have chosen
     <strong>
      all
     </strong>
     the
prerequisites. Not just some of them. This may include needing
levels in a particular class, ranks in certain skills, a particular
feat, particular spells in your spell book and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can check how you are doing by clicking on the class (in the
Classes Tab) you want to get to, in the bottom left hand corner it
will show you the class and what pre-reqs you are missing (in
red)
    </p>
   </li>

    <p>
     <span class="underline">
      Why isn't my character proficient with
(insert Weapon Name here)?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Are you sure you've fulfilled
     <strong>
      all
     </strong>
     the
prerequisites for this weapon?
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have, on the summary tab, try clicking the 'Abilities'
button then the "Weapon Profs" and select the proficiency.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <span class="underline">
      Why can I not add bonus languages to my
character?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the rules a first level character can choose a
number of bonus languages equal to his intelligence bonus. A
character may not choose bonus languages after first level. As a
house rule
     <a href="../menupages/settings/character/characterhouserulesoption.html">
      PCGen's
preferences
     </a>
     can be set to allow one to choose bonus languages
after first level.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <span class="underline">
      Why can I not add all the spells I
should know at level (X)
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     PCGen will allow you to add lower level spells to higher level
slots (per the rules) but this will prevent you from fully
populating these slots with spells of the highest level which could
go in them. For example, if your character can cast three 0-level
spells and one 1st level spell per day it is possible to add four
0-level spells to your spell list because you are using the first
level slot to hold a 0-level spell. This will prevent you from
adding a first level spell to your list. An easy way to avoid this
situation is to add you highest level spells first and work your
way down.

      Why does the ex-monk not work
correctly?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well basically supporting ex-classes and removing levels is a
very difficult task.
    </p>
    <p>
     We at every release improve this functionality, but the whole
issue probably won't be cleanly resolved until we head down the
CDOM path (in the medium term future).
    </p>

   <li>
    <p>
     <span class="underline">
      Why are there no
Feat/Skill-description?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     This is done to prevent anyone from being able to use PCGen to
bypass purchasing books. Feats that come from sources that don't
have one-line descriptions have similar descriptions created for
them.
    </p>
    <p>
     For special abilities from classes, PCGen has the name of the
ability from the class level table in the source book although if
someone adds in #/day or some such that isn't in there, that's not
a big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you want more description than this, you'll have to make your
own version of the files, because this is the word of the PCGen
Team and it will go a long way to avoiding publishers breathing
down people's necks about this whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Needless to say we do
     <span class="underline">
      <strong>
       NOT
      </strong>
     </span>
     endorse or encourage people
to start swapping fully descriptive text files.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      It is important to note that publishers are our friends!
A vast majority have supported this, so we're going to play nice
and so should you.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you don't play nice we send the Ninja Monkeys after
you...........
