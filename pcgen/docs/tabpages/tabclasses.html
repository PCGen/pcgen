  <h1>
   Classes Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Class
   </strong>
   tab is where you add class levels to
your characters.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Main Tab: Classes" src="../images/tabs/classestab/tab_classes_00.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The left pane displays the full list of classes available from
the loaded data sets. Besides PC classes, this list also includes
all NPC and Creature classes. Clicking on the
   <strong>
    Qualified
   </strong>
   button will remove all classes that have
requirements that the current character does not meet. An example
of this would be a class with an alignment requirement, such as the
   <strong>
    Paladin
   </strong>
   which requires that the character be
"Lawful Good". Finally, you can use the
   <strong>
    Search
   </strong>
   field to find the class you are looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
   The right pane is where the character's classes appear as they
are added. All classes previously selected, from this tab or from
the
   <strong>
    Summary
   </strong>
   tab, will already be listed here. In
this case, if you continue and select another class, either the
same of a new class, the newly selected class will be added to the
list.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lower pane is the
   <strong>
    Class Info
   </strong>
   pane. When you
select a class in the left or right pane this pane will display the
basic information for the selected class.
  </p>
  <p>
   Selecting a class is a simple process. Find and click on the
desired class in the left pane and then click on the
   <strong>
    Add
Level(s) &gt;
   </strong>
   button. The class appears in the right pane,
at the bottom of the list, and you are done.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you wish to remove a class level you click on the
   <strong>
    &lt; Remove Level
   </strong>
   button. The last class added
will be removed from the character and from the right pane.
