   Templates Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   Templates are generally meant to handle "permanent" adjustments
and not situational ones. Examples of these are the
   <strong>
    Advanced Creature
   </strong>
   template from the RSRD and the
Pathfinder core rules.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Main Tab: Template" src="../images/tabs/templatestab/tab_template_00.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The left pane displays the full list of templates available from
the loaded data sets. Clicking on the
   <strong>
    Qualified
   </strong>
   button will remove all templates that have requirements that the
current character does not meet. An example of one of these would
be a race with an alignment requirement such as
   <strong>
    Trained
Animal
   </strong>
   which requires, per the Pathfinder Core Rules, that
the creature upon which it is applied must be an
   <strong>
    Animal
   </strong>
   with an intelligence of less than 3.
Finally, you can use the
   <strong>
    Search
   </strong>
   field to find the
template you are looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
   The right pane is where templates applied to the character
appear, whether newly applied or applied previously. once its been
selected.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lower pane is the
   <strong>
    Template Info
   </strong>
   pane. When
you select a template in the left or right pane this pane will
display the basic information for the selected template.
  </p>
  <p>
   Selecting a template is a simple process. Find and click on the
desired template in the left pane and then click on the
   <strong>
    Add
Template &gt;
   </strong>
   button. The template appears in the right
pane and you are done.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you wish to remove any applied templates, and assuming that
the template is removable, you simply select the template listed in
the right pane that is to be removed and click on the
   <strong>
    &lt;
Remove Template
   </strong>
   button. The template will be removed from
the character and from the right pane.
