   Creating Character Sheet Templates

  <h2>
   Preface
  </h2>
  <p>
   This guide is in the main going to focus on using the tokens
effectively and appropriately. For simplicity, we will primarily
use HTML examples, some of which may be fairly complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you need help with HTML or XML/XSL you should visit
   <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">
    http://www.w3c.org
   </a>
   and read their
tutorials. For information about FOP (.fo file processing), visit

  </p>
  <p>
   After going over the basics, I will be taking you through the
steps I used to create a sheet to display a character's weapons and
equipment.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
   You will need to have a basic understanding of how PCGen uses
character sheet templates to create them.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you "Export" a character, the program will ask you which
template you would like to use. PCGen starts by reading that
template into memory. PCGen scans for special character sets called
"tokens" as it reads the template. These tokens represent various
bits of information about the character you are exporting. When
PCGen encounters one of these tokens, it retrieves the information
from the character file and inserts the information into the spot
where the token was. PCGen writes the file out to disk with the
information in place of the tokens once it has completely loaded
the file.
  </p>
  <p>
   A sample line in an HTML template file might be:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;i&gt;Character Name:&lt;/i&gt;
|NAME|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   If you open the template with an HTML browser you would see:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <em>
    Character Name:
   </em>
   |NAME|
  </p>
  <p>
   When you open the output file after exporting a character named
"Mad Monkey Mynex" using that template you would see:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <em>
    Character Name:
   </em>
   Mad Monkey Mynex
  </p>
  <p>
   The bodies of the templates themselves can be done in HTML or
XML/XSL:FO for PDF. In either case, the tokens used to get
information from PCGen into the sheet are the same. A word of
warning: PCGen only changes the token, nothing else. If you put in
bad HTML or XML/XSL code, bad HTML or XML/XSL code will come
out.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first and most important thing I want to stress is to read
the documentation on the individual output tokens. Then read them
again. There are many subtleties in the use of the tokens contained
there that cannot be covered in a quick walkthrough.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through some frustrating trial and error when I began doing
character sheets for PCGen, I learned a few important things
regarding basic Character Sheet design:
  </p>
  <ol class="indent2">
   <li>
    Decide on a specific purpose/use for your template. There are
LOTS of tokens and there is no need to try and use them
all.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Figure out what's going to go on the sheet. Are you just going
to show the main AC? Are you going to want to show all the
modifiers that make up the total AC? Do you want spell lists?
Etc.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify most of your tokens beforehand. Once you have decided
what you want on the sheet, it's time to start figuring out what
tokens you need to use. It is easiest to sketch a simple layout on
a sheet of paper and fill in what tokens go where so you have a
quick reference. You don't have to get them all right now, but it
is very helpful to have them right there so you don't have to go
digging around through the documentation looking for the proper
token when you're actually trying to type in the sheet.
   </li>
   <li>
    Remember that tokens do not like whitespace in front of them!
It will make your sheets go wonky, without you knowing
why...
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
   Tokens
  </h2>
  <p>
   Now down to the true nuts and bolts, the tokens. First, some
general notes:
  </p>
  <ol class="indent2">
   <li>
    All tokens are CAPITALIZED. There may be variables or options
that are not, but the token itself will be.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    All tokens are delimited (set apart) from the rest of the text
on the character sheets by either the | (pipe) character, a \
(single backslash) or a \\ (double backslash), depending on where
the token is used. There are no spaces between the beginning and
end of the token and the delimiter characters. The token
documentation has the delimiter characters left out for ease of
reading
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Some tokens output a single item, some output comma delimited
lists.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Not all tokens make PCGen output something. Some are control
commands that make comparisons, cause loops or apply filters. We
will discuss these shortly.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Many tokens use variables so you can get at certain aspects.
Variables come immediately after the token with a period "."
between them. For example the token
    <code>EXPORT</code>
    can provide
date and time information on a sheet using
    <code>EXPORT.DATE</code>
    and
    <code>EXPORT.TIME</code>
    . The variables that may be used with
each token are listed in the output sheet token documentation. Not
all variables are capitalized. Some numeric variables start at zero
(0) but those should be noted in the documentation for the
token.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
   Control Tokens
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Filter Tokens
  </h3>
  <p>
   The first and easiest to understand of the control tokens are
the filter tokens. These are used to stop the normal output if the
filter condition is not met. Filters all begin with a % (percent)
sign and will run from the moment they are invoked until they
encounter a different filter or until they encounter the end of
filter token, which is a single % symbol (E.g.
   <code>|%|</code>
   ) In
case this wasn't clear, what it essentially means is that one, and
only one, filter may be active at any time. Nested filters are not
supported.
  </p>
  <p>
   The simplest ones are in the form
   <code>|%TOKEN|</code>
   . Here
PCGen simply checks to see if the character has the appropriate
data. A good use of these simple filters is to suppress spell list
blocks for non-spellcasters so you can use the same character sheet
for both types of characters and not have an empty spell list
cluttering things up for a non-spellcaster. Examples of these types
of tokens would be
   <code>|%SPELLISTBOOK|</code>
   or
   <code>|%BIO|</code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Some slightly more complex filters are in the form of
   <code>|%ARMORx|</code>
   and
   <code>|%WEAPONx|</code>
   . In these
filters x represents the number of appropriate items (armor type or
weapon type for the above examples) that the character must have in
order for the filter to allow output. For example:
   <code>|%WEAPON3|</code>
   means that there would be no output after
the filter until it reaches the next filter or filter end token
unless the character has at least three weapons. If the character
has three weapons the output would proceed as normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next form a filter may take is that of classname=level or
SPELLLISTCLASSx=level. For example,
   <code>|%BARD=3|</code>
   would
filter output if the character did not have at least three Bard
levels.
   <code>|%SPELLLISTCLASS0=2|</code>
   would filter output if
the character did not have at least two levels in his first
spellcasting class.
   <code>SPELLLISTCLASS</code>
   is one of the
tokens that starts at zero as mentioned earlier. These filters are
usually used to put class specific information on a sheet and keep
it from appearing unless you are of the appropriate class and
level. (Barbarian Rage is a good example here).
  </p>
  <p>
   The final form of filter is one that uses variables. They all
start with %VAR and take the form of
   <code>|%VAR.name.label.value|</code>
   . The "name" is the name of any
variable that has been set up in the LST files using the VAR tag.
The label is a comparator and must be one of the following:
  </p>
  <ul class="indent 1">
   <li>
    <code>EQ</code>
    (equals).
   </li>
   <li>
    <code>NEQ</code>
    (not equal).
   </li>
   <li>
    <code>LT</code>
    (less than).
   </li>
   <li>
    <code>LTEQ</code>
    (less than or equal to).
   </li>
   <li>
    <code>GT</code>
    (greater than).
   </li>
   <li>
    <code>GTEQ</code>
    (greater than or equal to).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   An example using the variable TOTALPOWERPOINTS defined in a LST
from the Psionic Handbook would be:
   <code>|%VAR.TOTALPOWERPOINTS.GTEQ.1|</code>
   . This would filter
output unless the variable TOTALPOWERPOINTS was greater than or
equal to 1.
  </p>
  <p>
   All of the available filters are listed in the output sheet
token documentation with the exception of the VAR ones which are
too numerous to include since every VAR in every LST can be used as
a filter.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Count Tokens
  </h3>
  <p>
   The second special token is the COUNT token. This token also
takes a variable, but in a slightly different form. The variable
for the COUNT token goes inside a set of [] (square brackets). This
token returns the number of items of the variable type given.
   <code>|COUNT[CLASSES]|</code>
   would return the number of classes a
character has. While this has some limited use as an actual output
token, these tags are more often used to set the lower or upper
limit in a FOR loop, which will be explained shortly.
  </p>
  <p>
   All of the available variables for the COUNT token are listed in
the output sheet token documentation.
  </p>
  <h3>
   IF Tokens
  </h3>
  <p>
   The next set tokens in our review of control tokens are the
IIF/OIF tokens. The simpler of the two is the OIF token. It is used
to evaluate an expression and return a value (text or number). This
token is in the form
   <code>|OIF(expr,true,false)|</code>
   . There are
only certain expressions that may be used, and they are listed in
the output sheet token documentation. The "true" and "false" parts
may be anything you want them to be.
   <code>|OIF(SPELLCASTER0=PREPARE,Yes,No)|</code>
   would return "Yes"
if the character's first spellcasting class had to prepare spells
and "No" if it didn't.
  </p>
  <p>
   The IIF token has a much broader range and does not return
output itself. The IIF statement takes the form of:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|IIF(expr)|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;true actions&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ELSE|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;false actions&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDIF|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The IIF token, like the OIF token, can only take the expressions
listed in the output sheet documentation as usable with IF tokens.
The power of this token is in the ability to perform a whole series
of actions based upon the evaluation of the expression. An example
of the IIF token could be:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|IIF(SKILL0.UNTRAINED)|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>*</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ELSE|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>x</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDIF|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   This bit would check to see if your first skill (SKILL0) is
usable untrained. If the skill is, it outputs an "*" otherwise it
outputs an "x".
  </p>
  <p class="new">
   *** Update - Additional functionality has been added
so that you may compare (exact match only) the result of
   <strong>
    any
   </strong>
   token to an expected result. AND and OR
functionality has also been added.
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>|IIF(SPELLLISTCLASS.%class:Psychic
Warrior.OR.SPELLLISTCLASS.%class:Psion)|</code>
   would trigger if
the class number represented by %class was either a Psychic Warrior
OR a Psion.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Loop Tokens
  </h3>
  <p>
   The last set of control tokens we need to cover are the FOR/DFOR
tokens. These tokens provide loop capabilities for creating lists
on character sheets. These lists can include equipment, classes,
skills, spells, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The FOR loops come in three forms. The format of the first
is:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|FOR,%var,min,max,step,exists|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;character sheet stuff&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDFOR|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   In this token, %var is a variable name that you assign when you
create a loop. It should not/cannot be the same as a variable
defined in a LST by the VAR tag.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whenever you use that variable within that loop, it will be
evaluated and return the current iteration number. The min and max
values are the start and end points for the loop. It is normal to
start the loops at zero because most of the arrays in PCGen are
zero indexed.
  </p>
  <p>
   You may also use a COUNT statement here, or any token that
returns a number. You may use the
   <code>COUNT[xxx]</code>
   token in
the max field to tell the loop when to stop, or any token that
normally returns a number. The step field is how much you want it
to increment the variable each time it goes through the loop (this
is usually 1).
  </p>
  <p>
   The exists field controls how the loop acts if it runs out of
data before the max value is reached. There are only three valid
values for the exists field: 0, 1 or 2. If the exists field is a 0,
the loop will continue processing until the max is reached. If it
is a 1, then the loop will stop processing the contents of the loop
and continue on through the sheet as if the loop had reached the
max. If exists is 2 and the character sheet is currently within a
filter, PCGen will not print anything else until the end of the
filter
   <code>|%|</code>
   is reached or another filter is begun.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <code>|ENDFOR|</code>
   token tells the program where the loop
ends and is required when you use a |FOR, loop.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is an example demonstrating a FOR loop:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|FOR,%eqp,0,COUNT[EQUIPMENT]-1,1,1|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|EQ%eqp.NAME|&lt;br&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDFOR|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   This loop will generate a list of the names of all of your
equipment, one item to a line using the EQx.Name token, where x is
the current count in the loop. (The &lt;br&gt; is an HTML line
break.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Example output for a typical starting fighter would be:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>Half-Plate
    <br/>
    Outfit (Explorer's)
    <br/>
    Shield (Large/Steel)
    <br/>
    Battleaxe</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The variable in the above loop is %eqp. The min is 0. The max is
   <code>COUNT[EQUIPMENT]-1</code>
   . I subtracted 1 because we are
going to cycle through the equipment list and the equipment list
array starts at 0 while the COUNT statement starts at 1. Because of
this we need to reduce the actual count by 1. The increment is
going to be 1 and the loop will exit immediately if it runs out of
items before the max is reached.
  </p>
  <p>
   Notice the use of the variable %eqp to define the equipment
number each time through. Using loop variables properly, you can
accomplish the creation of large lists with relatively little
effort. This is the main reason to use loops.
  </p>
  <p>
   One last thing to know about these kinds of loops is that they
may be nested. For example:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|FOR,%spbk,0,COUNT[SPELLBOOKS]-1,1,1|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|SPELLBOOKNAME%spbk|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|FOR,%lvl,0,9,1,1|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|SPELLLISTBOOK%spbk.%lvl|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDFOR|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDFOR|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   This would create a list of spells for each of your spellbooks
(by level).
  </p>
  <p>
   The spell list loop is said to be nested inside of the spell
book loop. This allows us to use two variables. If you need more
variables, you may nest more loops. Notice that each loop needs its
own
   <code>|ENDFOR|</code>
   statement.
  </p>
  <p>
   The format for the next kind of FOR loop looks like this:
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>|FOR.min,max,perLine,phrase,startLine,endLine,exists|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   This kind of FOR loop can be used to generate multi-column
lists. Notice that the character following the FOR is a period
instead of a comma. There is no variable name in this kind of loop;
to get the current increment of the FOR loop you would use the "%"
(percent) symbol.
  </p>
  <p>
   The min and max variables are the start and end points for the
loop. The perLine variable is how many phrases will be repeated
before the endLine is printed (e.g. 3 if you wanted a 3-column
list). The phrase is the code that is parsed for tokens.
  </p>
  <p>
   You must use "\" (backslash) characters instead of "|" (pipe)
characters to delimit tokens within a FOR loop phrase. The
startLine will be output at the beginning of the loop and after the
endLine. The endLine variable will be printed every perLine times
through the loop.
  </p>
  <p>
   This type of FOR loop does not require an |ENDFOR| tag. This
type of FOR loop cannot be nested,
   <strong>
    <em>
     except
    </em>
   </strong>
   when doing a party sheet. Nesting in this manner will be covered in
the section dealing with party sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    NOTE:
   </strong>
   If you are using this type of FOR loop to
create a party sheet (psheet*.*) you must use a "\\" double
backslash to delimit the tokens within the phrase. Party sheets
will be covered elsewhere, but it is important to be aware of
it.
  </p>
  <p>
   A real example (for a single character sheet):
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|FOR.0,COUNT[EQUIPMENT]-1,2,&lt;td&gt;\EQ%.NAME\&lt;/td&gt;,&lt;tr&gt;,&lt;/tr&gt;,1|</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;/table&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   HTML note: The &lt;table&gt; and &lt;/table&gt; are the HTML
table opening and closing commands &lt;tr&gt; and &lt;/tr&gt; open
and close a table row respectively and &lt;td&gt; and &lt;/td&gt;
open and close a single piece of data in the table.
  </p>
  <p>
   This would produce a table of two columns listing the names of
all your equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Example Output:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>Half-Plate
    <br/>
    Outfit (Explorer's)
    <br/>
    Shield (Large/Steel)
    <br/>
    Battleaxe</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no named variable in this loop. The min is 0. The max
is
   <code>COUNT[EQUIPMENT]-1</code>
   . The perLine is 2, so there will
be two phrases output before the endLine. The phrase is
   <code>&lt;td&gt;\EQ%.NAME\&lt;/td&gt;</code>
   . The startLine is
   <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>
   (to start the row) and the endLine is
   <code>&lt;/tr&gt;</code>
   (to end the row).
  </p>
  <p>
   The final type of for loop is the DFOR loop. While the format of
the loop itself is fairly complicated, what it does isn't. Instead
of creating a table of elements across and then down, it creates a
table of elements down and then across.
  </p>
  <p>
   To illustrate the difference between the different loops:
  </p>
  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <td class="center">
      <code>FOR,</code>
      Loop Output
     </td>
     <td class="center">
      <code>FOR.</code>
      Loop Output
     </td>
     <td class="center">
      <code>DFOR</code>
      Loop Output
     </td>
    </tr>
   </thead>

  <p>
   The format for the DFOR loop:
  </p>
  <p>
   <code>|DFOR.min,maxDown,stepNextLine,totalMax,stepInLine,phrase,startLine,endLine,exists|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Explanation coming shortly (as soon as I figure out the best way
to turn this into Human English :p)
  </p>
  <h3>
   Math
  </h3>
  <p>
   Simple mathematical operations are supported in the character
sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The operators +, -, *, /, @ and ^ may be used and you may set
the order of operations using ().
  </p>
  <p>
   You must use at least two operands. These operands can be valid
tokens (that return numbers), or they can both be hard-coded
numbers or a token and a number.
  </p>
  <p>
   @ and / are both used for division, but the first one returns
only the integer portion of the operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Do not use spaces between the operands and the operator. Doing
so will cause the math operation to fail.
  </p>
  <p>
   Math can also be performed on attack routines without any extra
effort. For example: Say you use the token
   <code>|WEAPON%.TOTALHIT|</code>
   and it returns "+6/+1". Were you to
use
   <code>|WEAPON%.TOTALHIT+2</code>
   |, the output would be
"+8/+3".
  </p>
  <p>
   There are several variables you may append to a math operation
(using a "." As a delimiter) that will change the format of the
output. These variables are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    INTVAL - Displays just the integer portion of the result
operation.
   </li>
   <li>
    NOZERO - Displays blank if the result is zero, otherwise
displays the result.
   </li>
   <li>
    SIGN - Prepends the appropriate sign (+ or -) to the
result.
   </li>
   <li>
    TRUNC - Displays the result to the first decimal place.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   These variables may be used in combination with each other. For
example:
   <br/>
   <code>|(VAR.Turn Level+STAT5.MOD).INTVAL.SIGN|</code>
   would add the
variable "Turn Level" and the Wisdom Modifier together, return only
the integer portion of that operation and prepend the appropriate
sign to it.

  <h2>
   Character Sheet Creation
  </h2>
  <p>
   Now on to the actual process of creating a character sheet. The
first thing to do is to decide what our sheet is for. As a not too
simple and not too difficult one I will go through creating a
complete equipment list with the weapons separated out of it. We'll
put the weapons on one side and the equipment on the other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now that we've decided what our sheet is for we need to decide
exactly what is going to be displayed on it.
  </p>
  <p>
   We should have some way of identifying the character the sheet
goes with, and the player playing the character. The class listing
and level could be helpful too. If you are anything like me, you
have multiple printed copies of your character floating around all
the time in the various stages of their development, so these last
couple bits of information can be invaluable.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the weapons we should display all of the standard attributes
you usually see on character sheets; Weapon name, to hit, damage,
hand, range, type, size, any special properties and critical hit
information.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the rest of the equipment we can get away with a lot less
information. We would want the equipment name (lets make it bold if
it's a magic item), the location it's carried or equipped at, its
weight, how many of it we have and any special properties it might
have.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tokens for the above list (in the order I listed them above)
are;
  </p>
  <p>
   For the identification we have:
   <code>NAME</code>
   ,
   <code>PLAYERNAME</code>
   ,
   <code>CLASSLIST</code>
   ,
   <code>TOTALLEVELS</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   For the weapons we have:
   <code>WEAPONx.NAME</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.TOTALHIT</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.DAMAGE</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.HAND</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.RANGE</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.TYPE</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.SIZE</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.SPROP</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.CRIT</code>
   ,
   <code>WEAPONx.MULT</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   For the equipment we have:
   <code>EQx.NAME.MAGIC~&lt;b&gt;~&lt;/b&gt;</code>
   ,
   <code>EQx.EQUIPPED</code>
   ,
   <code>EQx.WT</code>
   ,
   <code>EQx.QTY</code>
   ,
   <code>EQx.SPROP</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The "x" in all of the tokens above will actually be a variable
of some type (%weapon or %equipment perhaps). We'll cover that in
more depth shortly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next up is to decide on the actual layout. It is best to sketch
what you're looking to do as a quick reference, and then begin your
HTML and craft it to fit the visualization you sketched out.
  </p>
  <p>
   While you may use an HTML editor such a Frontpage to create
sheets, I personally prefer to use a simple text editor and do it
by hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Construction of character sheets for PCGen is done almost
entirely through the use of tables for both the .html and the .fo
files. Some of the tables are simple, some of them are deeply
nested tables within tables.
  </p>
  <p>
   We need to start the HTML sheet and set a few basic parameters
like a white background, and a title to be displayed in the title
bar of the browser when the final sheet is opened.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;head&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;title&gt;|NAME|'s Weapons and Equipment&lt;/title&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/head&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;body bgcolor="white"&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Our first table will hold the identification and appear at the
top of the sheet. The HTML for this would look as follows (
   <em>
    note
that for the sake of space here I have removed several bits of
formatting information regarding font's, etc. that you will see in
the actual sheet this is referring to
   </em>
   ):
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;!-- Start Character Info Table
--&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"
width="100%"&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="35%"&gt;|NAME|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="20%"&gt;|CLASSLIST|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="10%"&gt;|TOTALLEVELS|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="35%"&gt;|PLAYERNAME|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td&gt;CHARACTER NAME&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td&gt;CLASS&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td&gt;LEVEL&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td&gt;PLAYER&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/table&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>
   and
   <code>&lt;/tr&gt;</code>
   are the
opening and closing tags for a table row. The
   <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>
   and
   <code>&lt;/td&gt;</code>
   are the
opening and closing tags for each piece of table data (basically an
individual cell to think in spreadsheet terms).
  </p>
  <p>
   What we've done here is put our tokens in the top row, and then
in the row underneath put labels for the various tokens.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note the comments and indentation. These can be very helpful
when you are in a deeply nested table and need to keep track of
where you are.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next we get into the aforementioned nested tables. Since we want
to divide the rest of the sheet in half, with one half being for
the weapons and the other half for the rest of the equipment, we
start another table.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;!-- Start Main Sheet Table
--&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;table cellpadding="0" width="100%" cellspacing="5"
border="0"&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td valign="top" width="50%"&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   This opens the table we will use as the main container for the
rest of the tables on the sheet. We've created the table, started
the first row and told it that we want the first data field to take
up half of the available page width.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our next task is to put the weapons tables into this data area.
We'll start with a simple table to put a banner across half the
page with a label describing what information the tables following
it contain.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;!-- Start Weapon Tables --&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;table cellpadding="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0"
border="0"&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center"&gt;WEAPONS&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/table&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The next step is to start the actual weapons tables. The first
step in this process is to craft the loop to cycle through the
weapons. For the sake of simplicity, we'll use the most basic kind
of FOR loop that I described first.
  </p>
  <p>
   We'll call our variable %weap just so it's easy to remember what
we're using it for. Then, because the equipment arrays are 0
indexed, we want our start number to be 0. To get the max number we
will use
   <code>COUNT[EQTYPE.WEAPON]-1</code>
   (remember the loop
starts at 0 so we need to end it one step early, hence the -1 on
the end). We want it to step through the loop one at a time so we
set the step parameter to 1 and we want it to continue through to
the end of the loop, so we set the exists parameter to 0. What it
took and entire paragraph to write out boils down to the
following:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|FOR,%weap,0,COUNT[EQTYPE.WEAPON]-1,1,0|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Our weapons information will be contained in two tables, one
immediately following the other. We do this so that we can have
different numbers of columns in each table. While it is possible to
achieve this look with a single table, it is much more involved to
try and produce.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first table will have the weapons name, attack bonus, damage
and critical hit information. The HTML would look like this:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;table cellpadding="0" width="100%"
cellspacing="0" border="0"&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" height="15" rowspan="2"
width="40%"&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.NAME|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" width="20%" height="15"&gt;TOTAL ATTACK
BONUS&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" width="20%"
height="15"&gt;DAMAGE&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" width="20%"
height="15"&gt;CRITICAL&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td
align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.TOTALHIT|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td
align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.DAMAGE|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td
align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.CRIT|/x|WEAPON.%weap.MULT|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/table&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Immediately following this will be another table that contains
the rest of the weapon information (hand, range, type, size and
special properties). That portion of the weapon display would look
like this:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"
border="0" width="100%"&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" height="15"
width="15%"&gt;HAND&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" height="15"
width="15%"&gt;RANGE&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" width="15%"
height="15"&gt;TYPE&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" width="15%"
height="15"&gt;SIZE&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center" width="40%" height="15"SPECIAL
PROPERTIES&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center"&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.HAND|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center"&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.RANGE|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center"&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.TYPE|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center"&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.SIZE|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center"&gt;|WEAPON.%weap.SPROP|&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/table&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   We then need to end the weapons loop and jump to the other half
of the sheet to do our other equipment, so after the above tables
would be the following:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDFOR|
    <br/>
    &lt;!-- End Weapon Tables --&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td valign="top" width="50%"&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Once again, we need to start a new table to contain our next
group of data. As before, we'll put a title identifying the
information the section will contain, as well as headers.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;!-- Start Equipment Tables
--&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;table cellpadding="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0"
border="0"&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td align="center"&gt;Equipment&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="60%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ITEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="10%"
align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;EQUIPPED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="10%"
align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;QTY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="10%"
align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WT.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td width="10%" align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;GP
COST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   As we did for the weapons, we need to devise a loop to go
through all the equipment we have.
  </p>
  <p>
   We'll call our variable %eqp just so it's easy to remember what
we're using it for. Then, because the equipment arrays are 0
indexed, we want our start number to be 0. To get the max number we
will use
   <code>COUNT[EQ.NOT.Weapon]-1</code>
   (remember the loop
starts at 0 so we need to end it one step early, hence the -1 on
the end). We want it to step through the loop one at a time so we
set the step parameter to 1 and we want it to continue through to
the end of the loop, so we set the exists parameter to 0. What once
again took an entire paragraph to write out boils down to the
following:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|FOR,%eqp,0,COUNT[EQUIPMENT.Not.Weapon]-1,1,0|</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike the weapons, the equipment will all be in one table,
which is a continuation of the title and header we did above. We
just need to get the proper information to line up under the proper
header. The next section looks like this:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td
class="border"&gt;|EQ.NOT.Weapon.%eqp.NAME.MAGIC~&lt;b&gt;~&lt;/b&gt;|&lt;br/&gt;
|EQ.NOT.Weapon.%eqp.SPROP|&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td class="border"&gt;|EQ.NOT.Weapon.%eqp.EQUIPPED|&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td class="border"&gt;|EQ.NOT.Weapon.%eqp.QTY|&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td class="border"&gt;|EQ.NOT.Weapon.%eqp.WT|&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;td class="border"&gt;|EQ.NOT.Weapon.%eqp.COST|&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   We now need to end the equipment loop and close out the
equipment table.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>|ENDFOR|
    <br/>
    &lt;/table&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;!-- End Equipment Table --&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Since our sheet is done at this point, we also need to close the
master table and the html page. The last bits of our character
sheet should look like this:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <code>&lt;/td&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/table&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;!-- End Main Sheet Table --&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/body&gt;
    <br/>
    &lt;/html&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>
   That about covers it. More complex sheets are simply using more
tables, sometimes nesting three or four deep. If you need help,
