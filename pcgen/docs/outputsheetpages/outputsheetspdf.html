  <h1>
   Character Output Sheets: PDF Versions
  </h1>
  <h2>
   XSLT based PDF sheets
  </h2>
  <ul class="indent1">
   <li>
    XSLT sheets are xml XSL Transformations based, more dynamic
versions of the .fo pdf sheets and have for the most part replaced
them by now.
   </li>
   <li>
    They are dynamic in the way that if the character has a
portrait it will be displayed. If there is no picture of the
character, that section of the sheet is simply skipped.
   </li>
   <li>
    If a character is of an spellcasting class, its spells and
spellbook will be listed.
   </li>
   <li>
    If the character is of an spellcasting class and has not yet
received any spells, no spell progression page will be added
(unlike the now deprecated .fo sheets).
   </li>
   <li>
    The sheet will include a bio page if there is some text
contained in the bio field. Feat descriptions are included as in
csheet_fantasy_descriptions.fo.
   </li>
   <li>
    The xslt intelligence is contained in the
    <a href="outputsheetbasexml.html">
     base.xml
    </a>
    file in the outputsheets
root folder.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    csheet_fantasy_std_xxx.xslt
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This sheet comes in several different colors, determined by the
xxx description and produces a 3+ page sheet styled after the
csheet_fantasy_std.htm sheet.
   <br/>
   It will display all possible variations of wielding each
weapon.
  </p>
  <ul class="indent1">
   <li>
    1 - Primary hand
   </li>
   <li>
    2 - Off hand
   </li>
   <li>
    3 - Two handed
   </li>
   <li>
    4 - Two Weapon Fighting Primary Hand (off hand weapon
light)
   </li>
   <li>
    5 - Two Weapon Fighting Primary Hand (off hand weapon
heavy)
   </li>
   <li>
    6 - Two Weapon Fighting Off hand
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    csheet_fantasy_simple_xxx.xslt
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This sheet also comes in several different colors, determined by
the xxx description.
   <br/>
   It is the same as the std sheet apart from the fact that for melee
weapons the simple sheet only shows the primary hand attack.
   <br/>
   The simple sheet is used for characters who only fight with a
single weapon in their on-hand and do not need the other 5
variations.
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    csheet_modern_std.xslt
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Same as the fantasy sheet, only for the d20 Modern gamemode
(Modern).
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">
   <strong>
    csheet_fantasy_spellbook_xxx.xsl
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   These templates are used to export the spells the character
knows or has access to, to a nicely formatted spell list. The
different templates offer several different layouts.
  </p>

   <strong>
    csheet_fantasy_Spellbook.fo
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent0">

listing all spells (regardless of class or level) in alphabetical
order with their details.
