  <h1>
   Character Output Sheets
  </h1>
  <p>
   The most important aspect of any character generator is the
final output, without that the program would be pretty useless.
  </p>
  <p>
   So in the next few sections the character sheets provided with
PCGen are explained. There are several basic types of output
sheets; Character Sheets, Equipment Set Sheets, Party Sheets and
Spell Sheets.
   <br/>
   Each may have different types of output; HTML, XML, PDF and
TXT.
  </p>
  <p>
   HTML and XML sheets are exported via the File - Export -
Standard function.
   <br/>
   PDF files are generated by one of two methods, XSL Transformations
(XSLT - .xslt), or XSL Formatting Objects.(.fo).
   <br/>
   XSLT is currently the prevalent solution and has more or less
replaced .fo sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most likely you would like to export to a
   <b>
    Character
Sheet
   </b>
   , it is a character generator after all!
   <br/>
   These come in several formats; HTML, PDF, Plain Text, and XML
sheets for

    Equipment Set sheets
   </b>
   are used to allow players to export
different equipment configurations, or 'dress' depending on the
environment they are in. The can be set up for the classic dungeon
crawl, meeting the prince, or their 'in town' for example.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Party Sheets
   </b>
   are primarily for use by the Game Master,
they contain condensed information on the entire party for quick
reference.
   <br/>
   See the
   <a href="../menupages/file/filepartyoptions.html">
    Party
menu option
   </a>
   for more information on Party (PCP) files.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Spell Sheets
   </b>
   are used to export the spells the character
knows or has access to, to a nicely formatted spell list. Several
layout options are available.
