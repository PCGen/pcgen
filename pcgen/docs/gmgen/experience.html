   Experience Tab
  </h1>
  <p>
   The Experience Tab enables you to calculate experience and award
it to characters after combat.

  </p>
  <p>
   The Experience Tab provides several options for calculating and
awarding experience points. Perhaps the simplest method is to enter
an amount of EP in the "Experience to Add:" field on the top right
side of the tab, select one or more characters in the characters
window on the top left side of the tab and click the "Add
Experience to Character" button. This will add the specified amount
of EP to the characters in PCGen as well as add an asterisk beside
the characters name in the Characters Tab indicating that there
have are unsaved changes.
  </p>
  <p>
   A more involved method works in conjunction with the Initiative
Tab. When combatants designated as Enemies are killed they will
appear in the Enemies window on the lower left side of the Tab. The
creatures Challenge Rating is displayed in parentheses next to
their name. "Experience From Combat" to the right of the Enemies
window displays the total amount of experience points generated
from all the combatants in the Enemies window. The slider just
below the total allows you to increase or decrease the total in
relation to how difficult of easy the encounter may have been for
the party. You may change the CR ratings of Enemies by selecting
any number of them and clicking the "Adjust CR/Level" button. only
whole numbers may be entered. You may remove Enemies from the list
by selecting any number of them and clicking the "Remove Enemy"
button. You may add additional enemies to the list by clicking the
"Add Enemy" button.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Add Enemy to Encounter" src="../images/gmgen/plugins/experience/gmgen_05_addenemy.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Set the Challenge rating for the Enemy, the number you wish to
add to the list, the name of the enemy and click Save. When you
have added your enemies to the list the "Experience From Combat"
will be updated to reflect the changes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once you are satisfied with the Enemies list you can award the
experience to the party by clicking the "Add Experience to Party"
button. This will divide the total experience by the number of
characters in the character window and add an equal amount to
each.
