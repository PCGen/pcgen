  <h1>
   Welcome to PCGen!
  </h1>
  <p>
   PCGen is a
   <strong>
    FREE
   </strong>
   Open Source RPG character
generator and maintenance program (d20 Systems mainly) that works
on most personal computers (it's Java-based so: Windows, Mac OS X,
Linux, Unix are supported). All datafiles are ASCII so they can be
modified by users. All of this work is performed under the watchful
gaze of the PCGen
   <a href="http://wiki.pcgen.org/index.php?title=Board_of_Directors">
    Board Of
Directors
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <h1>
   Mission Statement
  </h1>
  <p>
   To be the world's most flexible d20 character generation and
maintenance software.
  </p>

   About PCGen
  </h1>
  <p>
   The name implies that PCGen is just for generating PCs - which
it does - but the fact that it lets you do that with just about any
book published so far makes it useful for creating NPCs as well! We
also have plugins built for PCGen such as the GMGen series, which
help GMs run the game from their PC/Laptop.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our goal is to support all RPG material produced and to make it
easy for users to enter their own material. We also recognize that
just about everyone has house rules and we've added support for
many of these variations. For example, some GMs let their players
purchase ranks in exclusive skills, but at a higher cost than
cross-class skills. PCGen lets you set the cost for exclusive
skills to accommodate this. We support a good number of options
like this.
  </p>
  <p>
   The goal to support every RPG book is very ambitious, and
considering the amount of material out there you'd think we need an
army to make it happen! The good news is that we do have an army of
Monkeys - our general hang out area is our Yahoo Message board
located at
   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/">
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen
   </a>
   where we meet to discuss who is tackling what sources, what
functionality needs to be done before a source is completely
supportable, answer questions (newbie questions are welcomed!),
discuss potential bugs and refine new functionality requests. We
strive hard to make PCGen useful to gamers and have it do as much
of the dirty work involved in creating a character as possible,
while at the same time balancing that with the publisher's need for
sales. Put simply, we want PCGen to be useful to gamers and at the
same time not put anyone out of business. Obviously if we were to
endanger any publisher's source of revenue they wouldn't be very
happy with us. Fortunately we've found a good balance and the
publishers are very satisfied.
  </p>
  <p>
   How do we manage this? Basically we include in PCGen's data
files only enough information to create a character but we curtail
the descriptions to be just summaries. This means that you can see
that there's a class called Kickyourbutt, and if you advance to 4th
level in it you'll see that your base attack bonus is +12 and you
can use a special ability called "Kick Anyone's Butt (x4)". What
you won't see is a description of the class and any rituals
involved in becoming a member of this class, or how that special
ability works - if you want to know the details you'll need the
book. Effectively this means that PCGen is meant for all the
"crunchy bits" in a book, and all the flavor text remains in the
book. If you have the book, Kick Anyone's Butt (x4) is enough for
you to know what you can do - and if you don't have that book,
seeing that as an option might make you want to go take a closer
look at that book and buy it. There lies the magic of PCGen - it's
not only extremely useful for generating characters using books you
own, but you can create characters with books you don't own. This
is akin to flipping through the book at the bookstore, except you
brought your dice and a character sheet with you! This way the
publishers get free marketing through PCGen - they can reach gamers
who might not otherwise have heard of them or their book. So both
gamers and game publishers win.
  </p>
  <p>
   PCGen is open source and therefore free. We have a lot of
developers who donate their time to work on this labor of love -
these are the Code Monkeys listed in the About window within PCGen.
Since PCGen is written in Java it works on any computer which can
run Java - which is almost all of them! We also have a lot of List
Monkeys who generously donate their time to work on the data files.
We're always looking for new recruits, if you'd like to help
complete the conversion of a certain book, or you'd like to see a
book added that we haven't included yet, let us know at the
aforementioned yahoo message board. Creating the data-files is
fairly easy and we're always glad to help train new monkeys! We're
endeavoring to make it so you can add and modify the data from
within PCGen itself, but at the moment editing the data files is
done with your favorite text editor (WordPad, Textpad, Edit and
even VI!).

   From the Benevolent Dictator
  </h2>
  <p>
   PCGen began in October of 2000 as my own personal project - both
to teach myself Java and as an aid to help convert my high-level
campaign from 1ed to 3e. Just for fun I put it on the net and was
amazed when others wanted to get involved. Things quickly picked up
and the pace has never slackened. It's been a lot of fun and very
rewarding to see how its progressed. The product you have before
you is the result of 7 years of continuous effort on the part of
many people. As the Benevolent Dictator of PCGen I am extremely
thrilled at how much time others have put into it!

  <p>
   PCGen has been a labour of love and a serious addiction for many
of us Monkeys, it still continues to be a fun and challenging place
to be! Over the last two years the project has continued to thrive
and we are now firmly in the semi professional Open Source space. I
am exceedingly proud of what this team has managed to build so far
and am extremely grateful for the massive community input. We have
a roadmap for at least another 2-3 years, so the future is looking
bright!
