   Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate
what you would see in a LST file we are going to use certain
conventions to convey these ideas.

     &lt;TAB&gt; Delimiting

   <dd>
    Tags in LST files are &lt;TAB&gt; delimited, that is, the tags
are separated by TABs. Because this is difficult to show, the LST
examples will have their tags separated by simple line breaks with
no additional indentation.

     Implementation Description:
    </strong>
    A detailed
description of the implementation, including a summary of the LST
files (i.e. feat.lst, class.lst, etc.) and LST objects (i.e. feats,
spells, deities, etc.), that will be required. If the rule being
implemented has been incorporated into a PCGen distributed set,
this sub-section will also include instructions for using the rule
in new LST objects.

    <strong>
     LST File Entry:
    </strong>
    Discussion of each LST file
being modified is provided and includes an explanation of each tag
used for the specific implementation of the required LST objects.
The information presented here is similar to that found in the
    <a href="../../navlistindex.html" target="navigation">
     LST File Tag
Index
    </a>
    , but is tailered to the specific requirements of the
implementation.

    Any issues or quirks with the LST
code are briefly mentioned. This may involve specific user
instructions or simple "things to remember".

     LST File Entry Examples:

    An example of each of
the LST objects recuired to implement the subject rule is provided

Simple objects are presented using the minimum tags required to
make a functional LST object.
