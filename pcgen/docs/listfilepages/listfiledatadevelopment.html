  <h1>
   New Source Development
  </h1>
  <p>
   This is the process for developing datasets for inclusion in
PCGen. Those familiar with how this process has worked in the past
will note that it is essentially unchanged with the exception that
the point at which a review of the source for OGL compliance
and Publisher permission needed before the source can be entered
into the Git repository is now handled on an internal issue by the
Publisher Liaison, Data License and Content Silverbacks.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Initial Development
  </h2>
  <p>
   It begins as always with our volunteers creating the datasets.
The style of this stage of development is entirely up the
individual monkey who is developing the set, they are free to
upload the work to pcgen_experimental for review or not. Smaller
sources being done by individually monkeys should ideally be
complete or near complete before being submitted for entry into
Git. Larger projects, such as core sources or SRD additions that
are being developed by several monkeys which could benefit from the
cooperative nature of Git do not have to be complete but should be
a good ways towards this point. It will be the Lead Data Monkeys
call when it should be submitted.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Resources
  </h2>
  <p>
   The following resources are available to aid volunteers learn to
create LST files. The first place to go is the Documentation, which
you are reading now. There are a variety of pages dealing with LST
files designed to help get you up and running. For beginners we
have a growing section of lessons in the
   <a href="lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">
    LST file Class
   </a>
   . If you
are creating datasets for inclusion in PCGen you should pay close
attention to the section on
   <a href="listfileLSTstandards.html">
    Official Release LST standards
   </a>
   especially to the section on
   <a href="listfileLSTstandards.html#ogl">
    OGL Compliance
   </a>
   . The docs are
also available
   <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/autobuilds/pcgen-docs/index.html">
    online
   </a>
   on our
   <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/autobuilds/">
    autobuild
site
   </a>
   and are updated periodically.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the main
   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/">
    PCGen Yahoo group
   </a>
   we
have several other lists to aid in data development.
   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/">
    pcgen_experimental
   </a>
   is used for development. You can get in touch with other data
monkeys here and upload your files for others to review. It is a
good place to coordinate activity if multiple monkeys are working
on a source. Additionally it is the place where new LST syntax and
new tags are developed.
   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp/">
    PCGenListFileHelp
   </a>
   is the place to go for help with specific how-to problems with LST
files.
   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LSTfileclass/">
    LSTFileClass
   </a>
   is a
group set up to publish lessons on how to create LST files. The LST
File Classes here in the docs were originally published there.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Inclusion in Git
  </h2>
  <p>
   When a source has been completed and is ready for inclusion in
the program it may be submitted in one of several ways. Data sets
can be uploaded to
   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/">
    pcgen_experimental
   </a>
   to the appropriate folder and, along with a shout out to your
friendly neighborhood tracker monkey, they will be picked up for
review. Once submitted the data must pass an internal review before
it can be included in the Git repository.
  </p>
  <p>
   When a new source is submitted for inclusion in PCGen an
internal issue is opened for the Source. This is a special issue
for tracking New Source Development and will be the repository for
all permission and OGL status reports concerning the source. This
issue will only contain permission and OGL status reports, bug
reports and the like will be entered in separately in the regular
issues. It will be closed when it has passed all the required
reviews and is checked in to the Git repository.
  </p>
  <p>
   New submission issues will be opened by the Content Silverback
or the Chief Data Monkey. The dataset will be checked for obvious
errors that would prevent it from running in PCGen as well as for
completeness. Basically we are checking for show stoppers and not
much more. If we find a major problem we will contact the author to
get it resolved.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the dataset meets these minimum requirement it is zipped up
and attached to the issue. The issue is then reassigned to the Open
Game License (OGL) personnel. If problems are found the issue is
reassigned back to Data who will work to resolve the issue. Once
resolved issue is again reassigned to OGL.
  </p>
  <p>
   When OGL passes the Source it is reassigned to Publisher Liaison
(PL) who will attach publisher permission to the issue, though the
PL need not wait for this step and may attach permissions at any
time he receives them.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the source has passed OGL and PL the issue is reassigned to
the Lead Data Monkey who will commit the dataset in the appropriate
directory. The issue is then closed.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Alpha Development
  </h2>
  <p>
   At this point the dataset author will be invited to continue
development and be granted Git access to continue work on the set.
QA should be informed that a new set is in Git which needs to be
reviewed. The author, the QA team and the Tracker Monkey team will
then work together to bring the set up to release quality. Once the
Dataset has been though the QA process and all known issues have
been resolved it is moved into a permanent location in the data
directory.
