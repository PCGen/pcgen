   This is the beginning of several lessons that will be necessary
to cover the creation of a race file. There are many tags, and some
of them will take some seriously long explanations, so get some
munchies and a drink, get comfortable and we'll get started.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the race lines can get exceedingly long, and yahoo will
wrap my lessons, I'll also post a file that may be perused as
you're reading this. (Be sure to turn off word-wrap on your text
file reader!)
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm going to develop a file that contains two races. One will be
from the System Reference Document (SRD) so you can see how 
to do an already existing race and the other I'm going to make up
on the fly and use to demonstrate every tag I can remember. :p
  </p>
  <p>
   One thing to note is that these will be considered "monster"
races. Towards the end of the lesson i'll go back through and
create a player character only race.
  </p>
  <p>
   We'll do a Solar and, ummm, I know! Ninja Monkeys! :) The
lessons will follow the format of a standard monster write up. A
sample monster write up for our Ninja Monkey race is presented
below so you can follow along (in RSRD format)

  <hr/>
  <p>
   First, a couple of general rules:  Every tag needs to be
separated with tabs. Spaces may be used within names, etc, but
never at the beginning or end. There should never be a space-tab or
a tab-space combination as this will make the parser choke and
die.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although any text editor will do, a text editor that can do
syntax colorization is also a good idea. I use a program called
TextPad. You can also use UltraEdit and I believe there is one
called Crimson. You can find a number of these syntax files on the
Yahoo! Group
   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental">
    PCGen_experimental
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   I'll use "mystuff_races.lst" as the file name. This conforms to
the new naming convention adopted by the PCGen lstmonkey crew
recently. Basically it is in the format of
"source_filetype.lst".
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   These classes were originally written using the SRD (3.0 rules).
Throughout you will find sidebars like this one with notes on the
differences between the 3.0 rule set and the 3.5 rule set as found
in the Revised System Reference Document (RSRD).
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   Race Name
  </p>
  <p>
   The race file is currently a lst file that has one racial entry
per line. The first thing on each line is the race name. There is
no tag for it, the program assumes that whatever is there is the
name of a race.
  </p>
  <p>
   One thing to consider when entering the race name is grouping
(all demons together, etc). A Solar is a celestial, and we'd like
it to show up with other celestials, so the name I'm going to enter
will be "Celestial (Solar)". On the next Line I'll enter "Ninja
Monkey".
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   In the RSRD the Solar is listed as an Angel not a Celestial.
Therefore we would name it "Angel (Solar)".
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>OUTPUTNAME</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, "Celestial (Solar)", while making it easy to find in the
race list with the other celestials will look kind of funny on
output, so we'll use the OUTPUTNAME tag to change what will appear
on output (if the user has the preference checked to use it).
  </p>
  <p>
   The OUTPUTNAME tag can be used in a couple of different manners.
You can completely change the name of an object (as far as output
is concerned) and not reference the real name at all, or you can
use part of the real name. A special string was developed to grant
access to only the text contained in parentheses. That string is
"[NAME]" (no quotes).
  </p>
  <p>
   So, if we wanted the name on output to be "Celestial, Solar", we
could do it two different ways. 1) OUTPUTNAME:Celestial, Solar or
2) OUTPUTNAME:Celestial, [NAME].  I don't like either one of
those... I just want it to be called a "Solar" on output, so I'm
entering the tag like this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>OUTPUTNAME:[NAME]</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The name "Ninja Monkey" is just fine as it is, so we'll skip an
OUTPUTNAME tag on this one.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     SIZE
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   Every creature has a size.  The size tag uses the first
letter of each size category, so the possible choices are F (Fine),
D (Diminutive), T (Tiny), S (Small), M (Medium), L (Large), H
(Huge), G (Gargantuan), and C (Colossal).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar is a Large creature so on that line we'll enter a
couple tabs and then put "
   <code>SIZE:L</code>
   ". The Ninja Monkey is
man-sized (Medium), so we'll put "
   <code>SIZE:M</code>
   " on that
line.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     RACETYPE/RACESUBTYPE
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   After the creature's size the next information is the race type.
For the Solar it is listed as Outsider (Good). The information in
the brackets after the type lists all the subtypes for the monster,
in this case Good. We will enter "
   <code>RACETYPE:Outsider</code>
   "
put in a tab and enter "
   <code>RACESUBTYPE:Good</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Ninja Monkey we have to enter just the type with no
subtypes.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="sidebar">
   <strong>
    Update to RSRD
   </strong>
   <br/>
   The Solar changes subtypes in the RSRD to Outsider (Angel,
Extraplanar, Good). Therefore we need to change our subtype entry
to read
   <code>RACESUBTYPE:Angel|Extraplanar|Good</code>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     TYPE
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   This use of TYPE has been deprecated and
is replaced with
   <code>RACETYPE/RACESUBTYPE</code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   We use the TYPE tag to indicate what type of creature the race
is (Aberration, Undead, Animal, Monstrous Humanoid, Magical Beast,
etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar is an Outsider so our tag would read
"
   <code>TYPE:Outsider</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ninja monkey is a Monstrous Humanoid so our tag would be
"
   <code>TYPE:Monstrous Humanoid</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     MONSTERCLASS
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   The MONSTERCLASS tag is used by the program when the "Default
Monster" setting is off. It tells it how many and which monster
class levels to give the race (as opposed to using the HITDICE tag
when in "Default Monster" mode).
  </p>
  <p>
   The tag takes the format of
MONSTERCLASS:&lt;monsterclassname&gt;:&lt;levels&gt;. For PCGen
distribution files the class name is *usually* the type of creature
and the number of levels is usually set equal to the number of HD
the default creature has. An exception to this is when the racial
description says they are spellcasters... "cast as 18th level
sorcerers". In that case we create a special class (in a class.lst
file) to grant the race the appropriate spellcasting levels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar is an Outsider with 22 HD, and he casts spells as a
20th level cleric, so his tag would be
"
   <code>MONSTERCLASS:Solar:22</code>
   "
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Ninja Monkey, he's a Monstrous Humanoid and has 4 HD and
no spellcasting ability, so the tag for him would read
"
   <code>MONSTERCLASS:Monstrous Humanoid:4</code>
   ".
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <code><strong>
     HITDICE
    </strong></code>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   The PCGen data team is moving away from
using the "Default Monster" setting. Default Monster Kits are being
used instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is the tag we use to indicate the die size and quantity of
hit dice a race gets. The program uses this when the "Default
Monster" setting in the preferences is on. It takes the format of
HITDICE:&lt;quantity&gt;,&lt;size&gt;. This information is found at
the top of each race listing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Solar has 22d8 hit points, so would have
"
   <code>HITDICE:22,8</code>
   " for this tag.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ninja monkey has 4d8 hit points, so would have
"
   <code>HITDICE:4,8</code>
   " for this tag.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <code>MOVE</code>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   To define a race's movement modes and rates we use the MOVE tag.
The format is "MOVE:mode,rate,mode,rate".   You can enter
as many movement modes and rates as you want.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at the Solar in the SRD, they list "SPEED:50ft,fly
150ft". The first number is always their "Walk" (otherwise known as
"Base") movement rate, except for those races that can't walk like
some plants. So on the Solar's line we will enter (remember to put
a tab or two between the last tag and this new one):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>MOVE:Walk,50,Fly,150</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   I'm going to give the Ninja Monkey a walk rate of 30 and a climb
rate of 20, so the tag for his line would be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>MOVE:Walk,30,Climb,20</code>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
