   This tutorial will cover the use of prerequisite
tags (which we refer to as PRExxx tags in general) in feats as they
relate to actually qualifying for the feat. They may also be used
to limit the application of the benefits of the feat, but that
usage will be discussed in the tutorial on the BONUS tags at a
later time.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   As with the CHOOSE tag from the previous
tutorial, there are *many* PRExxx tags. I will cover some of the
ones I believe you might commonly see/use, but for a full listing
and syntax rules, you should browse the PRExxx section of the
documentation included with PCGen.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   A few general notes in regards to using PRExxx
tags in feats:
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   1) To be a feat PRExxx (used to qualify you to
actually take the feat itself) it must *not* be attached to another
tag.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   2) You may put as many PRExxx tags on a feat
line as you want and *all* must be met before the feat can be taken
(unless the feat is granted by a tag that allows the user to bypass
PRExxx tags, such as the VFEAT tag).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   3) You may use PRExxx attached to other tags
within the feat to control what bonuses are applied and where and
when, but they will not be used in the determination of whether or
not you can take the feat itself. While VFEAT will bypass PRExxx
tags for the taking of the feat, the ones attached to other tag
will still be active.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   4) The general format of a PRExxx tag is either
PRExxx:#,y=z,y=z for those that compare something to a number or
PRExxx:#,z,z for those that do not compare to a number.; The #
determines how many of the y=z pairs (or z specs) you must qualify
for to be considered as having met the prereq. Although, as with
almost everything in life, there are exceptions.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   5) In the documentation, some of these tags are
referred to as "Global". This means that they are supposed to work
in any file type (feat, template, spell, etc.) *NOT* that they will
work with any tag. This is an important distinction. If a tag is
not documented as being able to have PRExxx tags applied, then it
most likely will not function if you try to do so.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   6) When a PRExxx tag is doing a comparison with
a number, it is assumed to be met if equal to or greater than in
most instances. Those tags that do not function this way have
suffixes (explained further below) that modify the comparison
behavior.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   7) Any PRExxx tag may be prefixed with a "!"
character (!PRExxx) in order to invert the requirement. The PRExxx
tag will be evaluated as normal, then the result reversed (meaning
you CAN NOT have the things listed in this tag) when determining
whether the prerequisite is passed or not.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    EQ, NEQ, GT, LT, GTEQ, LTEQ
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   There are several tags that do comparisons other
than the normal "greater than or equal to" that is the standard. In
these cases there are suffixes that get attached to the tag to tell
it what type of comparison is desired to make it evaluate as true.
Those tags that these suffixes go with will not function without
them, so make sure and note which tags use them.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The suffixes and their meanings are:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    EQ - &gt; Equal
    <br/>
    NEQ -&gt; Not Equal
    <br/>
    LT -&gt; Less Than
    <br/>
    LTEQ -&gt; Less Than or Equal
    <br/>
    GT -&gt; Greater Than
    <br/>
    GTEQ -&gt; Greater Than or Equal
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent1">
   So when in use you would basically see "&lt;base
tag&gt;EQ" or "&lt;base tag&gt;LTEQ:", and that is the condition
that must be satisfied for that PRExxx tag to be evaluated to
true.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   I will note which tags take these suffixes when
I cover them below.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PREALIGN
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag is one of the exceptions mentioned
above to the standard PRExxx format rule. This one takes the format
of PREALIGN:&lt;align1&gt;,&lt;align2&gt;,etc. To pass this PRExxx
you need only meet one of the listed criteria.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   You may use number or text representations for
the alignments. The identifiers for the alignments are as
follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    0 or LG = Lawful Good
    <br/>
    1 or LN = Lawful Neutral
    <br/>
    2 or LE = Lawful Evil
    <br/>
    3 or NG = Neutral Good
    <br/>
    4 or TN = True Neutral
    <br/>
    5 or NE = Neutral Evil
    <br/>
    6 or CG = Chaotic Good
    <br/>
    7 or CN = Chaotic Neutral
    <br/>
    8 or CE = Chaotic Evil
    <br/>
    9 or None = None
    <br/>
    10 or Deity = Deity's alignment
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREALIGN:LG,CG</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must be Lawful Good or Chaotic Good
alignment
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREALIGN:Deity</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Character's alignment must match that of their
chosen deity.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PREATT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag checks the value of the characters Base
Attack Bonus (the attack bonuses granted from class advancement and
race). If the character's BAB is equal to or greater than the
number given the PRExxx is met.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This is another tag that does not follow the
standard format. It takes the form of PREATT:#.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Example:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREATT:3</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Characters BAB must be 3 or greater
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PRECHECK/PRECHECKBASE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   These tags compare the value of the
check(s)/saving throw(s) against the number(s) you supply in the
tag and if the value of the check is equal to or higher than the
prereq value given, the prereq is considered to be met.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The PRECHECKBASE compares the base save (defined
in game play as the total from classes... in program terms, it will
add in anything defined by BONUS:CHECKS|BASE.&lt;checkname&gt;|#).
The PRECHECK compares the total (which would include bonuses from
items, stats, etc.) of the check to the given number.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The check/save to be checked *must* be one of
the ones defined in your gamemode files or the tag will fail.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=1,Reflex=3</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Would evaluate as true if the character's base
Fortitude meets or exceeds 1 or their base Reflex meets or exceeds
3
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRECHECK:2,Fortitude=2,Will=2,Reflex=2</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Would evaluate as true if any 2 of the 3 three
listed conditions were met.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PRECLASS
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag is used to check class levels, and
whether the character meets or exceeds the specified level(s). The
general format is
PRECLASS:#,&lt;classparameter&gt;=&lt;level&gt;.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   You can reference the classes in several ways;
by explicit name, type (TYPE.Base, TYPE.PC, TYPE.Monster,
TYPE.Prestige, etc), whether the character has spellcasting levels
in general (SPELLCASTER) or of a specific type (SPELLCASTER.Arcane
or SPELLCASTER.Divine).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Example:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRECLASS:1,Fighter=3</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have three levels in the Fighter class
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRECLASS:2,TYPE.Prestige=1,SPELLCASTER=3</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have one Prestige level and three levels in
a spellcasting class
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=1</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have one level in an arcane casting
class
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PREEQUIP
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This PRExxx checks for equipment items that you
have equipped. It will ignore items that are not set as
"equipped".
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The format for this tag is
PREEQUIP:#,&lt;itemspecifier&gt;,&lt;itemspecifier&gt;,etc. The
item may be specified by name or by type (which refers to the TYPE
tag used in the equipment definition file). If you use the name
option you may use a wildcard (the % symbol) in it.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   You may also specify the item by it's wield
category (by using WIELDCATEGORY=... this basically referring to
weapons). You may use any wield category that is defined in the
game mode files.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREEQUIP:1,Longsword</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have an item with the exact name "Longsword"
equipped.
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREEQUIP:2,TYPE=Armor,TYPE=Shield</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have both a piece of equipment with "Armor"
contained in its TYPE tag and one with "Shield" contained in its
TYPE tag equipped.
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREEQUIP:1,WIELDCATEGORY=OneHanded</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have a weapon equipped that has a wield
category of One Handed.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PREFEAT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Used to check for the character having the
specified feats (or not having them when reversed. This tag is used
very frequently, so it would be advisable to learn this one
well.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag has a slightly different format in that
there are not x=y pairs. The basic format is PREFEAT:x,y,z. The x
is the number of feats (or instances of the same feat in certain
circumstances) that the character must have. Y is an optional
parameter called "CHECKMULT" that makes the tag count each instance
of a feat that can be taken multiple times separately. For example:
if you do not use the CHECKMULT tag and are checking for the Spell
Focus feat and the character had it in three different schools, it
would only count as one feat. Z would be the feat parameters
themselves.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag also has a special option to allow you
to specify that the character *doesn't* have a certain feat (while
still specifying that they do have others). This is done by
enclosing the feat specification in brackets.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The feat specifications can be done either by
the feat name or the feat type. For feats that have choices, you
can specify the general feat only, or a certain specific version of
it by adding the specific choice in parentheses following the feat
name (with no space in between).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREFEAT:1,Dodge,Combat Reflexes</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have the Dodge feat or the Combat Reflexes
feat
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREFEAT:2,TYPE=Fighter</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have two feats with a type of Fighter
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREFEAT:2,CHECKMULT,Spell Focus</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have any two Spell Focus feats
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREFEAT:1,Spell
Focus(Evocation)</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have Spell Focus in the Evocation
school
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREFEAT:2,CHECKMULT,Spell Focus,[Spell
Focus(Evocation)]</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have two Spell Focus feats, and *not* have
Spell Focus(Evocation)
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PREITEM
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This PRExxx checks for items in a characters
possession. Note that these items do not have to be equipped or
carried, they must just appear in the characters inventory.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   It has the general format of
PREITEM:#,&lt;itemparameter&gt;. The item may be specified by name
or by type (which refers to the TYPE tag used in the equipment
definition file). If you use the name option you may use a wildcard
(the % symbol) in it.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREITEM:1,Longsword</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   <code>Must have an item named
"Longsword"</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREITEM:1,Longsword %</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have an item that has Longsword as the
beginning of the name. This would match "Longsword +1" and
"Longsword (Soulstealer)" but not "Soulstealer Longsword"
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREITEM:2,Longsword,Shortsword</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have a "Longsword" and a "Shortsword"
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREITEM:2,TYPE=Sword,TYPE=Sword</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have two different items that have "Sword"
in the TYPE tag of their .lst definition
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PRELEVEL
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag checks for the total number of class
levels. Note that it includes monster hit dice and levels.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The format is PRELEVEL:#, where # represents the
total number of levels the character must meet or exceed to pass
the PRExxx.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRELEVEL:4</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Character must have at least four levels between
all class levels, monstrous hit dice or monstrous class levels.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PRELEVELMAX
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag sets the maximum level. It only counts
character (non-monster) levels. To meet the PRExxx you must be of
the specified character level or lower.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   A special note about this token: when used as a
PRExxx for a feat you will not be allowed to take the feat after
the specified level, but as long as you take the feat before you
reach that level you will still receive the benefits of the feat
even after you are above the level specified (however, it *will*
show in red on your feat list in the GUI).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRELEVELMAX:3</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Character may not have more than three character
(class) levels
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PREMOVE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag checks that the character meets or
exceeds the specified types/rates of movement specified. It takes
the format of
PREMOVE:#,&lt;movementtype&gt;=&lt;movementrate&gt;,etc.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREMOVE:1,Climb=10,Brachiate=10</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Character must have a Climb movement rate of 10'
or more or a Brachiate movement rate of 10' or more
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREMOVE:2,Walk=30,Fly=30</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Character must have both a Walk movement rate of
30' and a Fly movement rate of 30'
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PREMULT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag in itself does not check anything. It
is used to allow the combination of different types of PRExxx tags
into one. This helps cover those options where you have a PRExxx
that states "Must have the Dodge feat or Dex of 15" (that "or" in
there is the kicker that couldn't be handled prior to this tag
being created).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag may also be nested within itself.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The tag takes the following format:
PREMULT:#,[&lt;PRExxx&gt;],[&lt;PRExxx&gt;]. The number is the number of
the other bracketed PRExxx conditions you need to meet.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREMULT:1,[PREFEAT:1,Dodge],[PRESTAT:1,DEX=15]</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have the Dodge feat or a Dex of 15
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PREMULT:1,[PREMULT:2,[PREATT:3],[PRESTAT:1,STR=15]],[PREFEAT:1,CombatExpertise]</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have Strength of 15 and a base attack bonus
of 3 *OR* have the Combat Expertise feat
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    PRERACE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tags can check for a characters race, race
type (as defined by the TYPE tag), racial type (as defined by the
RACETYPE tag), or racial subtype (as defined by the RACESUBTYPE
tag).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   Using this PRExxx you can do things such as
checking for Incorporeal Undead, Giants, etc.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   There are a couple of special additions for this
tag. First, as in a few other tags you may use the % symbol as a
wildcard. Second, if you wish to exclude a race, you may put square
brackets around it.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   <strong>
    Examples:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRERACE:1,Dwarf</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must be a Dwarf
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRERACE:2,RACETYPE=Undead,RACESUBTYPE=Incorporeal</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have both a race type of "Undead" and a
subtype of "Incorporeal"
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Giant</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">
   Must have a race type of "Giant"
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
   <code>PRERACE:1,Elf%,[Elf (High)]</code>
  </p>
  <p class="indent3">

    PRESIZE
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag checks the characters current size. It
is one of the tags that I wrote about in the introduction that
requires a suffix (EQ, GTEQ, LT, etc). So what you would actually
see in the .lst files would be "PRESIZEGTEQ" or "PRESIZELT",
etc.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The one oddity to this tag is that it does not
compare to a number but to a letter representing the different
sizes. Those letters are (and in order from least to greatest):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    F = Fine
    <br/>
    D = Diminutive
    <br/>
    T = Tiny
    <br/>
    S = Small
    <br/>
    M = Medium
    <br/>
    L = Large
    <br/>
    H = Huge
    <br/>
    G = Gargantuan
    <br/>
    C = Colossal

spellcasting ability.

  <p class="indent1">
   You may specify that it be in divine casting
classes, arcane casting classes, or psionic and you specify how
many of spells of a certain level are required. You may use
"Arcane|Divine" in the &lt;spelltype&gt; slot to specify Arcane

    PRETEXT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This is a unique PRExxx tag in that it doesn't
check for anything. :)
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   It is used to show a requirement that is
(usually) not a game mechanic and hence not coded into PCGen so
that it can be checked. Anything put in this tag will be displayed
in the PCGen GUI so the user knows what the requirement is, but
beyond that it will not prevent the user from taking the feat or
template.

  <p class="indent1">
   The format it simply PRETEXT:&lt;text&gt;

    PREVAR
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This tag checks the value of program or user
created variables. It is one of the tags that I wrote about in the
introduction that requires a suffix (EQ, GTEQ, LT, etc). So what
you would actually see in the .lst files would be "PREVARGTEQ" or
"PREVARLT", etc.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This is one of the most commonly used PRExxx
tags in .lst files. It can be used to check the values of any of
the computer generated variables (these are usually indicated by
being entirely capitalized), such as SPELLFAILURE and HP. For a
list of all the computer generated variables, see the documentation
for the DEFINE tag. It may also be used to check the value of any
variable defined by the user via a DEFINE tag in the dataset
(distinguished by having the first letter of each word capitalized
with no spaces in between).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   It takes the format of
PREVAR&lt;suffix&gt;:&lt;varname&gt;,&lt;value&gt;

   To bring us back to our feat topic, I will add
the required PRExxx for the Improved Critical feat.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   "Prerequisite: Proficient with weapon, base
attack bonus +8". We dealt with the proficiency requirement in our
CHOOSE statement (it offers only weapons you are proficient with)
so we can leave that one out, which leaves the base attack bonus of
8. If you look up a ways you'll see we need to use the PREATT tag.
So it would be "PREATT:8".
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   For quick reference, we currently have the
following for our feat so far (new lines should tab
characters):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <code>Improved Critical
     <br/>
     TYPE:General.Fighter
     <br/>
     PREATT:8
     <br/>
     MULT:YES
     <br/>
     STACK:NO
     <br/>
     CHOOSE:WEAPONPROFS|LIST|1
     <br/>
     DESC:With your selected weapon you know how to hit where it
hurts.
     <br/>
     BENEFIT:When using the weapon you selected, your threat range is
doubled.
