     PCGen is configured to launch the "Load Sources" window when
launched for the first time after a clean install.
    </p>
    <p class="center">

    </p>
    <p>
     If the window does not pop-up upon launching of PCGen you can
call it up by selecting the "Load Sources" item on the "Settings"
menu. This can be found under the
     <a href="../menupages/settings/settingssourceloadingoption.html">

     To load one of the standard configurations, listed below, simply
select the set desired and then click the
     <strong>
      LOAD
     </strong>
     button near the lower-right of the window. PCGen will then switch
to the appropriate GameMode and will load the sets contained in the
selected configuration file.

    <p>
     As of PCGen 5.17.x, the Standard Configurations provided as part
of the basic mode of source loading include the following sets:

    Creating New
Source Collections
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   The source collections made available as part of the basic
source loading mode are a small fraction, albeit popular, subset of
the data sets available within PCGen and chances are that you will
eventually want to add a few of these additional sets to your
loaded sets. The previous section covers how to add the additional
data sets but if you add enough additional sets on a regular basis
you are likely to want a new short-cut to load all of those files.
PCGen has the ability to create this short-cut for you and make it
available as part of the basic source loading window.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the steps listed below will help you in the creation
of a customized "Source Collection":
  </p>
  <ol class="indent2">
   <li>
    <p>
     Open the "Load Sources" window and click on the "Add"
button.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
     <img alt="Basic Load Sources Window" src="../images/windows/load_sources.png"/>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     On the "Create New Source Collection" window you will need to
select, with the pull-down menu, the
     <strong>
      GameMode
     </strong>
     with
which you will be working. Click "Ok".
    </p>
    <p class="center">
     <img alt="Create New Source Collection Window" src="../images/windows/createnewsourcecollection1.png"/>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Move the data sets you wish to load from the left "Available
Source Material" pane, to the right "Selected Source Material"
pane. This is done similarly to the way data sets are loaded under
the
     <a href="walkthroughloadcampaignadvanced.html">
      Advanced
Mode
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="center">
     <img alt="Create New Source Collection Window" src="../images/windows/createnewsourcecollection2.png"/>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Enter a "Source Collection Title" in the field at the bottom of
the window and click "ok".
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Congratulations!
     </strong>
     You have now successfully
created a custom Source Collection.
