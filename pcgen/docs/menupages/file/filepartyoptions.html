   Party Options
  </h1>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Party
   </strong>
   command provides a number of options
that make managing groups of PCs easier.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Party Options" src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_party.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Party
   </strong>
   command opens up a new set of options
for the user to use.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Opening a Party" src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partyopen.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Open Party
   </strong>
   option opens a party file from
the last folder PCgen used to save a file in. The
   <strong>
    Open
   </strong>
   window will pop up and the user can select
the desired
   <strong>
    Party
   </strong>
   file and click
   <strong>
    Open
   </strong>
   . Party files use the
   <span class=':lstfile"'>
    .pcp
   </span>
   file extension..
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Close Party
   </strong>
   option closes the party files,
saving and unloading all PCs currently loaded.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="center">
   <img alt="Saving a Party" src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partysave.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Save Party
   </strong>
   option allows the user to save
all the PCs currently loaded as a "party". The
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   window will pop up and prompt the user for
the party name. Enter the party name and click the
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   button and PCGen will save the party. This in
turn allows the user to quickly load all PCs in the party. This is
useful for a DM who manages the PCs in his campaign, allowing him
to load all PCs in the party with one file name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Save Party As
   </strong>
   option allows the user to
save the party under a new filename. This functions much as the
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   command does for PCs.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   Below the
   <strong>
    Save Party
   </strong>
   commands you will find a
list of the most recently closed or saved parties. These are
included here to allow convenient loading directly from this
menu.
