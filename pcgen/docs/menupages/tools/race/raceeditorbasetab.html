  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Base Tab
   </strong>
   has everything required to make a
simple Race.  The remaining tabs are for more advanced Race
creation.  The Races created will be saved into the
data/custom directory under the name of customRaces.lst.
  </p>

used in the Inventory, Equipping screen which asks which hand to
use the weapon (Shows as Primary Hand, Secondary Hand, Secondary
Hand 2, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Legs
   </strong>
   is where you will enter the number of
legs for your race has. It is used to determine encumbrance and

  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Bonus Skill Points / Level
   </strong>
   is where you
will enter additional skill points that your race receives with

  </p>
  <p>
   The

starts out as Large, with 4 HD. 5-16 it is Huge, 17-32 it is
Gargantuan, 33+ it is Colossal. 99 HD is the maximum it can ever
raise to so it's HD advancement would be 4,16,32,99)
