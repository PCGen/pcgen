  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Base Tab
   </strong>
   has everything required to make a
simple Class.Â  The remaining tabs are for more advanced Class
creation. The Classes created will be saved into the data/custom
directory under the name of customClasses.lst.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Deity Name
   </strong>
   is where you will enter the name
for your deity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Holy Item
   </strong>
   is where you will enter the
name/description of the holy item for the deity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Deities Alignment
   </strong>
   drop down menu is for
selecting the deity alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Description
   </strong>
   window is where you will type
in a description of the deity (i.e. "God of the Dawn")
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Deity's Favored Weapons
   </strong>
   windows,
   <strong>
    Available
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Selected
   </strong>
   are used
to create a list of all the favored weapons, primarily for use with
the War domain.
  </p>
  <p>
   The weapon names in the
   <strong>
    Available
   </strong>
   window are
drawn from whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you
have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then weapon names
from both sources will appear in the window.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Add
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Remove
   </strong>
   buttons
will move the highlighted weapon between the 2 windows, as will
double clicking on a weapon name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Source
   </strong>
   window, is a text window for listing
what source material the deity is from. If it is a custom created
deity, then you can leave this blank or simply put in "custom"
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Product Identity
   </strong>
   checkbox is to denote if
the deity's name being created is the Product Identity of a
publisher
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <strong>
    Cancel
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Save
   </strong>
   buttons,
which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the deity
creation or save it to the customdeities.lst file.
