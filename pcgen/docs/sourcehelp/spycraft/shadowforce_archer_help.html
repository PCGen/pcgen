   This read me file contains information on how to
make the most of this dataset. Specifically it will alert you to
work-around's for Spycraft rules that PCGen does not currently
support.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Chambers
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   The Chambers are represented in PCGen by a
series of templates which can be found in the bottom pane of the
department tab. They are mutually exclusive as your PC may only
belong to only one at a time. You will need to choose one manually
and they are removable. Any option which has membership in a
certain Chamber as a requirement will use these templates to test
for qualification. Your PC's chosen Chamber will appear on the
output sheet in the list of Templates.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Class Abilities
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   The Psion classes have an ability called Psi
Mastery, which allows the psion to choose a psion skill that he has
at least 1 rank in and gain a bonus in. At this time PCGen will
produce a list of all skills the character has ranks in and cannot
at this time limit the list to just those psionic skills the
character has ranks in, its up to you to select the appropriate
skill.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Feats
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   Several of the basic psion feats provide
enhancements to a chosen psionic skill the character has ranks in.
For that reason you should spend you skill points before taking any
of these feats. Also note that PCGen will produce a list of all
skills the character has ranks in and cannot at this time limit the
list to just those psionic skills the character has ranks in, its
up to you to select the appropriate skill.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The feat
   <strong>
    Heightened Inner
Strength
   </strong>
   is a complicated one that cannot be fully
supported. The main problem is that the feat applies bonuses to the
PC every five levels after the level the PC has chosen the feat and
there is not mechanism in PCGen to test for which level the feat
was added. As a work around there is a second feat in the list
named
   <strong>
    Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses
   </strong>
   which will
allow you to apply the bonuses manually. The first time you add the
Heightened Inner Strength feat you will be given the choice of
which ability to enhance and one feat slot will be used. At the
appropriate level you can add the next ability enhancement by
choosing
   <strong>
    Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses
   </strong>
   which
will offer the same choices but will not cost you a feat slot. This
method used six hidden feats each of which can add up to 2 points
to an ability and in that regard the rules are enforced. Because of
the way this is set up it has the potential to incorrectly add
points to your feat pool. If you choose the
   <strong>
    Heightened
Inner Strength Bonuses
   </strong>
   feat and do not choose an ability
bonus, one point will be incorrectly added to you feat pool. You
can also use the
   <strong>
    Heightened Inner Strength Bonuses
   </strong>
   feat to remove bonuses but bear in mind that this too will
incorrectly add points to your feat pool.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   The feat
   <strong>
    Evolved Mind
   </strong>
   feat will
add skill points to your highest Mentalist class level, so if you
have multi-classed the points will not appear in your current class
skill point pool if that class is not Mentalist. Use the 'Skill
point left for class' pop up menu to find your highest Mentalist
level and spend those points there. Since this feat makes all skill
class skills for the Mentalist it does not matter where there are
spent.
