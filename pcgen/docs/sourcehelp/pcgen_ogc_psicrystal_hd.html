    PCGen Open Gaming Content - Psicrystal
Hit Dice
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The PCGen Open Gaming Content - Psicrystal Hit Dice dataset is
designed to modify Psicrystals in the RSRD Psionics dataset so that
they gain hit dice as the Master progresses in class levels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The need for this originates from certain interpretations of the
Psicrystal rules which hold that Psicrystals gain hit dice as the
Master progresses in class levels and by extension also gain feats
every 3 levels and stat bumps every 4. The dataset was not coded in
this way and the designers apparently never intended this, however
no errata has been published to refute or clarify this
interpretation. This set is provided for those who wish to play
Psicrystals under this interpretation.
  </p>
  <p>
   This set must be loaded with the RSRD Psionics set or the RSRD
Complete set (which includes Psionics). When loaded it adds Hit
Dice (Monster Class Levels) equal to the masters Psionic class
levels. It also adds a point to the feat pool at first, third and
every three levels after. Every four levels it grants a 1 point
increase to an attribute of the users choice.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   An unmodified Psicrystal is granted
Alertness as a virtual feat, this set disables that, Alertness must
be purchased with a feat point if it is desired.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Additional Feature
  </h3>
  <p>
   The rules state that a Psicrystal has at least 4 Ranks in Spot,
Listen, Move Silently, and Search even if it's Master does not.
PCGen cannot implement this automatically so 4 temporary bonuses
can be activated manually by the user to bring the ranks of these
skills up to 4 if the Master is lacking. They can be found in the
Temporary Bonuses sub-tab of the Inventory Tab under templates.
Each starts with the name "Psicrystal Skills" and allows you to set
the Rank from 1 to 4.
