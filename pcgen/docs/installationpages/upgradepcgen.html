   Upgrading PCGen
  </h1>
  <p>
   If you have PCGen Currently installed on your system, you can
overwrite it with a newer version to maintain your settings and the
location of your characters. This will unfortunately, unless you
have taken precautions against it, also overwrite your homebrew
datasets and gamemode folder. This page provides some guidance in
how best to avoid these problems by helping you prepare your
homebrew and custom data for transfer into an updated version of
PCGen.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   NOTE: Additional information about upgrading
PCGen versions may be available in the

   Important Files To Know About before the Upgrade
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   The
   <span class="lstfile">
    options.ini
   </span>
   and
   <span class="lstfile">
    filter.ini
   </span>
   files, see below, are
automatically stored in the users home directory and are picked up
automatically when PCGen is upgraded. If the old files are not
desired, the new
   <span class="lstfile">
    filepaths.ini
   </span>
   file
can be deleted. PCGen will then ask for where the new files are to
be placed.
  </p>
  <dl class="indent1">
   <dt>
    <span class="lstfile">
     filepaths.ini
    </span>
   </dt>
   <dd>
    This file tells PCGen the location of the other ini files so
you can change the
    <span class="lstfile">
     filepaths.ini
    </span>
    to
point to the folder which contains the
    <span class="lstfile">
     options.ini
    </span>
    and
    <span class="lstfile">
     filter.ini
    </span>
    that you want to use.
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <span class="lstfile">
     options.ini
    </span>
   </dt>
   <dd>
    This file holds your PCGen Preferences, such as file paths, so
if you are going to point to your old one you may need to correct
various paths to things such as the location of the output
sheets.
   </dd>
   <dd>
    <p class="sidebar1">
     WARNING: Installing a new version of PCGen over
an old version may cause the new version to not run well. If you
experience some unexpected behavior after upgrading, please try
deleting the
     <span class="lstfile">
      options.ini
     </span>
     file, or you
may choose to rename it in order to preserve the file. The
     <span class="lstfile">
      options.ini
     </span>
     file contains information
on structure and contents that may have changed with the new
version, rendering it useless if different implementations become
mixed in the file.

  <h2>
   Upgrading on the Windows Platform
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   The steps for upgrading PCGen on the Windows
platform are included below:
  </p>
  <ol class="indent1">
   <li>
    Create a new PCGen directory. e.g.
    <em>
     C:\PCGen\PCGen_x.x.x
    </em>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Unzip the pcgenXXX_full.zip into the new folder. (We recommend
that you use the Windows install file for best results.)
   </li>
   <li>
    Copy the old
    <span class="lstfile">
     *.ini
    </span>
    files, custom
datasets, homebrew datasets, and homebrew gamemode files, as
required, back to your PCGen directory.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   Note: Using the Windows installer automatically
installs PCGen in a new folder.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Upgrading on the Macintosh Platform
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   The steps for upgrading PCGen are included
below:
  </p>
  <ol class="indent1">
   <li>
    Download and mount the latest
    <em>
     pcgenXXX_mac_install.dmg
    </em>
    file.
   </li>
   <li>
    Locate the PCGen directory. e.g.
    <em>
     Applications/PCGen_x.x.x
    </em>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Drag and drop
    <em>
     PCGen X.X.X.app
    </em>
    from the dmg file into
the PCGen folder.
   </li>
   <li>
    Copy the old custom datasets, homebrew datasets, and homebrew
gamemode files, as required, to the appropriate folders inside the
PCGen application package. The package contents can be accessed by
Command-Clicking (Right-Click) on the application package and
pulling down to
    <strong>
     Show Package Contents

    Migrating Custom Data
Sets
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   PCGen provides two simple ways of adding your
own data, these are the built-in LST Editors and the starter data
set my_dataset. Both of these need some attention when upgrading
PCGen.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   WARNING: The data syntax for the old version of
PCGen may be incorrect for the new version so before you start up
PCGen you should verify your data's compatibility with the new
version of PCGen. You can check with the PCGen community forums to
find out what tools may be available to help you with this
task.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Migrating Data Created in the LST Editor
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   If, as is recommended, you install PCGen into a
new directory each time you upgrade, you will need to copy over the
data created using the LST Editors. To do this follow these
steps.
  </p>
  <ol class="indent1">
   <li>
    Stop PCGen, if it is currently running. PCGen must not be
running when you copy the files, as PCGen writes a new copy of
these files on exit.
   </li>
   <li>
    Copy the data/customsources folder and all of its contents from
your old PCGen install directory to the new install directory.
   </li>
   <li>
    Start the new version of PCGen and verify that your custom data
is present.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you install PCGen in the same directory as your previous
install, your LST editor data will still be present in the new
version.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
   Migrating Data Created Using the My_Dataset Files
  </h3>
  <p class="indent1">
   PCGen ships with an example set of data files
ready to go to create you own data. This is in the
data/homebrew/my_dataset folder. As the example files ship with
PCGen, it is very important to note that these can be overwritten
by a new PCGen install if you have not renamed the data set and
install the new version of PCGen in the same location as the old
one.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   As a result, we strongly recommend that when
using the my_dataset example files, you create a copy in a new
folder and work with that copy, rather than editing the example
files directly.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   If you install PCGen into a new directory each
time you upgrade, you may need to copy over the data you have
created. If you cannot see your custom data, simply copy over the
folder with your custom data to the same location in the new PCGen
install. The data should then be visible when you restart
PCGen.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   If you are installing PCGen into the same
directory, backup your custom data first, then make sure it does
not use the default my_dataset folder name. Once you are sure your
data is safe, then proceed with the upgrade of PCGen.
   <!--
                        <dt>Custom Datasets</dt>
                                <dd>Custom datasets are datasets that are created and maintained by PCGen through 
                                        the use of the PCGen's built-in LST File Editors. If you have used the built-in LST 
                                        file editors, these files should be backed up as part of your upgrade preparations. 
                                        Once upgrading has been completed, these files can be copied over the new files in 
                                        the $PCEGN_HOME/data/customsources folder.</dd>
                        <dt>Homebrew Datasets</dt>
                        <dd>Homebrew datasets are files that are created and maintained by the user and are generally 
                                stored in the $PCGEN_HOME/data/<your campaign> folder. If you have any homebrew LST 
                                files, these files should be backed up as part of your upgrade preparations. Once upgrading 
                                has been completed, these files can be copied into the new $PCGEN_HOME/data/<your campaign>

                                obsolete or deprecated tags or tag syntax. This means you may have to review and update 
                                any LST objects contained in such files to the latest standard.</p>
