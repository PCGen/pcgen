  <h1>
   Installing PCGen Manually
  </h1>
  <p class="indent1">
   If you have PCGen currently installed on your
system, you can either install the new version into a new directory
or overwrite the old version on your system. The PCGen team
recommends strongly that you install new versions into a new
directory.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Windows Users
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   We recommend that you use the Windows
installer.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Mac Users
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   We recommend that you use the OSX Mac Installer,
   <em>
    pcgenXXX_mac_install.dmg
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   This configuration of the program includes all
the necessary files included with the program package, or app file.
You can still access the files by right clicking the program and
choosing
   <strong>
    Show Package Contents
   </strong>
   . See the notes
included in the installer for all the details.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Other System (or Advanced) Users
  </h2>
  <p class="indent1">
   Pick the package with the features you want and
unzip it. It is highly recommended that you use a new directory for
every new release. Once the package is unzipped, see
   <em>
    docs\index.html
   </em>
   for the full documentation.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   Note: Installing a new version over an old
version of PCGen may not run well. See
   <a href="upgradepcgen.html">
    Upgrading PCGen
   </a>
   for further info.
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   A fresh install is best performed by
   <em>
    unzipping pcgenXXX_full.zip
   </em>
   to a desired folder on your
computer. To run the application, run either
   <em>
    pcgen.jar
   </em>
   (the Java executable) or
   <em>
    pcgen.bat
   </em>
   (Windows, which will
also open a debug window which will display any errors during the
run) or pcgen.sh (UNIX and Linux).
  </p>
  <p class="indent1">
   To transfer characters from one version of PCGen
to the new version of PCGen, copy the pcg files from the
"characters" directory from the old version of PCGen to the new
version.
  </p>
  <p class="sidebar1">
   NOTE: If you copy PCGen from one location to
another you must delete the
   <em>
    options.ini
   </em>
   file. This file
holds directory locations that will no longer be valid! Deleting
the options.ini file will reset PCGen to all its default settings.
As such, note your current settings before proceeding. A new file
will be created when PCGen is started if necessary.
