	XSLT Standard Library

	Version 1.2.1

The XSLT Standard Library is a collection of commonly-used
templates written purely in XSLT.

This release features:
 * New SVG and comparison modules
 * New templates (functions) in string, date-time and math modules.
 * Various bug fixes and patches (see ChangeLog).

Anyone who has useful XSLT templates that feels that they 
may be of use to a wide range of XSLT developers and 
applications is invited to submit their templates for 
inclusion in the library.

  USAGE
  =====

Method 1: Unpack the distribution (see below) and 
include or import either the main stylesheet, stdlib.xsl, 
into your own stylesheet or include/import individual stylesheets 
as needed.

Method 2: Import or include the main stylesheet, or an
individual stylesheet, directly from the project website.
Main stylesheet: http://xsltsl.sourceforge.net/xsl/stdlib.xsl

See http://xsltsl.sourceforge.net/ for further instructions.

xsltsl uses XML Namespaces, so there's no need to worry about 
clashing template names.
