Notes:

1. Variables in the string module have been renamed to 
eliminate the use of QNames, which is problematic in
some XSLT processors.  All variables have been prefixed
by 'xsltsl-'.  User stylesheets should avoid naming
variables or parameters with the same prefix.

2. Some templates in the markup module check their
parameters for error conditions and terminate the
entire stylesheet processing if an error condition is 
found.  In this version this behaviour is not
configurable.
