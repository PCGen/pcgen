/**
 * A DirectionalListMapGraph is a DirectionalGraph. Thus, it requires that all
 * Edges added to the Graph are DirectionalEdges. Failure to abide by this
 * restriction will result in the addition of the edge failing.
 * 
 * This Graph uses normal equality (.equals()) to determine equality for
 * purposes of checking whether nodes and edges are already part of the Graph.
 * 
 * This Graph uses redundant storage to improve query speed for certain methods.
 * In addition to simple lists of the nodes and edges present in a Graph, a Map
 * from each node to the adjacent edges is maintained.
 * 
 * This class provides a more balanced query speed for querying adjacent graph
 * elements. Specifically, an edge knows to which nodes it is connected. To
 * determine which edges a node is connected to requires a query to the Graph.
 * The Map maintained by this class prevents an iteration over the entire List
 * of edges whenever getAdjacentEdgeList(GraphNode n) is called.
 * 
 * If frequent testing of containsNode() or containsEdge() is required in a
 * Graph (and the Graph has a large number of nodes), this is not a good Graph
 * implementation. Because the contains test must iterate through a List, it is
 * significantly slower than other possible implementations. For a Graph
 * implementation that is much faster for such tests, see DirectionalSetMapGraph.
 * 
 * WARNING: This DirectionalListMapGraph contains a CACHE which uses the Nodes as
 * a KEY. Due to the functioning of a Map (it uses the .hashCode() method), if a
 * Node is modified IN PLACE in the Graph (without being removed and readded),
 * it WILL cause the caching to FAIL, because the cache will have indexed the
 * Node by the old hash code. It is therefore HIGHLY advised that this Graph
 * implementation ONLY be used where the Nodes are either Immutable or do not
 * override Object.equals().
 * 
 * Note: It is NOT possible for an Edge to connect to a Node which is not in the
 * graph. There are (at least) two side effects to this limit: (1) If an Edge is
 * added when the Nodes to which it is not connected are not in the Graph, those
 * Nodes will be implicitly added to the graph. (2) If a Node is removed from
 * the Graph, all of the Edges connected to that Node will also be removed from
 * the graph.
 * 
 * WARNING: This Graph has SIDE EFFECTS. When any Node is deleted from the
 * graph, ANY and ALL DirectionalEdges connected to that Node are implicitly
 * deleted from the graph. You CANNOT rely on the GraphNodeRemoved event, as it
 * will occur AFTER all of the attached Edges have been removed. You must check
 * for and clean up adjacent Edges BEFORE removing any Node if you wish for
 * those Edges to remain (in a modified form, of course) in the
 * DirectionalListMapGraph.
 * 
 * @param <N>
 *            The type of Node stored in this Graph
 * @param <ET>
 *            The type of Edge stored in this Graph
