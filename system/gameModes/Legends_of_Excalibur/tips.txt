<b>Welcome to PCGen!</b><br>If you ever need help, hit F1 or see the Documentation in the Help menu. The Character Creation Walkthrough is a great place to start.
The "Things to be Done" list in the bottom left of the Summary tab will guide you on what needs to be done for your character. You can even click on an item to be taken to the appropriate tab and field. 
PCGen supports a huge range of source books. Some of the most popular combinations have been set up for you in the Basic list of sources. However you can always create your own combinations on the Advanced sources tab and click Save Source Selection so they show up on the Basic list for you next time. 
Use the File > Export or File > Print to output great character sheets. We support HTML and PDF output as well as output to files which can be loaded into real time tools.
Using the Qualified toggle buttons on each tab will trim the list down to just the options that you can take.
The Affordable toggle button on the Purchase tab only shows those items you have the funds for.

Don't forget, in 3e and 35e mode, bonus skill points from intelligence are only applied at the time, not retroactively, so if you increase your intelligence later on, you will not get bonus skill points from your previous levels.
If you have a positive Intelligence modifier remember to choose your bonus languages at first level, selecting them after first level is not allowed unless you enable the house rule to bypass this restriction. Click the 'Lang, Weap Prof &amp; SA' button on the Summary Tab to select Languages. See the preferences for House Rules options.

At the top of each list is a search box - start typing to search for something, press the X button to clear the search.
You can right-click the heading of the first column in most lists to choose how you want the contents grouped.
Try right clicking on lists to see extra options, including bulk buying and selling of equipment.
Weapons with enhancements can be created in PCGen by selecting the base weapon and clicking Add Custom. This wil allow you to add masterwork, magical enhancements, special materials etc to create the perfect damage dealer.
On the Spells > Prepared Spells Tab you'll see Spell List field.  You can add new spell lists (sets of spells you have memorized e.g City, Dungeoneering, Wilderness travel) by adding a new name in the text box and clicking on the Add button.
On the Spell Tab to see the number of spells you can cast in a day you need to select your spell casting class in the left-hand pane.
The Inventory > Purchase tab shows all of the gear you own. You need to equip the gear on the Inventory > Equipping tab before it affects your character though. You can even set up groups of equipment that you'd use (e.g. City, Party, Combat).  You can then print these sets out showing the changed effects on your movement and skills!
If you ever see something that doesn't make sense to you, look on the trouble-shooting preview. To get to that, click on the "Character Sheet" tab. Select the "Troubleshooting.htm" sheet. You will see all the various abilities, skills, hit points, saving throws, and the like all expanded with a tag in [] showing where it came from. Very useful for tracking down that strange -1 that shows up.
You can save buffs with your character - just apply them on the Temporary Bonuses tab. The effects of the buffs will then be included when you output your character.  
The -2 circumstance penalty for not having thieves tools is a temporary bonus you can apply in the Temporary Bonus Tab. Other circumstantial bonuses such as riding without a saddle or having your familiar within 5' are available in this tab as well.
There are lots of ways to customize PCGen. Use the Tools > Preferences menu to access the Preferences dialog.
PCGEN doesn't always deal with leveling down perfectly.  So before you level up a character, make sure that you back up the pcg file first. That way if you choose the wrong class etc., you can go back and do it properly.
Confused about gold in your inventory?  Remember to purchase coins, gems etc. with your pooled gold to get them shown on your inventory. Ideally the pooled gold should always be at 0.
You will see small &gt;, &lt;, &lt;up&gt; and &lt;down&gt; arrows on the panes of the PCGEN windows. You can click on these to get one of the panes to expand to its full width/length.
