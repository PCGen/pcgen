<b>Welcome to PCGen!</b><br>If you ever need help, hit F1 or see the Documentation in the Help menu. The Character Creation Walkthrough is a great place to start.
The "Things to be Done" list in the bottom left of the Summary tab will guide you on what needs to be done for your character. You can even click on an item to be taken to the appropriate tab and field. 
PCGen supports a huge range of source books. Some of the most popular combinations have been set up for you in the Basic list of sources. However you can always create your own combinations on the Advanced sources tab and click Save Source Selection so they show up on the Basic list for you next time. 
Use the File > Export or File > Print to output great character sheets. We support HTML and PDF output as well as output to files which can be loaded into real time tools.
Using the Qualified toggle buttons on each tab will trim the list down to just the options that you can take.
The Affordable toggle button on the Purchase tab only shows those items you have the funds for.

# Game mode specific items go here
Don't forget bonus skill points from intelligence are only applied at the time, not retroactively, so if you increase your intelligence later on, you will not get bonus skill points from your previous levels.
If you have a positive Intelligence modifier remember to choose your bonus languages at first level, selecting them after first level is not allowed unless you enable the house rule to bypass this restriction. Click the 'Lang, Weap Prof &amp; SA' button on the Summary Tab to select Languages. See the preferences for House Rules options.
Currently the Modern dataset does not grant any Action Points. A temporary modifier named 'Action Point Tracker' can be found in the Temporary Bonus Sub-Tab of the Inventory Tab under Templates. <br><br>You can apply this as many times as you need to get your total correct. The total is displayed on the first page of the Modern OS.
The <b>Wealth system</b> in the <b>MSRD</b> is not fully implemented within PCGen, though it is fairly easy to work around the limitations. When adding the first level of a base class you are prompted to choose the result of your starting wealth roll which you will need to make manually. This roll is added to any bonuses granted from your starting occupation and/or feats which may effect Wealth and that is your Starting Wealth Score. The starting Wealth Score and Current Wealth Score are displayed on the Abilities Tab in the Special Abilities window and on the Special Abilities Block of the OS. Your Current Wealth Score is displayed in the lower right pane of the Class Tab as well as on the first page of the OS. Since Wealth is fluid and can change based on circumstances within the game a Temporary Bonus exists named <b>Wealth Adjustment</b> which allows you to do exactly that. You will find this in the <b>Temporary Bonus Sub-Tab</b> of the <b>Inventory Tab</b> under <b>Templates</b>. You can apply a modifier from 10 to -10, if you need more or there is more than one adjustment to make you can apply the Wealth Adjustment as many times as is needed. Wealth Adjustment is applied to the Current Wealth Score and leaves the Starting Wealth Score untouched.<br><br><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Buying stuff.</span></b> PCGen does not yet support the abstract wealth system presented in the Modern rules. As a work around we use the COST attribute to hold the Buy DC of the item instead of its monetary value. You should check the box marked 'Ignore Cost', consult the Buy DC of the item and your Current Wealth Score and make your rolls manually.
There is currently no way to set your allegiances in PCGen. The OS has an allegiances field, where you can manually add those if you want to.
The -4 circumstance penalty to melee attacks for being prone is a temporary bonus you can apply in the Temporary Bonus Tab which is a subtab of the Inventory Tab. Other circumstantial bonuses such as ability damage or being blind are available in this tab as well.
In PCGen you will find two versions of each ammo, one is a bundle in which it is sold and one is a single projectile. The two versions are identical accept for the name, the Purchase DC listed is always for the bundle, you can't buy single bullets.<br><br>The single projectile version exists for the convenience of being able to add an exact amount of these items to the character sheet, they will appear on the sheet with check boxes handy for tracking spent ammo. You can also load bullets into firearms in the Equipping Tab and checkboxes will appear under the firearms listing in the main Equipment Block
Because of limitations with the PCGen code the Smart Hero's Linguist talent will not appear as a talent choice at first level. If you want to select it at first level anyway, close the Feat Choice window without making a selection, add the necessary ranks in the Read/Write Language and Speak Language skills on the Skills tab, and select Linguist as one of the feats on the Feats tab.
On the FX Tab you'll see SpellBook textbox.  You can add new spell books (in reality sets of spells you have prepared) by adding a new name in the text box and clicking on the Add button.
On the FX Tab to see the number of spells you can cast in a day you need to select your spell casting class in the left-hand pane.

You can save buffs with your character - just apply them on the Temporary Bonuses tab. The effects of the buffs will then be included when you output your character.  
There are lots of ways to customize PCGen. Use the Tools > Preferences menu to access the Preferences dialog.
PCGEN doesn't always deal with leveling down perfectly.  So before you level up a character, make sure that you back up the pcg file first. That way if you choose the wrong class etc., you can go back and do it properly.
You will see small &gt;, &lt;, &lt;up&gt; and &lt;down&gt; arrows on the panes of the PCGEN windows. You can click on these to get one of the panes to expand to its full width/length.
