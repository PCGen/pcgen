# Created July, 2015 Tom Parker
# This file represents a conversion mechanism for items that were previously
# stand-alone tokens (and had defaults set by a facet), but are now handled
# internally by the new Formula System.
#
# This file does not need to be referenced by a set of data or game mode
# unless that data uses a global modifier file (GLOBALMODIFIER: in a PCC file)
#
# Once a dataset takes on the responsibility of a GLOBALMODIFIER file, then it 
# MUST include these entries in one of the GLOBALMODIFIER files.
